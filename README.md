# MasakhaNEWS: News Topic Classification for African Languages

[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09972) |  [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/masakhane/masakhanews)

>African languages are severely under-represented in NLP research due to lack of datasets covering several NLP tasks. While there are individual language specific datasets that are being expanded to different tasks, only a handful of NLP tasks (e.g. named entity recognition and machine translation) have standardized benchmark datasets covering several geographical and typologically-diverse African languages. In this paper, we develop MasakhaNEWS -- a new benchmark dataset for news topic classification covering 16 languages widely spoken in Africa. We provide an evaluation of baseline models by training classical machine learning models and fine-tuning several language models. Furthermore, we explore several alternatives to full fine-tuning of language models that are better suited for zero-shot and few-shot learning such as cross-lingual parameter-efficient fine-tuning (like MAD-X), pattern exploiting training (PET), prompting language models (like ChatGPT), and prompt-free sentence transformer fine-tuning (SetFit and Cohere Embedding API). Our evaluation in zero-shot setting shows the potential of prompting ChatGPT for news topic classification in low-resource African languages, achieving an average performance of 70 F1 points without leveraging additional supervision like MAD-X. In few-shot setting, we show that with as little as 10 examples per label, we achieved more than 90\% (i.e. 86.0 F1 points) of the performance of full supervised training (92.6 F1 points) leveraging the PET approach.

## Languages
There are 16 languages available :
    
    - Amharic (amh)
    - English (eng)
    - French (fra)
    - Hausa (hau)
    - Igbo (ibo)
    - Lingala (lin)
    - Luganda (lug)
    - Oromo (orm)
    - Nigerian Pidgin (pcm)
    - Rundi (run)
    - chiShona (sna)
    - Somali (som)
    - Kiswahili (swą)
    - Tigrinya (tir)
    - isiXhosa (xho)
    - Yorùbá (yor)

### Monolingual Corpus
We obtained the data mostly from BBC news, and a few other websites like VOA (Lingala, chiShona), Gambuuze (Luganda), Kwayedza (chiShona), Isolezwe (isiXhosa). The corpus can be obtained from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dA5MGvsjvYFuJKl37pwhPFnVEIB6O0hU?usp=sharing)

### Data Splits

For all languages, there are three splits.

The original splits were named `train`, `dev` and `test` and they correspond to the `train`, `validation` and `test` splits.

The splits have the following sizes :

| Language        | train | validation | test |
|-----------------|------:|-----------:|-----:|
| Amharic         |  1311 |        188 |  376 |
| English         |  3309 |        472 |  948 |
| French          |  1476 |        211 |  422 |
| Hausa           |  2219 |        317 |  637 |
| Igbo            |  1356 |        194 |  390 |
| Lingala     	  |   608 |         87 |  175 |
| Luganda         |   771 |        110 |  223 |
| Oromo           |  1015 |        145 |  292 |
| Nigerian-Pidgin |  1060 |        152 |  305 |
| Rundi           |  1117 |        159 |  322 |
| chiShona        |  1288 |        185 |  369 |
| Somali          |  1021 |        148 |  294 |
| Kiswahili       |  1658 |        237 |  476 |
| Tigrinya        |   947 |        137 |  272 |
| isiXhosa        |  1032 |        147 |  297 |
| Yoruba          |  1433 |        206 |  411 |
