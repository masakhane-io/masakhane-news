Di strike bin suppose start on Monday but di AON President Abdulmunaf Sarina tok inside statement wey six members of di association jointly sign say dem announce di suspension say dem do am in di interest of di national economy and security considerations.

Abdulmunaf Sarina, president of di operators for letter wey e send to Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika say di high cost of di fuel dey affect di operation cost of airlines. E say, ""while aviation fuel worldwide dey cost about 40% of airline operating cost globally, di present hike don increase Nigeria operating cost to about 95%."" Abdulmunaf Sarina say airlines dey run at a loss sake of di situation and e no good for dia business. ""Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) hereby wish to regrettably inform di general public say member airlines go discontinue operations nationwide wit effect from Monday May 9, 2022 until further notice."" Nigeria Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika say true-true aviation fuel don cost and e dey affect air transport. But di minister say make di operators look for anoda means to address di mata rather dan suspend flight activities. E say, im no fit do much because mata wey concern fuel no dey under im ministry. ""While efforts to manage di situation dey on, we wish to appeal to di airline operators, even in di difficult situation, to consider di multiplier effect of shutting down operations, on Nigerians and global travellers, in taking dia business-informed decisions and actions,"" e tok for statement by im special assistant on public affairs, Dr James Odaudu. Dis no be di first time operators bin plan to take dis kain action. Wen e happun e dey affect air travel. For March dis year, di operators bin complain about di same aviation fuel but dem no fit reach resolution wit goment and stakeholders for di oil industry. Earlier dis year, airline operators increase price or air fare by 50%. For instance, a trip of N23,000 before increase to N50,000. Di operators claim say di increase for di price of tickets na sake of di high cost of aviation fuel. Air travellers complain wella during dat period but pipo still continue to travel by air.

Di six airline operators wey bin sign di statement to suspend strike include Abdulmunaf - Managing Director of Azman Air; Shehu Wada - Executive Director of Max Air; and Obiora Okonkwo - Chairman of United Nigeria Airlines. Odas be Roy Ilegbodu - Chief Executive Officer of Arik Air; Abdullahi Mahmood - Chief Executive Officer of Aero Contractors; and Allen Onyema - Chairman of Air Peace. Earlier, di Ministry of Aviation bin assured Nigerians say members of AON bin dey review dia decision to withdraw services on Monday, May 9. Dem bin confam say Ibom Air, Green Africa Airlines, Arik Air, Dana Air, and odas go carry on with dia normal flight schedules. Incidents of insecurity don make some Nigerians avoid travelling by road. Di recent Kaduna-Abuja train attack by terrorists also neva comot from pipo mind. If airlines suspend dia operations as planned, Nigerians go begin look for oda means of traveling. Though Ibom airline don announce say dem no go join di suspension - only dem no go fit cater for all di thousands of travellers wey dey make dia trip by air. But di remaining alternative go come be di use of private jets or airplane charter. E get several private jet charter companies for Nigeria wey dey offer those services. Di service dey expensive. Findings show say, a 40 minute to one hour trip within di kontri, cost up to N2 million ($5,500). Some pipo fit also do join hire of a private jet wey fit carry specific number of pipo. Dem go share di bill among dem sef. E neva clear weda di airline suspension go take effect from Monday but pipo don begin reason oda alternatives."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-61369130

And Chris normally dey show up for pipo, weda na burial or weddings. E sabi ginger pipo for all occasions. So, on dis day, we show up for am too. But as we no dey dia, e no feel like na di same tin. Chris na my immediate cousin, but dem raise us for di same house and im bin be more like brother to me. Im die for Kisumu for western Kenya on Easter Sunday, afta e sick for few weeks wit liver cirrhosis. Di goment give us di guidelines for e burial. We gatz bury am within three days. But wit many of e family and friends under lockdown for di capital, Nairobi, no be evribodi fit attend di burial. Di sermon bin dey short. Di speeches bin dey restricted. And even singing no too dey. Chris bin love music wen e dey alive - im play di drum kit for di Salvation Army church band. So e dey painful say nobodi bin dey dia to play im favourite songs. I watch as live comments from e friends and colleagues begin appear in on Facebook. In order to use internet comfort demsef, pipo leave RIP messages and tok of how great a man Chris be wen im dey alive. And I bin tink say, maybe I for take screenshots and print am out becos dis mainly become our condolences book. Everytin bin feel so different.  We no fit hug, touch or see each other tears. We no fit throw sand on di coffin as dem dey put am for grave. When pesin wey you love die, we wan cry, look for comfort and closure. But how yo go do dis kind tins wen you no dey dia? I bin vex. I no ever imagine say I go bury my loved one through social media. I no ever tink say I go want human contact that much. E bin dey like feem, except say I dey part of pipo wey act am. And sadly, di Facebook Live fail, due to a poor network connection. So I no fit even watch Chris final journey to di very end. I no see wen dem put e coffin down inside grave. For many African societies death and life are dey togeda. Many traditions see death as rite of passage - a transition to another form. Hence why ancestors dey important - dem be di pipo wey don die but kontinu to ""live"" for di community. Dis, in turn, mean say wen pipo die dem must receive perfect burial - complete with rituals wey dem don observe for generations. For di communities for western Kenya wia I come from, like di Luo and Luhya, wen dem born pesin die and wen di pesin die na two important events. Dem dey treat pesin wey die wit respect and death and burial process dey to follow, to ensure mistake no dey. First of all burials dem no dey rush burials, especially for old pesin. Pesin death na call for celebration, even though pipo dey mourn and cry. E dey take at least one week to bury adult pesin. Loud mourning and crying, go last for days. Pipo come togeda to help di family of di pesin wey die to mourn. Dem go light Bonfire and pipo go gather around dem, embrace, cry, and relive di life of di pesin wey die. To kill animal dey part of di ritual, and di preparation and serving of food and drinks to console mourners. Na show of unity amongst neighbours and family. Dem go bring di dead home a day or two before di burial. They lie in di compound, to show say dem accept and love dem, even in death. Di Luo, a Nilotic people from western Kenya, have among di most elaborate burial customs for Kenya. At least 10 rites dey involved from the announcement of death, to di removal of di shadow or spirit of di dead from di homestead, to di shaving of family members' hair, and finally di remembrance ceremonies for di dead. All dis occasions require pipo to gather and interact in huge numbers. But during dis pandemic, most of dis rituals are dey off-limits, whether di pesin die of Covid-19 or not. During di two days between Chris' death and e burial, dem forbid pipo for house to sing with loud voice for night, becos dem go attract di neighbours wey go want come cry wit di family. Dem no light any bonfires to sit around. And during di burial, even for grave site, no hugging, or touching, no handshakes or kisses dey allowed. Goment representatives bin dey dia to ensure say pipo follow di rules f social distancing. Forty days afta dem bury somebody, dem suppose hold memorial service - di final celebration of dia life. Again, we no go fit do dis for Chris. I get dis feeling say I don only partially cry for Chris. Dis no be how e for deserve make pipo mourn am. Maybe wen all dis end - when we fit hug again, and cry for each other arms - we go mourn am like we suppose."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/world-52781527
