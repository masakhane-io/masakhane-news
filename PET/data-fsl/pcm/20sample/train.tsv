politics	John Mahama vs Nana Akufo-Addo: Ghana elections 2020 economy and corruption score card	Ghana elections 2020 campaigns don end, now de 7 December polls proper be upon us. So for help Ghanaians get better understanding of de issues affecting Monday voting, BBC Pidgin torchlight de west African country economy and corruption scorecard since 2012. Ghana election 2020 na majorly between two candidates wey don once serve as President for Ghana within de last eight years. Former president John Dramani Mahama of de National Democratic Congress [NDC] and de incumbent president, Nana Akufo-Addo of de New Patriotic Party [NPP] be de main contestants for Ghana 2020 presidential race. Dis time de two candidates dey ask for four more years to make Ghana great again. Make we take a look at some key sectors, wetin dema promise versus wetin dem achieve for dia first term for office. NDC Manifesto promise for 2012 To focus im economic development priorities to better di lives of Ghanaians through investment and development policies • Maintain single digit rate of inflation; • Ensure exchange rate stability • Reduce gbese significantly • Maintain average annual growth rate of at least 8% NPP Manifesto promise for 2016 To build di most business-friendly and pipo friendly economy for Africa, wey go create jobs and prosperity for all Ghanaians. Achieve double digit GDP growth annually for four years Reduce di cost of doing business, maintain financial discipline, reduce government borrowing and reduce interest rates to encourage private businesses. Tori pipo for Fact check Ghana bin do research and dis na wetin dem find out as dem quote World Bank data to compare di monetray value and di GDP under di tenure of di Mahama-led NDC government and di incumbent Akufo-led NPP. From dis table, e show say under di Mahama-led NDC government, Ghana record GDP growth of 15.836 wey be average of 3.959% growth every year. Akufo-led government don record an accumulated growth of 21.784% wey translates to an average of 5.446%. Dis one mean say di GDP of Ghana don grow higher under di NPP goment than di NDC. NPP manifesto for 2016 promise; To commit to establish solid, efficient machinery for good governance, wey go make up of accountable goment and respect for di rule of law and human rights. One of di things wey dem promise to do na to establish, by  Act of Parliament, di Office of di Special Prosecutor, wey go dey independent of di Executive, Di special prosecutor go investigate and prosecute certain categories of cases and allegations of corruption and other criminal wrongdoing. All dis to ensure transparency for goment. NDC manifesto for 2012 promise; To stand gidigba to fight political corruption and immorality For di manifesto, di party promise to use di 2008 party promise to run di 2012 political tenure. For 2008, di NDC goment promise to deepen political accountability and transparency, disclose  budgets, public expenditure and procedures. How tins be? For one statement wey NPP release afta di resignation of di Special Prosecutor on Monday, 17th November, 2020, di party say di  record of corruption under di NDC leadership dey worst. Di Flagbearer of di NDC, John Mahama, during dia manifesto launch on September 7 for di University of Professional Studies, Accra condemn NDC performance on corruption. From wetin we gather from di Corruption Perception Index (CPI) report wey Transparency Index dey release every year to give insight on di presence of corruption in public office under a particular goment. See di table wey Fact Check Ghana draw up from Transparency Index report. Even though di CPI report for 2020 neva comot, di worst CPI score (di highest corruption perception) under di Mahama goment beta pass di best CPI score (di lowest corruption perception) under di Akufo-Addo NPP goment. Dis one mean say di Mahama led NDC goment handle corruption pass di Akufo Addo NPP goment. So now element number three which dey make Ghana elections exciting be say dis year, Ghanaians dey choose between govment which dey build infrastructure or govment wey dey strengthen economy. De opposition NDC John Mahama dey campaign on de grounds of en infrastructural achievement between 2012 - 2016. He build chaw top class hospitals, roads like circle interchange, new terminal for Ghana airport den stuff which more Ghanaians start dey appreciate after dem vote am out of power. Meanwhile, Prez Akufo-Addo too dey campaign on en record of economic transformation, growth in agriculture through planting for food and jobs, clean up of de banking sector, en handling of de COVID-19 pandemic den stuff. If Ghanaians vote give NDC, e mean say dem prefer physical infrastructure but if dem retain Prez Akufo-Addo, e mean say dem prefer say govment go build de economy.	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-55112945

Di Southeast Asian kontri dey account for more dan half of world palm oil supply, don sama ban on anykind Wetin cause di export ban be say Indonesia pipo don start protest against increase for di price of cooking oil. Di price increase don disturb dia local supply. So di question now be say wia Africa wey dey import oil wela go turn to next for supply. For 2021, Africa bin spend five billion dollars to import estimate of four million metric tonnes of palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia.

Nigeria bin dey produce one small 1.4m metric tonnes for 2021, compare to Indonesia 44.5 million metric tonnes. Di ban dey come just a month since global sunflower oil supply bin dey thrown off-balance. Na di Ukraine-Russia war, as dat one bin add pressure to household budgets.
