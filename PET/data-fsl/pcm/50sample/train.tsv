Of all di teams wey remain for di tournament, di one wey I like for every department na Italy. If you look back for every major finals wey I fit remember, di eventual winners dey always get one knockout game wia dem no really play well and dem still go through. If Italy pass dis tie, however dem take do am, then dem get great chance of winning di whole tin. I no think say dem get many weaknesses. Prediction: 1-2 Head-to-head Dis na di fifth match between dis two sides for major tournament, but di first for knockout stage. Italy don win three of di previous four matches for a major tournament, dem draw di oda one. Italy 2-0  win for Lyon for di group stage for Euro 2016 na dia most recent game against Belgium.

Thorgen Hazard don scor four goals and two assists for im last seven starts. Italy Italy don reach di European Championship quarter-finals for the fourth tournament in a row. Three of dia most recent quarter-final appearances don end for penalty shoot-out -  wia dem lose to Spain for 2008, dem beat England for 2012 and lose to Germany for 2016.

Last month, MPs increase Kenya debt go 11% and dis help di goment finance im budget for di next 12 months. Prices of goods and services rise quickly in more than five years. Dis na di situation wey don force goment to introduce food and fuel subsidies. Di rise in commodity prices don make am difficult for Kenyans to continue dia lives as usual. For example, two-kilogram packet of corn flour don reach two dollars from 1.2 dollars e dey in di past three months. Dat na 67% increase. Dis move by goment to set subsidies and allow corn meal traders to import corn from neighbouring countries no still dey successful even as dem reduce di price of these products to one dollar for a two-kilogram bag. Russian war also contribute well-well to di plenty money wey climb on top di  price of commodity. And about 30% to 50% of Kenya wheat flour dey come from Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine sell less than 60% of wheat dis year compared to 2021, one issue wey cause di price of wheat and dia products like bread to rise. Di rate of youth unemployment for Kenya increase for di first quarter of 2021, compared to di previous quarter.

Kenya economic growth don reach 5.5% in 2022 and e dey expected to reach 5.2% on average between 2023-24. Di growth rate, although still dey strong, go dey moderate following di remarkable recovery for 2021 from di worst economic effects wey corona epidemic cause, when di kontri economy grow by 7.5 percent, wey be higher rate dan di average growth of economy for di African region and di Sahara desert of 4%. Corruption na often one of di biggest problems for Kenya. Kenya head of public service, Joseph Kinyua, estimate say dem dey lose one-third of di national annual budget to corruption, while accounting firm KPMG LLP say abuses and crime plus bribery and bid rigging dey consume about 10% of a national income of $95 billion annually. President Uhuru Kenyatta last year tok say dem dey tiff about 2 billion shillings every day from di goment. Kenya score only 30 out of a possible 100 for im anti-corruption efforts for Transparency International 2021 Global Corruption Perceptions Index.

politics	John Mahama vs Nana Akufo-Addo: Ghana elections 2020 economy and corruption score card	Ghana elections 2020 campaigns don end, now de 7 December polls proper be upon us. So for help Ghanaians get better understanding of de issues affecting Monday voting, BBC Pidgin torchlight de west African country economy and corruption scorecard since 2012. Ghana election 2020 na majorly between two candidates wey don once serve as President for Ghana within de last eight years. Former president John Dramani Mahama of de National Democratic Congress [NDC] and de incumbent president, Nana Akufo-Addo of de New Patriotic Party [NPP] be de main contestants for Ghana 2020 presidential race. Dis time de two candidates dey ask for four more years to make Ghana great again. Make we take a look at some key sectors, wetin dema promise versus wetin dem achieve for dia first term for office. NDC Manifesto promise for 2012 To focus im economic development priorities to better di lives of Ghanaians through investment and development policies • Maintain single digit rate of inflation; • Ensure exchange rate stability • Reduce gbese significantly • Maintain average annual growth rate of at least 8% NPP Manifesto promise for 2016 To build di most business-friendly and pipo friendly economy for Africa, wey go create jobs and prosperity for all Ghanaians. Achieve double digit GDP growth annually for four years Reduce di cost of doing business, maintain financial discipline, reduce government borrowing and reduce interest rates to encourage private businesses. Tori pipo for Fact check Ghana bin do research and dis na wetin dem find out as dem quote World Bank data to compare di monetray value and di GDP under di tenure of di Mahama-led NDC government and di incumbent Akufo-led NPP. From dis table, e show say under di Mahama-led NDC government, Ghana record GDP growth of 15.836 wey be average of 3.959% growth every year. Akufo-led government don record an accumulated growth of 21.784% wey translates to an average of 5.446%. Dis one mean say di GDP of Ghana don grow higher under di NPP goment than di NDC. NPP manifesto for 2016 promise; To commit to establish solid, efficient machinery for good governance, wey go make up of accountable goment and respect for di rule of law and human rights. One of di things wey dem promise to do na to establish, by  Act of Parliament, di Office of di Special Prosecutor, wey go dey independent of di Executive, Di special prosecutor go investigate and prosecute certain categories of cases and allegations of corruption and other criminal wrongdoing. All dis to ensure transparency for goment. NDC manifesto for 2012 promise; To stand gidigba to fight political corruption and immorality For di manifesto, di party promise to use di 2008 party promise to run di 2012 political tenure. For 2008, di NDC goment promise to deepen political accountability and transparency, disclose  budgets, public expenditure and procedures. How tins be? For one statement wey NPP release afta di resignation of di Special Prosecutor on Monday, 17th November, 2020, di party say di  record of corruption under di NDC leadership dey worst. Di Flagbearer of di NDC, John Mahama, during dia manifesto launch on September 7 for di University of Professional Studies, Accra condemn NDC performance on corruption. From wetin we gather from di Corruption Perception Index (CPI) report wey Transparency Index dey release every year to give insight on di presence of corruption in public office under a particular goment. See di table wey Fact Check Ghana draw up from Transparency Index report. Even though di CPI report for 2020 neva comot, di worst CPI score (di highest corruption perception) under di Mahama goment beta pass di best CPI score (di lowest corruption perception) under di Akufo-Addo NPP goment. Dis one mean say di Mahama led NDC goment handle corruption pass di Akufo Addo NPP goment. So now element number three which dey make Ghana elections exciting be say dis year, Ghanaians dey choose between govment which dey build infrastructure or govment wey dey strengthen economy. De opposition NDC John Mahama dey campaign on de grounds of en infrastructural achievement between 2012 - 2016. He build chaw top class hospitals, roads like circle interchange, new terminal for Ghana airport den stuff which more Ghanaians start dey appreciate after dem vote am out of power. Meanwhile, Prez Akufo-Addo too dey campaign on en record of economic transformation, growth in agriculture through planting for food and jobs, clean up of de banking sector, en handling of de COVID-19 pandemic den stuff. If Ghanaians vote give NDC, e mean say dem prefer physical infrastructure but if dem retain Prez Akufo-Addo, e mean say dem prefer say govment go build de economy.	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-55112945

Di Southeast Asian kontri dey account for more dan half of world palm oil supply, don sama ban on anykind Wetin cause di export ban be say Indonesia pipo don start protest against increase for di price of cooking oil. Di price increase don disturb dia local supply. So di question now be say wia Africa wey dey import oil wela go turn to next for supply. For 2021, Africa bin spend five billion dollars to import estimate of four million metric tonnes of palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia. One tonne of palm oil be about $1,850 for di commodity exchange for Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia. E den add, anoda 150 to 200 US dollars for transport and handling costs, per tonne.

Nigeria bin dey produce one small 1.4m metric tonnes for 2021, compare to Indonesia 44.5 million metric tonnes. Di ban dey come just a month since global sunflower oil supply bin dey thrown off-balance. Na di Ukraine-Russia war, as dat one bin add pressure to household budgets.

While Pakistan and Bangladesh import nearly 80% of dia palm oil from Indonesia. Connie Magomu, di General Manager, National Oil Palm Project, for Uganda say di ban sef be opportunity. Magomu see am as good chance for Africa kontries to develop dia own palm oil sector. ""E dey very efficient for land use, as e dey produce more oil per unit area dan any oda crop wey we sabi (E dey give between four to 10 times more oil per unit area)."" ""E be also one good crop for poverty reduction sake of once e reach maturity for three and half years. ""E go dey harvested every 10 days for 20 to 25 years"", She add.

Dem accuse di president of covering up di theft of one large sum of foreign currency from im farm in 2020, some of which bin dey hidden inside one sofa. Di debate before di vote bin focus on an independent report wey conclude say e fit don violate di constitution. Oga Ramaphosa, wey dey prepare for re-election as ANC leader, deny any wrongdoing. Di African National Congress bin tell im MPs to block possible impeachment - although a handful break ranks and join hand with opposition parties and vote to accept di report and let impeachment proceedings start. Now wey Oga Ramaphosa don survive di vote, belief dey say e dey likely to win re-election for im party conference, wey go start on Friday. E go den be in pole position to become di ANC presidential candidate for di next election in 2024. Di sitting to debate to di report, wey dey commission from one panel of legal experts by di speaker, open wit one discussion over whether dem should allow MPs to vote in secret - something wey di speaker bin reject. At di end of di debate, dem read out di names of individual MPs and each one announce dia vote. Some 214 lawmakers vote against setting up impeachment committee, while 148 vote in favour, dem register two abstention. Di 70-year-old leader don deny any wrongdoing calling di report, wey e don also challenge for di Constitutional Court, ""flawed"". Oga Ramaphosa become president for 2018 pledging to tackle corruption. Naim  replace Jacob Zuma, whose time for office bin dey weighed down by many such allegations. Dis scandal show facein June, wen one former South African spy boss, Zuma-ally Arthur Fraser, file one complaint wit police accusingdi president of hiding theft of $4m (£3.25m) in cash from im Phala Phala game farm in 2020. Oga Ramaphosa admit say dem bin tiff some money, wey bin dey hidden in a sofa, but e say na $580,000 not $4m. Di president say di $580,000 bin come from di sale of buffalo, but di panel, wey dey headed by one former chief justice, say e get ""substantial doubt"" about whether a sale take place. South Africa get strict rules on holding foreign currency, wey say dat it gatz dey deposited with an authorised dealer such as bank with 30 days. E appears as though di president fit don break those rules, according to di panel report. Furthermore, if di money na from selling buffalo as e tok, dis money supposed dey declared, rather dan keep am in cash. For im submission to di Constitutional Court, Oga Ramaphosa want di kontri top judges to rule say di findings of di panel dey unlawful and set aside. Di president argue say di panel go beyond im scope wen dem dey look  at whether e bin get a case to answer related to di robbery for di farm. E dey also ask di court make dem declare say any steps wey di parliament take on di back of di release of the report dey unlawful and invalid. Analysis by Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg Di dominance of di ANC for parliament don save Oga Ramaphosa future in politics. Im chances of being re-elected as ANC president for di party national conference now don get more boost. However, events for parliament show say once again deep divisionsdey for di governing party. Four Pro-Zuma supporters, wey include former African Union chairperson, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma - one ogbonge party member - bin vote with opposition parties. Di opposition bin try, and fail, to push for secret ballot as dem sense say more members fit break ranks. But Tuesday win na only political, and not legally binding. Oga Ramaphosa go still need to get di Constitutional Court to weigh in on di mata, though some experts say di judges dey likely to side wit am afta parliament, wey commission di investigate, bin reject im own report. For now, on top of one huge sigh of relief, Oga Ramaphosa march on wit severe political bruises - im credibility and ability to govern go come into even sharper focus."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c9rl22gyln4o

Na fifteen candidates dey battle for di govnorship seat of Osun and all of dem na male. Out of di fifteen deputy govnorship candidates, only six of dem be female. Di fact say no female govnorship candidate for di Osun election further show say na men dominate di Nigerian political space and female representation still dey low despite call for more women to join politics and be part of di affairs of nation building. Since di creation of di state, no woman don become elected govnor. Di Osun State govnorship election fit big pass di recently concluded one for Ekiti State wey see Biodun Oyebanji of di All Progressives Congress (APC) win becos of di population and if more pipo come out to vote.

While Ekiti State get just 16 local goment areas, Osun State get 30 local goment areas.

For di first round of di election, Adeleke of di Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) score 254,698 votes, while Oyetola of di All Progressives Congress (APC) score 254,345 votes. Iyiola Omisore of Social Democratic Party (SDP) score 128,049 votes, Adeoti Moshood Olalekan of Action Democratic Party (ADP) score 49,744 votes, while Fatai Akinade Akinbade of African Democratic Congress (ADC) score 7,681.

Section 153 of di Electoral Act tok say Inec go need to conduct a rerun if di margin of victory for election dey lower dan di number of voters for units wia dem cancel elections. So a rerun need to hold for areas wia dem cancel elections. INEC conduct di rerun between di two top candidates on September 27 2018, and by di time dem collate all di previous and current results, Oyetola score 255,505 votes, while Adeleke score 255,023.

Di last election for di state na in 2018 wey di current Govnor Gboyega Oyetola win as im defeat Ademola Adeleke of di Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Di election go be di seventh gubernatorial election for di state. Na di military regime of Ibrahim Babangida create Osun State from di old Oyo State for August 27, 1991. Isiaka Adeleke, broda of di PDP govnorship candidate, become di govnor of di state for January 1992 till November 1993 wen di military junta of Babangida dissolve all political offices afta im annul di June 12 presidential election. Di electoral system na modified two-round system, wey mean say before candidate fit dey declared as winner, im need to receive di plurality of di votes and ova 25% of di votes for at least two-thirds of di state local goment areas. If any candidate no get to dis level, dem go hold anoda round of election between di top candidates. For di second round, any candidate wey receive a plurality of votes for di highest number of local goment areas na im win di election. Di tenure of Gboyega Oyetola go come to an end for November 2022 and di winner of di July 16 govnorship election go begin a new goment.
