politics	John Mahama vs Nana Akufo-Addo: Ghana elections 2020 economy and corruption score card	Ghana elections 2020 campaigns don end, now de 7 December polls proper be upon us. So for help Ghanaians get better understanding of de issues affecting Monday voting, BBC Pidgin torchlight de west African country economy and corruption scorecard since 2012. Ghana election 2020 na majorly between two candidates wey don once serve as President for Ghana within de last eight years. Former president John Dramani Mahama of de National Democratic Congress [NDC] and de incumbent president, Nana Akufo-Addo of de New Patriotic Party [NPP] be de main contestants for Ghana 2020 presidential race. Dis time de two candidates dey ask for four more years to make Ghana great again. Make we take a look at some key sectors, wetin dema promise versus wetin dem achieve for dia first term for office. NDC Manifesto promise for 2012 To focus im economic development priorities to better di lives of Ghanaians through investment and development policies • Maintain single digit rate of inflation; • Ensure exchange rate stability • Reduce gbese significantly • Maintain average annual growth rate of at least 8% NPP Manifesto promise for 2016 To build di most business-friendly and pipo friendly economy for Africa, wey go create jobs and prosperity for all Ghanaians. Achieve double digit GDP growth annually for four years Reduce di cost of doing business, maintain financial discipline, reduce government borrowing and reduce interest rates to encourage private businesses. Tori pipo for Fact check Ghana bin do research and dis na wetin dem find out as dem quote World Bank data to compare di monetray value and di GDP under di tenure of di Mahama-led NDC government and di incumbent Akufo-led NPP. From dis table, e show say under di Mahama-led NDC government, Ghana record GDP growth of 15.836 wey be average of 3.959% growth every year. Akufo-led government don record an accumulated growth of 21.784% wey translates to an average of 5.446%. Dis one mean say di GDP of Ghana don grow higher under di NPP goment than di NDC. NPP manifesto for 2016 promise; To commit to establish solid, efficient machinery for good governance, wey go make up of accountable goment and respect for di rule of law and human rights. One of di things wey dem promise to do na to establish, by  Act of Parliament, di Office of di Special Prosecutor, wey go dey independent of di Executive, Di special prosecutor go investigate and prosecute certain categories of cases and allegations of corruption and other criminal wrongdoing. All dis to ensure transparency for goment. NDC manifesto for 2012 promise; To stand gidigba to fight political corruption and immorality For di manifesto, di party promise to use di 2008 party promise to run di 2012 political tenure. For 2008, di NDC goment promise to deepen political accountability and transparency, disclose  budgets, public expenditure and procedures. How tins be? For one statement wey NPP release afta di resignation of di Special Prosecutor on Monday, 17th November, 2020, di party say di  record of corruption under di NDC leadership dey worst. Di Flagbearer of di NDC, John Mahama, during dia manifesto launch on September 7 for di University of Professional Studies, Accra condemn NDC performance on corruption. From wetin we gather from di Corruption Perception Index (CPI) report wey Transparency Index dey release every year to give insight on di presence of corruption in public office under a particular goment. See di table wey Fact Check Ghana draw up from Transparency Index report. Even though di CPI report for 2020 neva comot, di worst CPI score (di highest corruption perception) under di Mahama goment beta pass di best CPI score (di lowest corruption perception) under di Akufo-Addo NPP goment. Dis one mean say di Mahama led NDC goment handle corruption pass di Akufo Addo NPP goment. So now element number three which dey make Ghana elections exciting be say dis year, Ghanaians dey choose between govment which dey build infrastructure or govment wey dey strengthen economy. De opposition NDC John Mahama dey campaign on de grounds of en infrastructural achievement between 2012 - 2016. He build chaw top class hospitals, roads like circle interchange, new terminal for Ghana airport den stuff which more Ghanaians start dey appreciate after dem vote am out of power. Meanwhile, Prez Akufo-Addo too dey campaign on en record of economic transformation, growth in agriculture through planting for food and jobs, clean up of de banking sector, en handling of de COVID-19 pandemic den stuff. If Ghanaians vote give NDC, e mean say dem prefer physical infrastructure but if dem retain Prez Akufo-Addo, e mean say dem prefer say govment go build de economy.	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-55112945

Dem accuse di president of covering up di theft of one large sum of foreign currency from im farm in 2020, some of which bin dey hidden inside one sofa. Di debate before di vote bin focus on an independent report wey conclude say e fit don violate di constitution. Oga Ramaphosa, wey dey prepare for re-election as ANC leader, deny any wrongdoing. Di African National Congress bin tell im MPs to block possible impeachment - although a handful break ranks and join hand with opposition parties and vote to accept di report and let impeachment proceedings start. Now wey Oga Ramaphosa don survive di vote, belief dey say e dey likely to win re-election for im party conference, wey go start on Friday. E go den be in pole position to become di ANC presidential candidate for di next election in 2024. Di sitting to debate to di report, wey dey commission from one panel of legal experts by di speaker, open wit one discussion over whether dem should allow MPs to vote in secret - something wey di speaker bin reject. At di end of di debate, dem read out di names of individual MPs and each one announce dia vote. Some 214 lawmakers vote against setting up impeachment committee, while 148 vote in favour, dem register two abstention. Di 70-year-old leader don deny any wrongdoing calling di report, wey e don also challenge for di Constitutional Court, ""flawed"". Oga Ramaphosa become president for 2018 pledging to tackle corruption. Naim  replace Jacob Zuma, whose time for office bin dey weighed down by many such allegations. Dis scandal show facein June, wen one former South African spy boss, Zuma-ally Arthur Fraser, file one complaint wit police accusingdi president of hiding theft of $4m (£3.25m) in cash from im Phala Phala game farm in 2020. Oga Ramaphosa admit say dem bin tiff some money, wey bin dey hidden in a sofa, but e say na $580,000 not $4m. Di president say di $580,000 bin come from di sale of buffalo, but di panel, wey dey headed by one former chief justice, say e get ""substantial doubt"" about whether a sale take place. South Africa get strict rules on holding foreign currency, wey say dat it gatz dey deposited with an authorised dealer such as bank with 30 days. E appears as though di president fit don break those rules, according to di panel report. Furthermore, if di money na from selling buffalo as e tok, dis money supposed dey declared, rather dan keep am in cash. For im submission to di Constitutional Court, Oga Ramaphosa want di kontri top judges to rule say di findings of di panel dey unlawful and set aside. Di president argue say di panel go beyond im scope wen dem dey look  at whether e bin get a case to answer related to di robbery for di farm. E dey also ask di court make dem declare say any steps wey di parliament take on di back of di release of the report dey unlawful and invalid. Analysis by Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg Di dominance of di ANC for parliament don save Oga Ramaphosa future in politics. Im chances of being re-elected as ANC president for di party national conference now don get more boost. However, events for parliament show say once again deep divisionsdey for di governing party. Four Pro-Zuma supporters, wey include former African Union chairperson, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma - one ogbonge party member - bin vote with opposition parties. Di opposition bin try, and fail, to push for secret ballot as dem sense say more members fit break ranks. But Tuesday win na only political, and not legally binding. Oga Ramaphosa go still need to get di Constitutional Court to weigh in on di mata, though some experts say di judges dey likely to side wit am afta parliament, wey commission di investigate, bin reject im own report. For now, on top of one huge sigh of relief, Oga Ramaphosa march on wit severe political bruises - im credibility and ability to govern go come into even sharper focus."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c9rl22gyln4o
