health	East of England Ambulance Service: Inside a 999 control room	"Faced with answering thousands of calls a day, often concerning life-or-death emergencies, what is it like to work in an ambulance control room?
""We've now got over 100 calls outstanding, waiting to be responded to,"" says Thomas Pont.
It is Wednesday and the 30-year-old is on shift as duty manager at the East of England Ambulance Service's control room in Hellesdon, near Norwich.
rust has three control rooms, with others in Chelmsford and Bedford.
Hellesdon base dispatches to Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Waveney, in Suffolk.
few days, he says, have been particularly difficult, with delays getting patients into hospital.
""We're not able to respond to patients so we then start stacking up, stacking up and stacking up,"" he says.
Calls are categorised from one - for the most serious and anything immediately life-threatening - to four, which are non life-threatening emergencies requiring transport to hospital.
Mr Pont says they should respond to category two calls within 40 minutes but they are taking 90 minutes - and they are telling those in the less serious categories an ambulance may take 15 hours.
If a doctor calls for a patient who needs to go to hospital, but it is not urgent or time critical, they will be advised it will take 22 hours, he says.
He adds they also advise people that, if they can, they are better getting themselves to hospital.
""That's the reality of the situation we're in at the moment,"" says Mr Pont.
""This is making the best of a bad situation.... It's about us being really open and transparent with people and saying, 'Look, we are struggling'.""
""It gets frustrating looking at jobs and you can't do anything,"" says dispatcher Chantelle Cornwall.
43-year-old's job is to get the most appropriate resource to patients by juggling the priority levels of calls. She is in charge of dispatching 49 crews. 
""You need to be able to multitask. Sometimes, on a crazy day, my head can feel like it's spinning. I have to be able to monitor everything,"" she says.
Ms Cornwall says delays at hospitals can be ""so frustrating"" if it means crews are stuck there.
""It can be difficult, no-one likes to have calls uncovered. It's stressful when you can't cover your own call or everyone is busy dealing with incidents or is stuck at hospital,"" she adds.
""If you haven't dispatched on all your patients by the time you leave, you feel like your job isn't complete.""
ry to reduce the number of calls waiting, the ambulance service is introducing a scheme to use more advanced paramedics or advanced practitioners to get ""the right help to the right people"".
Richard Davis is one of the advanced paramedics on hand.
""It's all about trying to get the right care to the right patient as swiftly as possible,"" he says.
Mr Davis, who has worked in the ambulance service for 20 years, describes the workload as ""stressful"". 
""I walk in that door and I sprint until I try to go home,"" he says.
He is full of praise for his colleagues.
""It's fundamentally an amazing team and I'm not sure they get the appreciation they rightly deserve for what they do, put up with, go through and come back tomorrow and do it all again, day in, day out,"" he says.
mbulance service is improving its call response times after a recruitment drive, says Rob Hazell.
30-year-old, who is in charge of recruitment, says the number of call handlers has increased by 136% within 12 months, something which, he says, has improved the average call pick-up time.
He says in July, the average call pick-up time was one minute and 18 seconds. In November, it was 21 seconds.
Calls waiting for more than two minutes per day were 804 in July. In November, it was 121, he adds.
""The increase in head count has helped massively,"" he says.
""I certainly feel that recruitment and retention has arguably had the biggest impact on what we have been able to serve our patients in terms of calls pick-up and calls waiting.""
But, he says, the trust still has a challenge with retaining staff. 
At the start of the year, he says they lost on average four call handlers every week. That average is now just below two, he says.
Helping staff feel part of a team and a well-being culture has improved retention, says Mr Hazell.
Melissa Rowlands, 39, joined the ambulance service in March 2020 as a call handler, two months after being made redundant from her previous role. 
Now a senior call handler, she says the death of someone she knew ""changed her perspective"" and made her ""realise how you really want to take care of people"".
""It all made sense,"" she says. 
She says there are calls that ""stay with you"".
""I can talk to my partner if I need to but, at work, the green family as we call it, we understand what each other are going through,"" she says.
""I love my job. It can take a toll but we are trying the best we can.""
With Christmas parties, the World Cup and the current cold snap, Ms Rowlands has a message for people heading out. 
""Take a coat out with you, be sensible, have a plan about how to get home,"" she says. ""We are not there to be a taxi service.""

business	Cost of living: Iceland to offer interest-free loans to customers	"Iceland will offer customers interest-free loans to help with their food shop amid soaring inflation. 
upermarket trialled the scheme in Huddersfield and Rhyl, Denbighshire, before rolling it out across Wales, where more than 500 customers used it. 
Managing director Richard Walker said loans - provided by charity-owned lender Fair For You - would only be offered to those who can afford them. 
""real value"" of pay fell by 3% from April to June, according to new data. 
Repayments are set at £10 per week, with customers able to choose the day they are made and overpay if convenient to them. 
me comes after a regional pilot trial, where it found 92% of customers using food banks previously had stopped or reduced their use of them. 
During the pilot phase, customers paid interest on loans, however Iceland have now decided to make all loans interest-free for the national roll-out. 
Rhyl was initially included as a pilot area, before expanding across Wales, as over 500 Welsh customers used the loan service. 
Iceland's 'food club' has teamed-up with ethical lender 'Fair for You' to help customers purchase everyday items.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) found average wages in the UK rose by 4.7% in three months, but this was below the rate of inflation - which was 9.4%. 
gap between pay growth and inflation is the biggest since records began more than 20 years ago, as the current inflation figure is 9.4%, while wage growth falls far behind at 4.7%.
frozen food provider also reported that this year 8.4 million people are going hungry, and 9 million families who receive benefits will be an average of £500 worse off due to inflation.
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live this morning, Iceland's managing director Richard Walker said: ""We started piloting for 18 months in some of the most deprived areas around the UK and actually the results were phenomenal. 
""The Social Impact Reporting showed that over 90% of people reduced their need to go to food banks, improved people's credit scores, their mental health, they ate better, and 70% of them didn't fall behind on essentials like rent and council tax.""
He went on to explain how the loan actually works: ""You can apply online you get a response as quickly as in an hour. 
""We're not the loan provider but Fair for You will only loan to people who can afford to repay it.
""Those on a regular salary and people who are who are well off, it wouldn't apply, and nor would someone who you know, quite frankly couldn't afford to repay.""
When asked what happens if the loan is not repaid on time, Mr Walker said: ""It's a collaborative, flexible process, people are helped not harassed. 
""The debt is not sold off to third parties, and third party debt collectors are not brought in. 
""Actually, everyone is put on a flexible long term payment plan if they can't afford to repay.""
Successful applicants for the loan will receive a preloaded food club card within five to seven business days.
Iceland chain began in the 1970s, founded by Mr Walker's father, and now has nearly 1,000 UK stores, with its headquarters on Deeside industrial park in Flintshire."	/news/uk-wales-62560997
entertainment	I'm a Celebrity: Jill Scott wins as Matt Hancock MP finishes third	"Footballer Jill Scott has won ITV reality series I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! while actor Owen Warner came second and former health secretary Matt Hancock finished third.
Scott said she ""couldn't believe"" she had been crowned Queen of the Jungle.
Hancock's participation in the show has been controversial and led to him having the Tory whip suspended.
Asked by hosts Ant and Dec why he took part, Hancock said: ""I wanted to show what I'm like as a person.
""Lots of people come to me with pre-conceived ideas for obvious reasons, and I just wanted to be myself,"" he continued.
Watch: Matt Hancock admits he knew it was controversial to go on I'm A Celebrity
""But I also believe that for politicians as a whole, we don't come across as human enough. And this is probably the most extreme way of showing who you are.""
He added: ""I carry with me expectations, people think they know me, and actually they don't, they know Matt Hancock from the TV and the media.
""I just went in absolutely clear that I was going to be totally myself as if their cameras weren't on and that's what I did. And that is what I'm like in private.""
Sunday's final was watched by an average of 10.1 million viewers, according to overnight viewing figures from ratings body Barb.
Figures from ITV show 47% of public votes went to Scott, 31% to Warner and 22% to Hancock. After Hancock was eliminated, Scott won with 58% to Warner's 42%.
However, Hancock's triumph in reaching the final did not impress some fellow politicians. Business Secretary Grant Shapps said Hancock's political career was ""pretty much done"" after appearing on the show.
He said on Times Radio: ""I do think... that his true position should have been in Parliament this last few weeks, and serving his constituents.
""You know, it's often said that... politics is showbusiness for ugly people. He should be with us uglies back in the House rather than the jungle down under.""
Hancock took part in 10 Bushtucker trials during his time in the jungle, five of which were the result of a public vote.
Since last week, the public have been voting to keep their favourite campmates in the jungle, rather than to evict their least favourites. 
During his exit interview, Hancock admitted he was nervous about taking part in the series, adding that he had expected the tough questions he was asked by other campmates.
""Some of those grillings were really enjoyable and a release, because I could say exactly what I thought, and some were very emotional about some parts of my past that everybody knows about,"" he said.
""We had really grown-up conversations about it, and there were strong feelings but there wasn't any aggro, they were discussions.""
He concluded: ""I know it was controversial, me coming in here... but we've all got lots of sides to our personalities.""
After his interview, Hancock was seen being reunited with his partner Gina Coladangelo, who he was caught kissing on CCTV in 2021 - events which ultimately led to his resignation as health secretary.
Social distancing guidelines, which Hancock had helped devise, were in place at the time they were pictured kissing. He faced a barrage of criticism when the footage was released by the Sun.
Hancock's participation in the series was criticised by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who said Hancock should not be away from his constituents while Parliament is sitting.
44-year-old was also criticised by Conservative colleagues and opposition MPs, as well as his local Conservative association who said they were ""disappointed"" and accused Hancock of a ""serious error of judgement"". 
Soon after the MP's arrival in the camp on 9 November, a banner was flown over it bearing a message from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group.
But Hancock, who said he entered the jungle to raise awareness of his dyslexia campaign, survived all the public-voted evictions during his time on the show.
Hancock previously said he would donate some of his fee for taking part in the series - reported to be £400,000 - to a hospice in his constituency and dyslexia charities.
Asked how she felt to be crowned Queen of the Jungle, Scott joked: ""I just can't believe it, I think I'm going to owe my grandma a lot of money for 12 million votes."" 
She described her fellow campmates as ""absolutely incredible"".
""We were one big team,"" she continued. ""I don't think there should be one winner, we couldn't have got through it without all of us, I think we've all been winners of I'm A Celebrity.""
Scott's friends from the sporting world were quick to congratulate her online.
Former England rugby player Rochelle ""Rocky"" Clark wrote on Twitter: ""Couldn't (have) been a better choice. The people's choice.""
Former England footballer Fara Williams agreed as she said it was ""never in doubt"", adding: ""Queen of the jungle so proud of you... you absolutely smashed it.""
Retired footballer Fern Whelan also shared her delight at Scott's triumph as she wrote on Twitter: ""SO PROUD OF YOU!""
And actor and last year's jungle champion Danny Miller added he was delighted to pass on the throne to Scott as he posted she was a ""deserved winner"", adding: ""A pleasure to hand over the crown to you! Enjoy it!""
Hollyoaks star Warner, who came second, said he was ""so gassed"" about Scott's win. ""I think everyone agrees, no-one deserves it more than Jill,"" he said.
Earlier in Sunday's final, Scott, Hancock and Warner were seen taking part in their last Bushtucker trials, before enjoying their final meal together in camp.
Hancock's trial, Flood Your Face, saw him have his head placed in a tank of water, while wearing a snorkel to breathe, for five minutes. Various critters were added around his face, including eels, yabbies and water spiders.
I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! is one of ITV's biggest hits, running for three weeks every November. It has regularly attracted eight million viewers throughout this series.
ITV News presenter Charlene White, A Place In The Sun host Scarlette Douglas, Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver and singer Boy George were among this year's campmates.
Other contestants included comedians Babatunde Aléshé and Seann Walsh, radio DJ Chris Moyles, and former rugby player Mike Tindall."	/news/entertainment-arts-63634455

rk is located at Springfield Village, Springfield University Hospital's 81-acre development in Tooting.
When complete, it will have two mental health facilities, 800 homes, a care home, a new school and a host of other facilities.  
It will be the biggest new park to open in London since the Olympic Village in Stratford.
rk will boast a pavilion café, an amphitheatre, gardens, children's playgrounds, ponds, a youth shelter and areas for ball games.
So far, 700 trees have been planted on the site ready for its opening in the spring, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reports.
South West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust said the first mental health facility would open next month and the second in the new year.
Phillip Murray, director of finance and performance at the trust, said the hospital would be ""very much at the centre"" of the development as part of efforts to destigmatise mental health. 
He told Wandsworth Council's health committee that the new facilities would be among the best in the country.
He added: ""What we are rather hoping is that the new hospital that we're building will encourage more staff to want to work with us - being that it will be the newest and most modern mental health facilities in the country.""
rk is expected to open to the public in three phases between next year and the summer of 2025.

entertainment	Terry Hall was diagnosed with cancer before his death, his bandmate reveals	"Specials' frontman Terry Hall had been diagnosed with cancer shortly before his death this week at the age of 63, his bandmate has confirmed.
Bassist Horace Panter gave a moving account of his friend's final days revealing they had planned to record a new album in November before Hall was taken ill with a suspected stomach bug.
It later transpired to be pancreatic cancer, which had spread to his liver.
Initial treatment went well, but Hall began to fade in December, Panter said.
""Reports are not good,"" he wrote. ""Terry has lost a lot of weight and is very frail. 
""His friend Ian Broudie [of The Lightning Seeds] visits and phones manager Steve. He fears that Terry is slipping away.""
He continued: ""15th December and manager Steve drives up to London to visit. He calls me on his return journey and says things are not looking promising. Terry is dying. The next day he is put on morphine and is more-or-less unconscious for most of the time.""
Panter said he had planned to visit his friend in hospital, but was advised not to by Hall's wife Lindy, who arranged a phone call to say goodbye. 
""It was tough,"" Panter said. ""Terry died around half past five the next evening, Sunday 18th December.
""The world has lost a unique voice and I have lost a good friend.""
Speaking on LBC, Barry Ashworth, frontman of Dub Pistols, added that Hall's last words had been ""Love, love, love"" - the same phrase he often used to close shows.
""Never forget it,"" Ashworth told presenter Andrew Marr, adding: ""I've lost one of my heroes, but I've lost one of my dearest, dearest, dearest friends.""
ributes to Hall, who also fronted bands including Fun Boy Three and The Colourfield, poured in from across the music world on Tuesday, with friends and colleagues remembering his warmth and dry humour, as much as his music.
Pogues frontman MacGowan wrote that he was ""really [expletive] sad to hear about Terry Hall"", adding: ""He was a great guy and I am praying for his family and friends @thespecials.""
Stone Roses singer Ian Brown called the musician ""a musical pioneer, a true original, one of the great frontmen, an inspiration and a lovely fella"".
Blur's Damon Albarn, who has often described Hall as an inspiration, posted a moving piano cover of The Specials' Friday Night, Sunday Morning to social media, accompanied by the caption: ""Terry, you meant the world to me. I love you.""
Madness, who were also at the forefront of the 80s ska movement, shared a black and white picture of Hall on Twitter, writing: ""A terrible loss to all of us, way too young, RIP Terry Hall.""
And Billy Bragg recalled: ""The Specials were a celebration of how British culture was invigorated by Caribbean immigration but the onstage demeanour of their lead singer was a reminder that they were in the serious business of challenging our perception of who we were in the late 1970s.""
Specials were formed in Hall's home city of Coventry in 1977 by Jerry Dammers, Lynval Golding and Horace Panter - with Hall, Neville Staple, Roddy Byers and John Bradbury joining a year later.

politics	Rishi Sunak: How the US shaped Britain's new leader	"UK's new prime minister points to his time in the US studying and working as a defining part of his life. So what are Rishi Sunak's American connections?
42-year-old has made the California chapter of his biography a key part of his public persona.
He frequently cites his time there in his 20s and early 30s to burnish his credentials as a business-savvy leader.
""I have lived and worked in California and I actually think it's one of the reasons that I would be good at this job,"" he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg last month while running for the Conservative leadership.
""Because what I will bring to this job is a way of thinking that is different. When we think about growth and in a modern economy, how do you drive growth - you drive it through innovation. Because of my experience I know how to build that type of economy.""  
Here's a closer look at this period which had such an impact on him.
Mr Sunak started his years in America at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business as a Fulbright Scholar, heading to Silicon Valley in 2004 as the internet boom was under way.
rogramme, which admits roughly 400 students per year, has a reputation as the most exclusive business degree in the country.
Among the classes Mr Sunak took was ""The Paths to Power"", intended to help students understand power and how to wield it effectively.
He did not earn any particular academic distinctions and his professor in that class was unable to recollect him - understandably, given he taught 100 students a year.
But a more life-changing landmark in those early US years occurred when he met his wife, Akshata Murty, daughter of the founder of Indian tech firm Infosys.
Classmates at the time have told biographer Michael Ashcroft that they were a ""power couple"" on campus.
Derrick Bolton, who was assistant dean of admissions from 2001-2016 and remains friendly with the couple, said Mr Sunak entered the programme ""very self-assured"". 
""He knew from a young age that he wanted to make an impact on as many people as possible.""
Earlier this summer the couple invited Mr Bolton to Downing Street for tea, where they lived in Mr Sunak's capacity as chancellor. They showed their visitor exhibits on former chancellors and served biscuits marking the Queen's Jubilee.
Mr Bolton, who attended their New York wedding celebration in 2009, said he was surprised they made the time.
""Despite the lofty titles and significant responsibility, they are the same two lovely people they were as students - open and kind and humble and remarkably self-effacing,"" he said. ""They're very low-key, very chill.""
After graduating, Mr Sunak took a lucrative job at the London-based hedge fund, TCI Fund Management.
Mr Sunak focused on the US, participating in the firm's bitter 2008 fight with the leaders of America's CSX freight railroad.
Lawyer Marc Weingarten, who worked closely with Mr Sunak at this point, said he stood out as a ""sponge for information"".
""He was all over it,"" he said. ""They [Mr Sunak and his boss] had studied the industry and CSX in depth for months and their mastery of the industry and CSX was astonishing.""
In 2009, in the wake of the financial crisis, top leaders at TCI left to start their own firm Theleme and took Mr Sunak with them.
He became part of a team of two based in Santa Monica, a beach-side city just outside Los Angeles, and famous as the home of celebrities such as David Beckham and Christian Bale.
He invested in companies such as Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and started to put down ties to the area, joining the board of local Boys & Girls Club, a charity which runs after-school programmes and other activities for needy children.
Aaron Young, who led the organisation at the time, said he was surprised to see Mr Sunak become prime minister but that his ambition was always evident.
""I think he always had aspirations,"" Mr Young said.
Mr Sunak ultimately left the US, won a seat in the UK Parliament in 2015 and started his rapid ascent in British politics. But his California years have remained a frequent touchstone.
He has said he tried to introduce a ""start-up"" mentality while leading the Treasury Department, and credited Stanford for pushing him to shed ""incremental"" ways of thinking. 
rs in the US also informed his decision to back Brexit, he told the BBC in 2019.
""The pace of change is just accelerating around the world - that was my experience being in California,"" he said. ""My general broad view was given the pace of change... being independent and having the flexibility and nimbleness to react would be of enormous value to us.""
More on Rishi Sunak and his family
Mr Sunak and his wife continue to maintain a flat in Santa Monica, which they regularly visit. But his ties to the US have at times caused an outcry.
r, it emerged he had retained his Green Card, giving him the right to live and work in the US as a permanent resident. He returned it in October last year, ahead of his first American trip as a government minister.
ure occurred around the time it was revealed his wife held non-domiciled status, meaning she did not have to pay tax on earnings from outside the UK.
roversies have been used to raise questions about Mr Sunak's commitment to the country, despite his being born and raised in the UK, said Victoria Honeyman, professor of British politics at the University of Leeds. 
""There are legitimate questions - if you are chancellor of the exchequer, should your wife have non-dom status? Should you own a green card? The problem is that it gets tied up with a lot of issues that are not necessarily valid,"" she said, adding: ""I'm not sure a white politician would have to make those kinds of justifications to the same degree.""
But such controversies are low-level compared to the economic and political crisis he now faces as prime minister, said Rod Dacombe, director of the Centre for British Politics and Government at King's College London. 
""The thing that's going to make or break him isn't the kind of story that he presents or his ties to America.
""It's going to be how he deals with the almost impossible economic situation that he's going to face,"" he said. ""Is it going to be fixed in time for the next election? Probably not."""	/news/world-us-canada-63402491
business	Finland wants to transform how we make clothes	"Petri Alava used to wear pressed suits and leather shoes to work, managing large corporations selling everything from magazines to gardening equipment.
Now he runs a Finnish start-up where socks are the norm on the office floor, and he proudly sports a round-neck T-shirt spun from recycled clothing fibres, tucked into some baggy shorts.
His firm, Infinited Fiber, has invested heavily in a technology which can transform textiles that would otherwise be burned or sent to landfills, into a new clothing fibre.
Called Infinna, the fibre is already being used by global brands including Patagonia, H&M and Inditex, which owns Zara. ""It's a premium quality textile fibre, which looks and feels natural - like cotton,"" says Mr Alava, rubbing his own navy blue tee between his fingers. ""And it is solving a major waste problem.""
Around the world, an estimated 92 million tonnes of textiles waste is created each year, according to non-profit Global Fashion Agenda, and this figure is set to rise to more than 134 million tonnes by 2030, if clothing production continues along its current track.
untrained eye, samples of Infinited Fiber's recycled fibre resemble lambswool; soft, fluffy and cream coloured. Mr Alava explains that the product is produced through a complex, multi-step process which starts with shredding old textiles and removing synthetic materials and dyes, and ends with a new fibre, regenerated from extracted cellulose.
finished fibre can then simply ""hop into the traditional production processes"" used by High Street brands, replacing cotton and synthetic fibres, to produce everything from shirts and dresses to denim jeans.
Much of the science involved in making the fibre has been around since the 1980s, says Mr Alava, but rapid technological advancements in the last few years have finally made large-scale production a more realistic possibility.
In parallel, he believes High Street brands have become more focused on ""really honestly looking for changing their material usage"", while millennial and Gen Z consumers are increasingly concerned about shopping sustainably. ""They are different animals, different consumers, to people my age,"" he laughs.
mpany has already attracted so much interest in its technology that it recently announced it was investing €400m (£345m; $400m) to build its first commercial-scale factory at a disused paper mill in Lapland.
goal is to produce 30,000 tonnes of fibre a year once it's operating at full capacity in 2025. That is equivalent to the fibre needed for approximately 100 million T-shirts.
""I think the impact could be quite big, if you think about the whole textile system, what exists currently and how much textile waste that we have,"" argues Kirsi Niinimäki, an associate professor in fashion research at Aalto University, a few blocks away from Infinited Fiber's headquarters. 
""It's a really good example of actually how we can 'close the loop'… really begin to move to a circular economy.""

Infinited Fiber's growth is tied into a wider vision in Finland, which wants to become Europe's leading circular economy, with a focus on reusing and saving resources. In 2016, it became the first government in the world to create a national road map designed to help reach its goal.
Several other Finnish start-ups are looking at ways to produce new textile fibres on a big scale, while also cutting down on harmful emissions and chemicals. These include Spinnova which, from its textiles factory in Jyväskylä, central Finland, transforms cellulose from raw wood pulp into ready-to-spin fibres.
It has partnered up with Suzano, one of the world's leading pulp producers, headquartered in Brazil. And, the company says its spinning technologies can even be used to create new fibres from a range of other materials that can be turned into pulp, from wheat straw to leather offcuts.
""Of course, the volumes are tiny at the moment, [but] our plan together with Suzano is that in the next 10 years we are going to upscale up to one million tonnes in annual volume,"" says Janne Poranen, one of Spinnova's co-founders.
He is less specific about how exactly that is going to happen, though, refusing to give any financial projections and admitting that the company has yet to decide which continent its first large-scale production plants outside Finland are likely to be built on. 
Still, Spinnova's yarn is attracting plenty of global attention and has so far been used by brands including upmarket Finnish clothing label Marimekko, and outdoor wear firms North Face, Bergans and Adidas, which recently used it in a limited edition midlayer hoodie designed for hikers.
Mr Poranen has big ambitions for Spinnova-woven products, hoping they can gain a reputation for being sustainable and long-lasting, in a similar way to how Gor-Tex became a household name for its waterproof technologies.
Elsewhere in Europe, there are a range of other companies developing technologies to create more circular yarns, including Swedish startup Renewcell, and Bright.fiber Textiles, which plans to open its first factory in the Netherlands in 2023.
But experts say there are a range of challenges facing these new fibre brands as they plot their expansions. 
Ms Niinimäki underlines that the clothing manufacturing sector has, until recently, been slower than many other industries when it comes to embracing sustainability, which could set the tone for a slower transformation than companies like Spinnova and Infinited Fiber hope.
""It has been so easy to produce the way that we have been producing, and just to move towards more effective industrial manufacturing on an increasingly bigger scale,"" she says.
""There hasn't been a big pressure to change the already existing system."" However, she is hopeful that, in the European Union at least, new rules aimed at ensuring clothing manufacturers focus on more sustainable and durable products will speed up ""a change in mindsets"".
Another issue is whether clothing brands will be able to pass on the additional costs of their new high-tech production techniques on to consumers, especially at a time when the cost of living is spiralling globally.
Adidas' latest limited edition hoodie produced with Spinnova fabric costs €160 (£137; $160) to buy online in Finland, at least €40 more than most of its other technical hoodies.
""Fashion is a complicated area, because even if people are saying that they are environmentally aware, they don't always act rationally,"" says Ms Niinimäki. ""There's also this kind of emotional side when you talk about fashion consumption, and of course, the price is also linked to that.""
While both Infinited Fiber and Spinnova insist their business plans look holistically at all aspects of production - for example using renewable technologies to power their factories - climate campaigners argue it is still too early to accurately estimate the net effect of these new techniques on carbon emissions.
""Pulp and other alternative fibres can provide diversity for sourcing textile materials and therefore lessen the burden caused by production of more traditional textile raw materials such as cotton,"" says Mai Suominen, a leading forest expert for WWF. ""However it depends on the use of energy, all the processes they use and how they use waste materials."" 
Most importantly, she argues, simply slotting more sustainable fibres into the multibillion dollar fashion industry won't be enough to combat climate change, if we keep making and buying clothes at the current rate. 
""There is no sustainable development unless the overall natural resource consumption is radically decreased to a level that fits within planetary boundaries,"" she argues. 
But within the Finnish fibres industry there is a sense of boomtown optimism that the increased use of recycled or reimagined fibres could be an important part of the jigsaw in the battle to limit climate change. 
""The fast-fashion companies who have been kind of creating certain parts of the problem are highly interested in new technologies,"" says Infinited Fibers chief executive Petri Alva. He believes that if investment continues, the recycled fibres could become mainstream within ten to 15 years. "	/news/business-62806565
technology	Twitter UK staff get deadline over cuts consultation	"witter staff in the UK who face losing their jobs have been given three days to nominate someone to represent them in a formal consultation about their employment.
Under UK employment law a consultation has to be carried out before redundancies can be made.
An email seen by the BBC from Twitter's European HR department says they have until 0900 Tuesday to decide who to put forward, and was sent on Friday night.
Staff can nominate themselves.
If there are more than 10 nominations, an election will be held, the email said, although there were no details offered as to how this would be organised.
It comes after Elon Musk, the company's new owner, said he had ""no choice"" but to cut 50% of Twitter's staff worldwide.
Mr Musk said the firm he bought for $44bn at the end of October is currently losing around $4m per day.
first Twitter layoffs were announced one day after Mr Musk bought the company.
CEO Parag Agrawal was among the workers who received their notice, with around half of Twitter's 7,500 staff expected to be cut. 
Following the announcement, the workers union Prospect said it now has ""dozens"" of Twitter UK staff members on its books.
If more than 100 people in the UK are affected by a firm's job cuts then there must be a 45-day consultation before any redundancies can be made, it added.
A senior official told the BBC three days was a very short time frame for people to organise themselves or communicate with each other, especially given that most still have frozen access to company-wide work platforms such as the messaging service Slack and their Twitter email accounts.
Seven days was considered a ""reasonable"" period of time for this to take place, she said, although there is no official rule. 
Mr Musk first announced he wanted to buy Twitter for $44bn in April - but it took a long and tumultuous six months for a deal to be struck. 
In July, the tech billionaire said he had pulled out of the sale because he had not been given enough information on how many real, active Twitter users there were.
witter responded by taking Mr Musk to court so that he would honour the sale.
urt case was then stalled when Mr Musk announced that he had bought the platform for $44bn at the end of October.
re is uncertainty over Mr Musk's plans for the platform's future. Online safety groups and campaigners have expressed concerns about his plans to relax content moderation and reverse permanent Twitter bans given to controversial figures, including former US president Donald Trump.
He also sparked criticism for suggesting that verified Twitter users pay $8 (£7) a month for their blue ticks."	/news/technology-63527336
business	US stocks see worst first half drop in more than 50 years	"US stocks have seen their worst first half of a year since 1970, as concerns grow over how steps to curb inflation will affect economic growth.
In the last six months, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 20.6%, while other major US indexes also dropped sharply.
Stocks in the UK, mainland Europe and Asia have also suffered steep losses.
It comes as central banks around the world are trying to rein in soaring living costs, with prices of essential goods like food and fuel jumping.
Some economists expect the US, which is the world's biggest economy, to go into a recession as early as this year as interest rates continue to rise.
""If the US Federal Reserve continues hiking rates the stock market will react quite negatively,"" Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, told the BBC.
Shane Oliver at AMP Capital said: ""Shares are likely to see continued short-term volatility as central banks continue to tighten to combat high inflation, the war in Ukraine continues and fears of recession remain high.""
Another major US stock index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell by more than 15% in the first half of this year, the biggest drop for the period since 1962.
At the same time the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite lost almost 30%, marking its largest percentage drop for the first half of a year.
Major stock market indexes outside the US have also fallen sharply this year.
UK's FTSE 250 has dropped by more than 20%, while Europe's Stoxx 600 index has slipped by almost 17% and the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific markets has fallen by more than 18%.
It comes as many of the world's biggest central banks take steps to slow the rising cost of living, including raising interest rates.
Earlier this week, the bosses of three of the world's biggest central banks warned that the era of moderate inflation and low interest rates had ended.
At an annual meeting in Portugal, the heads of the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England said action must be taken quickly to prevent price rises from getting out of control.
However, they also cautioned that measures to rein in an inflation shock caused by the Ukraine war and pandemic may have a significant negative impact on global growth.
""Is there a risk that we would go too far? Certainly there's a risk, but I wouldn't agree that it's the biggest risk to the economy,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said.
""The bigger mistake to make, let's put it that way, would be to fail to restore price stability,"" he added.
Last month, the Fed announced its biggest rate rise in nearly 30 years as it ramped up its fight to rein in soaring consumer prices.
Bank of England also raised its key interest rate to the highest level in 13 years, from 1% to 1.25%.

health	Lisnaskea: At-risk GP practice operators 'committed to community'	"managers of an at-risk GP practice in County Fermanagh have reassured staff and patients that they remain ""committed to the community"".
Maple Healthcare in Lisnaskea is one of Northern Ireland's largest GP practices.
managers have handed their contract back to the Department of Health, meaning the practice requires a change in how it operates or who operates it.
It will continue seeing patients as normal for the next six months.
Department of Health has said it will start a recruitment process to find new operators for the practice.
umber of partners at Maple Healthcare has reduced over the past 18 months, while another is due to retire in early 2023. 
It is understood one option would be for the Western Trust to take on the management of the practice. 
In recent years, the surgery had stepped in to provide services when neighbouring GPs retired. 
Maple Healthcare taking over the patients of three practices in Roslea, Newtownbutler and Lisnaskea.
In a statement, the management of Maple Healthcare said media reports over the weekend of the practice's potential closure had caused ""anxiety and uncertainty"".
""We would like to reassure all our staff and patients that we are continuing to provide GP care and services and we remain committed to the community in Lisnaskea, Newtownbutler and Roslea,"" they said.
ment added the changes in partners and a ""failure to recruit sufficient new partners"" led to management exploring with the department how ""GP services can continue to be delivered locally over the years ahead"".
ment said that the partners at the practice wanted to be released from administrative tasks to have ""more time to devote to patient care"".
""We would like to clarify that rather than a 'change in management' which was erroneously reported over the weekend, what we seek is a change in employment and contractor status,"" the statement added.
It added that the partners intend to continue to work in Lisnaskea and Newtownbuter and continue to deliver services.
""We hope that whatever agreement is reached with the department, it will safeguard GP services within our community for the foreseeable future,"" it said.
ment went on to say that the transfer of ownership is expected to take six months and that patients were urged to stay with the practice ""as we intend to provide a seamless transfer to a new provider"".
In their letter to the Department of Health, the partners cited ""excessive stresses and intolerable pressures"" at work as some of the reasons for handing back the contract. 
""The remaining partners find it inconceivable that they could continue to carry the burden of responsibility of running the practice,"" they added.
w came days after the Western Trust confirmed plans to temporarily remove emergency surgery services from the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen. 
On Saturday, Dr Alan Stout, co-chairman of the British Medical Association GP committee, said there was a well-known problem with recruiting new GPs in the area.
He also said nine GP services across Northern Ireland had either handed back their contract or were in the process of doing so and warned of more following suit."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63709375
politics	Labour gets ball rolling on its plan to reshape UK	"Let's be honest: when politicians talk about the structures of government - how politics works, or doesn't - it doesn't set many hearts racing. 
I must admit to the odd flutter, but then I am paid to be a bit weird about this stuff. 
It isn't punter-friendly, retail politics.
What really matters are outcomes, rather than processes. 
Labour's bet is that things won't improve without a re-wiring of who takes decisions and where. 
Or, to put it another way, better processes, as they see them, will lead to better outcomes, they hope. 
But how much of this will they deliver if they win? 
't absolutely committed to any of it yet; that will wait for their programme for government, their manifesto, a few weeks before the next general election. 
Senior figures tell me Keir Starmer does believe in everything in Gordon Brown's weighty and lengthy treatise — he would have insisted on anything he didn't like going in the bin before the document saw the light of day.
On the face of it, you might wonder what connects the House of Lords, the future integrity or otherwise of the United Kingdom and communities that feel left behind.
Labour's thesis is that a perceived lack of political influence in all sorts of spots around the UK, away from the south east of England, drove many people to back Brexit and many in Scotland to back independence. 
Perhaps, but then plenty were motivated by a more straightforward belief in the propositions they endorsed in those referendums. 
Labour is also arguing such a centralised political system reinforces a sense of dislocation, irritation and economic under-performance. 
Perhaps, but governments for around a century have sought to address the inequalities of geography in the UK, with at best limited success. 
And there isn't likely to be much extra new money about for a Labour government to give all this a kickstart, if indeed they concluded money would make an important difference. 
Conservatives argue this all amounts to navel-gazing and they've done plenty of devolution themselves — handing power away from Westminster.
And the Scottish National Party reckon Labour's idea of giving more power to the Scottish government and parliament are underwhelming and reheated. 
re's the issue of what, in the end, Labour chooses to focus on. 
govern, or aspire to govern, is to prioritise —and an incoming government, of whatever complexion, will inherit one heck of an in-tray.
""It's not the first one hundred days stuff, this,"" as one party source acknowledged. 
But the announcements reveal a willingness for Labour to embark on a wholesome conversation beyond immediate short-term political horizons, in the hope a roadworthy set of ideas emerges for it to attempt to deliver.
And that, in itself, is indicative of a confidence, borne of opinion polls that now suggest Labour can win the next election. 
A criticism that has dogged the Labour leader has been that few people know what he stands for. 
Sir Keir Starmer is beginning - at last, some say - and albeit in rather general terms, to paint the broad canvas of his vision for a Labour government. 
He knows the demand for detail will soon grow, as will the scrutiny."	/news/uk-politics-63867587
entertainment	Queen premiere previously unheard Freddie Mercury song Face It Alone	"Queen have revealed a previously unheard, deeply emotional song they recorded with Freddie Mercury in 1988.
Face It Alone, which the late singer recorded during sessions for 1989 album The Miracle, was given its premiere by BBC Radio 2's Ken Bruce on Thursday.
""We did find a little gem from Freddie, that we'd kind of forgotten about,"" drummer Roger Taylor said about the track in June.
""It's wonderful, a real discovery. It's a very passionate piece.""
g is one of six unreleased tracks to feature in a forthcoming box set of The Miracle, four of which feature Mercury's vocals.
A slow, sombre ballad, Face It Alone opens with a pounding drum and a finger-picked guitar line, before Mercury sings: ""When something so near and dear to life / Explodes inside / You feel your soul is set on fire.""
It was recorded during the historic sessions for The Miracle in London and Switzerland, when Mercury had been diagnosed with HIV but hadn't made it public.
In a powerful vocal, he appears to reference his failing health, growing increasingly passionate as he repeats the refrain: ""In the end / You have to face it all alone.""
Guitarist Brian May originally thought the recording was unsalvageable, but engineers proved him wrong. 
""It was kind of hiding in plain sight,"" he told Radio 2's Zoe Ball earlier this year. 
""We looked at it many times and thought, oh no, we can't really rescue that. But in fact, we went in there again and our wonderful engineering team went, 'OK, we can do this and this.' 
""It's like kind of stitching bits together... but it's beautiful, it's touching.""
One of more than 20 off-cuts from the sessions, Face It Alone is much darker than tracks like I Want It All and The Invisible Man, which eventually made it on to The Miracle.
um's closing track Was It All Worth It, however, dealt with similar themes, as the star reflected on his life and career and asked: ""Am I a happy man / Or is this sinking sand?""
Mercury died in November 1991, nine months after Queen's final album Innuendo - the successor to The Miracle - was released.
urviving group members reconvened in 1995 to record Made In Heaven, completing songs the singer had recorded before his death.
""new"" Queen music featuring Mercury's vocals came out eight years ago, when May and Taylor included the Michael Jackson duet There Must Be More to Life Than This on the 2014 Queen Forever compilation.
In 2019, a stripped-down version of Mercury's 1986 solo single Time was also released under the title Time Waits for No One.
Since 2011, the band have toured with American Idol star Adam Lambert, selling out stadiums across the world. Their 1981 Greatest Hits album is the UK's best-selling album of all time, with more than seven million copies sold.
Face It Alone is being released as a single on Thursday, with the Miracle box set following on 18 November. 
ght-disc collection will feature alternative takes and demos, alongside radio interviews and fly-on-the-wall recordings from the album sessions.
r unreleased tracks are When Love Breaks Up, You Know You Belong To Me, Dog With a Bone, Water and fan favourite I Guess We're Falling Out.
Several of those have circulated on bootlegs over the last 30 years, but this marks their first official release.

sports	Courtney Tulloch: World medallist predicts Team GB will 'smash it' at Paris 2024	"World gymnastics bronze medallist Courtney Tulloch has predicted that Team GB will ""absolutely smash it"" at the Paris Olympics in 2024.
finished fourth in the medal table with six podiums at the recent World Championships in Liverpool.
ulloch, 27, claimed the first medal in the rings by a British gymnast after earlier taking a team-event bronze.
French capital is set to stage the Olympics for the third time, 100 years on from last doing so in 1924.
And the British men and women's gymnastics teams have already qualified to compete.
""It takes a lot of pressure off, so now we can start building and focusing on what we want to do in Paris, whether it's the routines, the team selection,"" Tulloch told BBC Essex. 
""I think if we carry on the way we are, we're going to absolutely smash it out in Paris. We've got a lot of work to do before then but it's looking really good.""
He continued: ""For us, it's just amazing that so many people are watching our sport on TV, supporting and getting behind us. We've come such a long way in such a small amount of time and we just want as many eyeballs on our sport as possible.""
ulloch's medals in Liverpool capped a highly successful year which saw him retain his Commonwealth rings title as well as collecting team golds in Birmingham and at the European Championships in Munich - the latter despite a nut allergy reaction the previous night.
""We started off pretty slow in that team final and we had a few mistakes on pommel but for us to come together as a collective, put that behind us and finish with a bronze was just incredible,"" said Tulloch, who first took up the sport aged six and trains in Basildon.
""I was heartbroken watching it because teams don't normally come back from being eighth. The scores on pommel were very low and I hadn't even competed yet.
""But I knew if I went [well] on rings, and that we're a very strong team on vault and parallel bar, so if we could score well on those apparatus we could bring ourselves back.
""It wasn't a time for talking and chatting, it was a time to show our personality and show the hard work we'd been putting in in the gym on the apparatus.""   
Great Britain could have three-time Olympic gold medallist Max Whitlock, a pommel horse specialist, back in the squad for Paris following an extended break from the sport.
""He's looking in incredible shape. It will be a massive lift [to have him back] because he's such a calm, cool character and it's good to have someone like that in the team,"" Tulloch added.
""He's so experienced at the same time so you can go to him for anything. It will just lift everyone's game and it's a real positive to have him in there."""	/sport/gymnastics/63582417
business	Eight million Australians urged to turn off lights	"Australia's energy minister has urged households in New South Wales - a state that includes the country's biggest city Sydney - to switch off their lights in the face of an energy crisis.
Chris Bowen says people should not use electricity for two hours every evening if they ""have a choice"".
However, he added he was ""confident"" that blackouts could be avoided.
It comes after Australia's main wholesale electricity market was suspended because of a surge in prices.
Mr Bowen asked people living in New South Wales to conserve as much power as possible.
""If you have a choice about when to run certain items, don't run them from 6 to 8 [in the evening],"" he said during a televised media conference in Canberra.
Australia is one of the world's biggest exporters of coal and liquefied natural gas but has been struggling with a power crisis since last month. Three quarters of the country's electricity is still generated using coal. It has long been accused of not doing enough to cut its emissions by investing in renewables. 
In recent weeks, Australia has felt the impact of disruptions to coal supplies, outages at several coal-fired power plants and soaring global energy prices. 
Flooding earlier this year hit some coal mines in New South Wales and Queensland, while technical issues have cut production at two mines that supply the market's biggest coal-fired station in New South Wales.
Around a quarter of Australia's coal-fired electricity generating capacity is currently out of service due to unexpected outages and scheduled maintenance.
Some electricity producers have seen their costs soar as global coal and gas prices have jumped due to sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, demand for energy has jumped amid a cold snap and as Australia's economy opens up after Covid-19 restrictions were eased.
All of this has helped drive up power prices on the wholesale market to above the A$300 (£173; $210) per megawatt hour price cap set by the market's regulator, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo).
However, that cap was below the cost of production for several generators, who decided to withhold capacity.
On Wednesday, Aemo took the unprecedented step of suspending the market and said it would set prices directly and compensate generators for the shortfall.
It also asked consumers in New South Wales to ""temporarily reduce their energy usage"".
Aemo has not given a timeline on when the suspension would be lifted. It said in a statement, ""The price cap will remain until cumulative wholesale electricity prices fall below the cumulative price threshold.""
""Aemo, as the national power system operator, will continue to monitor the situation and provide further updates should conditions change,"" it added.
On Thursday, Australia's biggest electricity producer AGL Energy said it expected to be able to supply more power to businesses and consumers in the coming days.
It has three units that have been out of service at its coal-fired plant in Bayswater, New South Wales.
re among several planned and unplanned outages that have helped cause the power crisis.
AGL said that one of the units should return to service on Thursday, while another will come back online by Saturday.
Meanwhile, Australia's new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the crisis would be raised at a meeting with state premiers which starts on Thursday.
Lynne Chester, an energy expert from the University of Sydney, told the BBC that policymakers have been aware of the risks of ageing generators for decades.
""The sector's regulators and policy makers have ignored the escalating capacity constraints of aging generation assets, fired by fossil fuels, that dominate the sector,"" Prof Chester said.

Jayden Booroff absconded from the Linden Centre in Chelmsford, Essex, on 23 October 2020.
Patient safety investigator Paul Binyon told Essex Coroner's Court that written care notes showed he was an ""absconding risk and an impulsivity risk"".
Jurors heard this was missing from the SBAR electronic forms used by staff.
Mr Booroff, described as a talented musician, had been sectioned twice at the point he left the Linden Centre's Finchingfield Ward shortly after 19:45 BST.
His body was found near Chelmsford railway station about two hours later.
quest heard he had a history of undiagnosed mental health issues and was being given anti-psychotic medication.
Mr Binyon's serious incident investigation, on behalf of the Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, noted that staff observations of Mr Booroff were reduced two days before his death, from four times per hour to once per hour, which did not follow a ""detailed plan"".
""The heightened level of engagement leading to the incident may have given opportunity to detect behaviours, such as an unusual interest in exit routes, which may have indicated an impending attempt to abscond,"" he said on Thursday.
urt was told a nurse tried to ""grab"" Mr Booroff as he fled the unit, but that she had left her Pinpoint security alarm, used for alerting colleagues, in her car after arriving late to her shift.
report outlined nine similar incidents between 2017 and 2020 where inpatients ""tailgated"" staff out of unclosed doors.
""Lessons learnt had not been completed [on incident forms] leading the investigation to find that risk tolerance had been bound in favour of accepting the inevitability of absconding,"" said Mr Binyon.
""There were missed opportunities to learn from patient safety incidents.""
matron at the time of Mr Booroff's absconding previously told jurors that staff would always discuss what ""they've learnt"" from each incident.
wo-week inquest is due to conclude on Friday.

23-year-old spent five weeks in Wales filming the show earlier this year and was one of the three contestants to make the final.
""To come this far, I'll never forget it,"" said Mr Bell.
""Series one was hands down my favourite thing I've ever watched on TV... so being part of [this] final was enough,"" he said.

entertainment	Anger as newspaper claims Liverpool has no significant culture	"Liverpool City Region's mayor has demanded an apology after an article claimed the city had no cultural facilities of ""any great significance"".
ry in Thursday's Daily Telegraph examined the battle between Liverpool and Glasgow to host next year's Eurovision Song Contest.
Author Ben Lawrence also said Liverpool had ""no art galleries"".
Mayor Steve Rotheram said the comments were ""outrageous"", adding: ""We want a full retraction.""
He asked the journalist to ""set the record straight"", while the city's Walker Art Gallery invited Mr Lawrence for a ""whistle-stop tour"" of the region.
rticle said that, when compared with its Scottish rival, Liverpool ""falls short, with no art galleries, dance companies or opera houses - at least not any that carry any great significance beyond the North West"". 
Mr Lawrence did write that most people would argue Liverpool would come out on top were the awarding of Eurovision hosting duties be given to ""the most culturally significant city"". 
He said: ""No one can write a better melodic line than a Scouser.
""Some of the world's great TV and stage dramatists have also come out of Liverpool.""
However, the arts writer went on to say ""if you are talking about Liverpool as a great city of culture (and it was awarded that title in 2008), a destination for patrons of the arts, the argument starts to fall apart.""
Mr Rotheram said on Twitter: ""Our MPs will be asking questions about this deliberate attempt at misinformation."" 
Using Scouse vernacular, The Walker Art Gallery added: ""There's boss art and culture in every corner of our city.""
Katherine Lloyd, project manager for the John Moores Painting Prize at National Museums Liverpool, described the comment as ""outrageous"" on BBC Radio Merseyside, adding: ""I thought it was very brave to annoy a load of Scousers!""
She said the places mentioned in the Walker Art Gallery thread were ""the tip of the iceberg of the cultural offer in Liverpool"".
""At the Walker, for example, our collection is one of the most important in the UK and we get loan requests from countries around the world including a lot of the countries that will be performing in Eurovision.""
She said Liverpool had many examples of public sculpture, studio groups, street art, festivals and ""little exhibitions popping up in spaces all over the city"". 
will also host the annual Turner Prize ceremony in December.

politics	Menai bridge: Third crossing by 2030 likely - Welsh government	"A third bridge linking Anglesey to the north Wales mainland is ""very likely"", according to the Welsh government.
Plans to build a crossing by 2030 were unveiled in an update on planned infrastructure projects.
Longstanding calls for another bridge were amplified recently after the temporary closure of the Menai Bridge, leaving only one crossing.
In 2018 the Welsh government had previously announced its preferred option for a third route.
was to build a new bridge to the east of Britannia Bridge, and make improvements to Junction 8 and 8A of the A55.
k of the project quietened in recent years, but has now been included in the Welsh government's list of infrastructure projects published on Monday. 
ument states that a third Menai crossing would ""improve safety, journey times and network resilience"".
Welsh government estimates that the project would cost £400m, with a stated intention of starting construction in 2027 and completing it by 2029/30.
Although all projects in the document are said to be ""very likely"" to be carried out, the Welsh government has emphasised that there is no ""formal commitment"" to do so.
""This reflects the possibility of future uncertainties, including the future public spending outlook,"" the document said.
Currently all road building projects have been suspended by the Welsh government while it holds a review to assess their environmental impact.
It added: ""Achieving our decarbonisation targets will be at the heart of decision making for infrastructure developments.""
Plans for a third Menai crossing were welcomed by the Plaid Cymru MS for Ynys Mon, Rhun ap Iorwerth.
""Described as having 'high probability of being delivered', we'll keep pushing to make it,"" he tweeted.
Welsh government's infrastructure document also includes plans for improvements to the A55, A494 and A458 in Flintshire.
Its stated aim is to carry out ""improvement of approximately 7.5 miles (12km) of carriageway between Queensferry and Northop to address traffic congestion, resilience and safety issues in the Deeside area"".
Welsh government said: ""The third Menai crossing will be looked at as part of the roads review, taking into consideration the environmental impact and the affordability of the project in light of the current economic situation."""	/news/uk-wales-63971625
health	Suicide: I'm sleeping rough to fund a new mental health centre	"A man is sleeping rough in a bid to fund a new mental health centre after losing friends to suicide.
Danny Thain, from Fraserburgh, is almost finished his month-long challenge in Aberdeen.
27-year-old father is on the streets until next week with a sign encouraging people to start conversations about mental health. 
He ultimately hopes to raise £3m to open Aberdeenshire's first ""strictly mental health rehabilitation centre"". 
Mr Thain lost three friends to suicide within eight years. 
""The first suicide I ever experienced was when I was 18-years-old,"" he told BBC Scotland.
""I actually carried the coffin of my best friend out of a church, so going through that is really intense.
""The year later I lost another close friend to suicide and another just this summer.""
Mr Thain wants his challenge to encourage people to be more open so they can begin conversations about mental health issues.
He said while he was glad people had opened up, their stories had also taken a personal toll on him.
""I've probably had around 30-plus people who have shared stories with me,"" he said.
""There have been people who have attempted suicide, contemplated suicide, or have experienced suicide and have felt that this is a safe place to come down and actually share their story with me and it's just been absolutely monumental.
""It's a true saying that a counsellor needs a counsellor. I'm obviously listening to everyone's things and hearing these heavy stories but I've not got anyone to hear what I'm saying. So I've been trying to hold back more now and look after myself.""
Mr Thain's World Suicide Prevention Project aims to open a 16-bedroom 300-acre site which would provide professional support. 
""I've got my eyes on an estate,"" he said. ""This is something that's not been done. It's professional in every single aspect of the healing process. It's not a virtual setting and not a waiting list.
""People need help now so we want to do something and provide something that's just going to be absolutely monumental.""
Speaking about sleeping rough in recent weeks, he said: ""In any given day I've got no food, no money, no shelter, no water, I've got to find all those things. That's a mental strain.""
He said he was dealing with rejection from people, having to carry everything around, poor weather and having to find a place to sleep. 
""All those things alone are tough, add homelessness to that as well it's unbelievably tough. So it's very, very draining,"" he said.
Mr Thain's last night sleeping rough is next Wednesday when he will host a sleep-out in Aberdeen's Duthie Park.

technology	Musk says Twitter feud with Apple boss 'resolved'	"Elon Musk has said he and Apple boss Tim Cook have ""resolved the misunderstanding"" over Twitter possibly being removed from the app store.
On Monday, Mr Musk accused Apple of threatening to cut the platform from its app store and said it had halted most of its advertising on the site.
But the Twitter boss tweeted on Wednesday that: ""Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so.""
He did not say if Apple's advertising was discussed at the meeting.
meeting between the two tech leaders comes as many companies have halted spending on Twitter amid concerns about Mr Musk's content moderation plans for the site - a major blow to the company, which relies on such spending for most of its revenue. 
Entering a feud on Monday, Mr Musk accused Apple of ""censorship"" and criticised its policies, including the charge it levies on purchases made on its app store.
""Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?"" he said.
But he later told his followers he was meeting with Mr Cook at Apple's headquarters, adding: ""Good conversation. Among other things, we resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store. Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so.""
News of the meeting with Apple came after Mr Musk was told he faced ""huge work ahead"" to bring Twitter into compliance with new European Union rules on disinformation or face a possible ban.
EU commissioner Thierry Breton made the comments in a meeting with Mr Musk on Wednesday, saying the social media site would have to address issues such as content moderation, disinformation and targeted adverts.
Approved by the EU earlier this year, the Digital Services Act is seen as the biggest overhaul of rules governing online activity in decades, imposing new obligations on companies to prevent abuse of their platforms. 
Major companies are expected to be in compliance with the law some time next year.
If firms are found to be violation, they face fines of up to 6% of global turnover - or a ban in the case of repeated serious breaches.
In a statement after the meeting, Mr Breton said he welcomed Mr Musk's assurances that he would get Twitter ready to comply. 
""Let's also be clear that there is still huge work ahead, as Twitter will have to implement transparent user policies, significantly reinforce content moderation and protect freedom of speech, tackle disinformation with resolve, and limit targeted advertising,"" he said. 
""All of this requires sufficient AI [Artificial Intelligence] and human resources, both in volumes and skills. I look forward to progress in all these areas and we will come to assess Twitter's readiness on site.""
EU plans to conduct a ""stress test"" in 2023 ahead of a wider audit, his office said. 
Since his $44bn takeover of Twitter last month, Mr Musk has fired thousands of staff, reinstated formerly banned users such as Donald Trump and stopped enforcing other policies, such as rules aimed at stopping misleading information on coronavirus.
moves have alarmed some civil rights groups, who have accused the billionaire of taking steps that will increase hate speech, misinformation and abuse.
In a blog post on Wednesday, Twitter said none of its policies had changed, but that it was experimenting in an effort to improve the platform more quickly and would rely more on steps to limit the spread of material that violate its rules - offering ""freedom of speech but not freedom of reach"".
""Our trust & safety team continues its diligent work to keep the platform safe from hateful conduct, abusive behavior, and any violation of Twitter's rules,"" the company added.
""The team remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse,"" it said. "	/news/business-63816110
health	China zero Covid: Violent protests in Guangzhou put curbs under strain	"Crowds of residents in southern China's industrial metropolis Guangzhou have escaped a compulsory lockdown and clashed with police, as anger at strict coronavirus curbs boiled over.
Dramatic footage shows some tearing down Covid control barriers. Riot teams have now been deployed in the area.  
It follows Guangzhou's worst Covid outbreak since the pandemic began.
Amid bad economic figures, China's zero Covid policy is under enormous strain.
uilding in the city's Haizhu District, which is under stay-at-home orders.
rea is home to many poorer itinerant labourers. They have complained of not being paid if they are unable to turn up for work, and of food shortages and skyrocketing prices while living under Covid control measures. 
For several nights, they'd been tussling with the white-clad Covid prevention enforcement officials, and then overnight on Monday the anger suddenly exploded onto the streets of Guangzhou with a mass act of defiance.
Again, unsubstantiated rumours have played a role. Stories have spread that the testing companies are faking PCR results to artificially boost the number of infections in order to make more money.
In the north of the country, the coronavirus rumour mill is also building pressure.
Officials in Hebei Province announced that the city of Shijiazhuang would halt mass testing. But this led to speculation that the population was going to be used, guinea-pig-style, to monitor what would happen if the virus was allowed to spread unchecked. 
Discussion of this has appeared on social media platforms under the hashtag #ShijiazhuangCovidprevention.
Many panicking locals have stockpiled Chinese medicines which are said to help with Covid infection. Supplies in the city are said to have virtually run out for the moment.
A similar viral rumour led to the mass breakout of workers at the Foxconn complex in the central city of Zhengzhou two weeks ago, which has hit the global supply of Apple iPhones.
Local governments across China are struggling to maintain a zero-Covid approach without trashing their economies. The latest official factory output and retails sales figures show the crushing impact of the pandemic and the government's policy response to it.
re are no provinces at all which have reported zero cases in recent days.
Around 20 million people in the heart of western China's mega city of Chongqing have been placed under a type of lockdown being referred to ironically by people as ""voluntary static management"". This is because, though there has been no official announcement, they've been told to remain indoors by community officials. 
Online there have been jokes that the Chongqing government didn't want to announce a mass lockdown on the same day that measures easing zero-Covid rules across China were revealed.
Because Covid amelioration still dominates life here, even a small shift in the way it is being administered can cause consternation and panic.
At the beginning of this week, officials in Beijing's Chaoyang district decided to close many of the street-side testing booths and move them into housing compounds. There was a sudden cut in the number of PCR stations. The problem is that many office buildings require a daily result, or you can't enter. 
So at the booths that were open, the queues were enormous.
From the workers stuck in Tibet who protested to leave Lhasa, to the lockdown of the entire region of Xinjiang, zero-Covid is not going smoothly.
A series of changes announced last week slightly toning down the rules were seen as a sign that more easing was possible down the road. But even if the government is considering this, it may not be soon enough."	/news/world-asia-china-63633109
politics	Gerard Hutch trial: Dowdall denies mass murder plan	"A former Sinn Féin councillor has denied a claim that he discussed mass murder with Gerard Hutch during secretly recorded conversations. 
Jonathan Dowdall described the claim as ""ridiculous"".
Mr Hutch is on trial for murdering 33-year-old David Byrne during a boxing weigh-in at Dublin's Regency Airport Hotel in 2016.
Gardai (Irish police) secretly recorded the pair as they travelled to and from Northern Ireland after the murder.
In the recordings, Mr Hutch can be heard telling Dowdall that ""these three yokes were throwing up either way"" as ""a present"".
rosecution say that is a reference to giving up the three AK47 assault rifles used in the Regency Airport Hotel murder.
Mr Hutch can also be heard saying: ""Twelve months time there's two RUC men dead and them things ballistically traced.""
Dowdall replied the police would then link that to the Regency.
Mr Hutch then says any smart copper would then say it is ""a joint yoke"".
guns were recovered from a vehicle by gardaí (Irish police) near Slane, County Meath, a month after the Regency shooting.
river of that car, Shane Rowan, is currently serving a seven-and-a-half year sentence for possession of firearms and membership of an illegal organisation styling itself as the IRA. 
Dowdall, an electrician, admitted that in the secret recordings he described to Gerard Hutch how to make a bomb.
He said he had never made an explosive device and his comments were based on what he had picked up from movies and television programmes.
He also told the trial that a dissident republican had pressured him to provide circuits for timers for bombs, but he said he never did.
David Byrne's death was the second in the Hutch-Kinahan feud that has claimed 18 lives. 
Dowdall had also been charged with Mr Byrne's killing but in October he pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of facilitating the murder by renting a hotel room for the killers.
He is currently serving a four-year sentence and has applied to join the state's witness protection programme. 
Dowdall previously told the court that Mr Hutch admitted to him that he was one of two men who shot David Byrne dead.
He has accepted there was no corroboration of that.
On Monday, Dowdall told the court Mr Hutch admitted to him at a meeting in a park that he and another person named Nan were the two gunmen who shot Mr Byrne dead.
But in the secretly-recorded garda conversations Mr Hutch said media commentary about who was involved was just speculation.
He also said the six people allegedly involved did not even know each other.
Asked why he did not challenge Mr Hutch on this, Dowdall said Mr Hutch was lying as the Hutch brothers, cousins and friends were involved.
Mr Hutch's barrister asked why would he lie if he had already told Dowdall he did it.
Dowdall replied that Mr Hutch lied because ""I hadn't a clue who was involved.""
Later, Dowdall described as ""horrendous"" a suggestion he made to Mr Hutch about kidnapping Mr Byrne's sister.
In secretly recorded garda interviews, Dowdall told Mr Hutch that Mr Byrne's sister was likely to attend a dancing competition in Ennis, County Clare.
Dowdall said he was sorry for what he was recorded saying.

politics	Gwent Police: Three officers suspended in racist message probe	"ree Gwent Police officers have been suspended after a watchdog launched an investigation into claims of racism, misogyny and homophobia in the force.
It comes after offensive messages were reportedly found on the phone of a retired police officer Ricky Jones, who took his own life in 2020. 
messages were discovered by his family.
Mr Jones's daughter said she was upset after learning of the suspensions via the media.
As well as offensive content, the messages - first reported by the Sunday Times - were said to show evidence of corruption within the force.
Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) said several serving officers were under investigation and it would keep the involvement of other officers under review.
It comes on the same day a Gwent Police officer was sacked for sending inappropriate text messages to three women in a separate case.
wo senior police officers in the same force were also dismissed for gross misconduct following an incident at a social event.
revelations have put pressure on the senior leadership of Gwent Police, including Chief Constable Pam Kelly and Gwent Police and Crime Commissioner Jeff Cuthbert.
IOPC director for Wales Catrin Evans said: ""On the basis of our assessment of the conduct referrals received so far, we have decided that an independent investigation is essential to maintain public confidence.""
Gwent Police said the three officers had been suspended for allegations of misconduct.
family of Mr Jones found the messages after searching his phone for evidence of domestic abuse.
His widow and daughter said he was controlling and abusive at home. 
Mr Jones's daughter said the family was ""upset"" that it was learning the details of the IOPC investigation and suspensions from the media rather than from Gwent Police, Wiltshire Police or the watchdog.
Emma, whose name has been changed, said: ""It's a shame that we've had to go public for this to happen. This should have happened years ago when we raised it originally. 
""I think to myself 'what would have happened if we hadn't made it public? Would any of these officers have been suspended in the end? Would it have just been covered up'?""
She added that the ""family of an abuser"" should not have to go through more pain by making this issue public ""just for the police to do the right thing"".
Sunday Times article reported that WhatsApp and Facebook messages showed Gwent Police officers discussing the sexual harassment of junior female colleagues as well as racism, homophobic and misogynistic abuse, leaking of sensitive police material and corruption.
A subsequent report said veteran police officers joked about Jimmy Savile rescuing the Thai schoolboys who were trapped in a cave and swapped nude pictures of a female footballer.
IOPC said Wiltshire Police would continue to look at Gwent Police's handling of its investigation into Mr Jones's death and officers' contact with relatives.
It said the family would have the right for a review if they were not happy with the outcome. 
family have told BBC Wales they want an independent investigation, rather than other police forces carrying it out.
IOPC decision follows referrals from Gwent Police, which was asked by the watchdog for further information after the messages came to light, and Wiltshire Police.
Gwent had referred several serving and former officers to the IOPC.
Ms Evans said: ""I recognise that many people will find the messages aired in the public domain, apparently shared among police officers, highly disturbing. 
""After publication of the national newspaper article, we formally wrote to the chief constable of Gwent Police requesting they provide us with information to establish the chain of events and decisions taken in relation to the family's complaints, and any conduct matters.""
Gwent Police said it was ""committed to working with"" the IOPC to ensure ""a full and transparent process to tackle any unacceptable behaviour by officers"".
""Following allegations published in The Sunday Times on Sunday 13 and 20 November we have worked to identify the officers involved and to take appropriate action,"" it added.
Sunday Times journalist David Collins told the BBC Walescast podcast: ""The way these investigations work is it won't just end with Ricky Jones's phone.

Quest Pro has mixed reality capabilities, unlike its predecessor - meaning digital content can be viewed overlaid on the real world.
Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said mixed reality was ""the next major step for VR"". 
Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen said the high launch price made it a device more suited to ""high-end, enthusiast and potentially enterprise users"" than mass-market.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also announced that the office platform Windows 365 will be available on it, as Meta seeks to position mixed and virtual reality as a work tool as well as a form of entertainment.
firm Meta, formerly known as Facebook, is betting its future on the creation of a metaverse - a virtual world in which people can both conduct their everyday lives, in the form of avatars, and explore fantasy virtual spaces. 
Many tech firms are building their own metaverses but it is likely to be several years before any exist.
Meta's existing virtual reality world, Horizons, has received mixed reviews so far, and there have been reports of avatars carrying out violence and sexual assault within it. 
Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth has also admitted that ""it will be a while before there are enough headsets out there"".
Paolo Pescatore from PP Foresight said it felt like the tech was being ""fast tracked"" into people's hands. ""There's no demand, why rush,"" he said.

business	Sri Lanka should have gone to IMF sooner, says central bank governor	"Sri Lanka could have avoided its current economic turmoil if it had gone to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout sooner, the country's central bank governor says.
P Nandalal Weerasinghe told BBC Newsnight that the delay in seeking outside help was a mistake.
untry has said it needs $5bn this year in support from the international community, including the IMF.
Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt for the time in its history last month.
""If we had taken the decision to go to the IMF earlier, if we started the debt resettlement process one year before, we could have managed the situation without this kind of suffering in this country,"" he said.
His comments came as he is attempting to restore order to Sri Lanka's economy, which is experiencing extreme fuel shortages, soaring food prices and a lack of medicines.
A recent survey by the United Nations World Food Programme found that around two thirds of Sri Lankan households have been forced to reduce their food intake.
Mr Weerasinghe said Sri Lanka was experiencing its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948.
A team from the IMF is due to arrive in Colombo for talks on Monday and Mr Weerasinghe will be a key participant in those meetings.
Yet there is uncertainty about whether Mr Weerasinghe, who replaced previous governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal in April, will be reappointed for a full six year term at the end of this month.
""I have expressed my desire to continue,"" he said.
""I don't think when I took over I had the expectation I would be serving only for two months and go back. If that was the situation, I would not [have] come in… This is not something that can be addressed within two months. It will get worse before it getting better.""
A complication in the IMF negotiations is Sri Lanka's substantial borrowing from China, which Mr Weerasinghe said accounts for 15% of the country's total external debt.
fund has a policy of not bailing out countries unless all its other creditors have first agreed to write down their loans.
""I'm sure China as a good friend of Sri Lanka [will] offer similar relief that will be offered by other creditors as well,"" said Mr Weerasinghe.
Former Sri Lanka central bank staff have written an open letter to the embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa urging him to keep Mr Weerasinghe in the post.
""If anyone is contemplating to remove him from his position as the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, we see it as a highly unpatriotic move with entirely ulterior motives,"" they wrote.
World Bank has warned that as many as 12 other developing countries are at risk of default over the coming year.
Analysts say states such as the Maldives, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Senegal are also all on the financial brink.
Egypt, Ghana and Pakistan are also seen as intensely vulnerable.

business	Elon Musk puts Twitter deal on hold over fake account details	"Elon Musk has said his $44bn (£35bn) deal to buy Twitter is on hold after he queried the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform.
He said he was waiting for information ""supporting [the] calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users"".
Mr Musk added later that he was ""still committed to [the] acquisition"".
However, analysts speculated he could be seeking to renegotiate the price or even walk away from the takeover.
Mr Musk's tweets sent Twitter's share price plunging 10% in morning trade in New York.
Even before his comments, the company's stock had been selling for less than the $54.20 per share Mr Musk has offered, a sign that the markets were not convinced he would complete the buyout. 
Dan Ives, a tech analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, said Mr Musk's comments would ""send this Twitter circus show into a Friday the 13th horror show"".
""Many will view this as Musk using this Twitter filing/spam accounts as a way to get out of this deal in a vastly changing market,"" he wrote in a note. 
""The nature of Musk creating so much uncertainty in a tweet (and not a filing) is very troubling to us... and now sends this whole deal into a circus show with many questions and no concrete answers as to the path of this deal going forward.""
Mr Musk has been vocal about ""defeating the spam bots"", identifying it as a key goal following his planned takeover of the company.
witter has long faced accusations of not doing enough to address automated, fake accounts posting content. 
In a filing more than two weeks ago, Twitter estimated that fake accounts accounted for fewer than 5% of its daily active users during the first three months of this year. It cautioned that the figures were based on estimates and could be higher.
ms were not different from what the firm had shared in previous disclosures.
umber of spam bots on the service is a key statistic, as a higher than expected figure could hurt the ability to grow advertising revenue or paid-for subscriptions, said Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
But she said it was not clear how genuine Mr Musk's concerns were.
""There will also be questions raised over whether fake accounts are the real reason behind this delaying tactic, given that promoting free speech rather than focusing on wealth creation appeared to be his primary motivation for the takeover,"" she said.
""The $44bn price tag is huge, and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform.""
Weeks of market turmoil in the US have wiped billions off the value of many companies - including once favoured tech firms.
, the electric car company where Mr Musk serves as chief executive, has also seen its shares plunge - a hit to Mr Musk, whose status as the world's richest person is bound up in his stake in the company and who had planned to rely on his shares to help finance the Twitter purchase.
Last month, he raised $8.5bn by selling shares. He also planned to use the shares to secure $6.5bn in loans.
After Mr Musk tweeted that the deal was temporarily on hold, Tesla's share price gained more than 5%.
Another twist in the tale of Elon Musk's attempt to own Twitter.
One of his priorities, he said, was to ""clean up"" the platform - weeding out the bots and spam accounts that he believes drag it down.
Spend any time on it and you'll certainly see evidence of both.
However, Twitter says that less than 5% of its active users are fake.
So does that mean there is no diamond in the rough to be polished here, that what you see on Twitter is what you get after all? And if so, does that make it less valuable a proposition?
It is of course also possible that his new hesitation stems from how he intends to finance the deal - he's already had to sell some of his valuable Tesla stock to raise funds, and that's had an impact on the car firm too.
Mr Musk has some thinking to do.
Mr Musk's latest move comes after an announcement that two Twitter executives are leaving the social media company.
Kayvon Beykpour, who led Twitter's consumer division, and Bruce Falck, who oversaw revenue, both tweeted on Thursday that the departures were not their decisions.
From this week, the firm also said it had paused most hiring, except for ""business critical roles""."	/news/business-61433724
politics	What does the Supreme Court decision mean for indyref2?	"Judges at the Supreme Court have ruled that the Scottish government cannot hold an independence referendum without the UK government's consent.
How could their decision affect the future of the constitutional debate in Scotland?
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hopes to hold a referendum on 19 October 2023, with the SNP and Scottish Greens forming a pro-independence majority in the Scottish Parliament. 
She wants the UK government to do a deal similar to the one ahead of the 2014 referendum, to ensure the result would be legitimate and recognised internationally. 
But successive prime ministers have refused to do so, and the Scottish government instead asked the Supreme Court to rule on whether Holyrood could set up a referendum on its own.
Judges heard two days of arguments in October. Court President Lord Reed - a Scottish judge - announced their decision on Wednesday morning.
re question of the case is whether the draft independence referendum bill drawn up by the Scottish government would ""relate to"" a matter reserved to Westminster, which only MPs can pass laws about.
Scottish government argued that a referendum would be ""advisory"", and would simply seek the views of the people of Scotland on the topic.
It said the vote would have ""no legal consequences"", and that there would still need to be negotiations and legislation at Westminster if a majority of those taking part in the referendum backed independence.
UK government said it was ""perfectly obvious"" that the fate of the union was reserved to Westminster, and that Holyrood does not have the power to hold a referendum on its continued existence.
Its lawyer said a referendum bill would be ""self-evidently, squarely and directly about the Union"", and that it was clear the Scottish government's intention was ""not just to have an opinion poll"".
UK government also previously argued that the judges should throw the case out without making a ruling, saying it would be premature to take a position on a draft bill.
judges ruled unanimously that Scottish government does not have the power to hold an independence referendum without the UK government's consent.
make a judgement - there had been a lot of debate about whether they would come down on either side.
Supreme Court president Lord Reed read the verdict of the justices
judgement underlined the difficulty of the position Lord Advocate Doroth Bain KC was in.
She had to convince the court that this was a weighty issue of constitutional importance, to get them to make a ruling.
But then she had to persuade the judges that a referendum would be of little legal importance.
judges were quick to point out the ""contrast"" between these two lines of argument, and said they were far more convinced by the first point than the second.
greed this was a significant constitutional matter - but that meant Ms Bain's second argument was bound to fail.
UK government argument meanwhile was a simple one - essentially to slap the Scotland Act on the table and say ""it's in black and white"".
me on it in the hearings that it felt like a bit of a gamble. But it's produced an equally simple ruling in their favour.
UK ministers had seemed confident of this result, but it is not the end of the matter as far as the Scottish government is concerned.
ked for years, and they hoped this case would move the matter forward regardless of the result.
Ms Sturgeon had already been clear that she would view a negative result as another roadblock in the path of Scottish democracy.
She hopes the perceived unfairness of being denied a say will prompt a wave of public support - again putting pressure on UK ministers to change their stance. 
She says there are significant questions for UK ministers too about how exactly the issue of independence is ever going to be resolved, given it continues to dominate Scottish politics.
But she knows she will face questions too about how she looks to move forward now - and has doubled down on her plan of turning the next election into a single-issue vote on independence.
re are significant practical issues when it comes to how that would actually work, given the other major parties involved in the vote are unlikely to agree that it constitutes a ""de facto referendum"".
So Ms Sturgeon has sought to push some of those questions down the road a bit, by annoucing a special SNP conference focused on answering them in the new year.
means detailed responses to how the question of independence will be settled are still some way off - as are answers to tricky issues like how an independent Scotland would get back into the EU, which are to feature in a government paper to be published at some unspecified future date.
It all means that after the legal fireworks, the debate is now squarely back in the political realm - and will continue to be as fiercely contested as ever, with no clear ending in sight."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63704822
politics	Nurses are traumatised and fed up, says strike supporter	"Staff shortages and concerns about patient care are the main reasons nurses are backing a strike, a nurse has said.
Leanne Lewis voted in favour of a walkout in the Royal College of Nursing's (RCN) ballot, the results of which are due this week
Ms Lewis, 47, who trained as a nurse in 1995, said: ""I felt we needed to take action. Enough is enough.""
Welsh government called on the UK  government to provide more funding for public sector pay rises.
UK government said it had followed the NHS Pay Review Body's recommendations.
Doctors, consultants, GPs and nurses in Wales have been offered pay rises of between 4% and 5.5%, but inflation hit 10.1% in October, the fastest rate in 42 years, with food costs jumping 14.6% in the year to September.
If the strike goes ahead, it will affect non-urgent but not emergency care.
Friday and final results are being counted, but RCN sources say a large majority of nurses have voted in favour of action in a dispute over pay.
Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast programme, Ms Lewis, who works in a Welsh hospital but did not wish to say which one, said voting to strike was ""an extremely difficult decision"".
""For me, the NHS as a whole throughout the country, they are haemorrhaging staff... staff are leaving in their droves,"" she said.
""There's lots and lots staff sickness, through burnout, complications post-pandemic throughout the hospitals in Wales, ward levels, staff levels, skill mix: there's not the right skills mix on the wards.""
She added that in some cases, staffing levels were ""not safe"". 
""Nurses are absolutely traumatised and fed up of not being able to give the patient care they want to give and that they deserve,"" said Ms Lewis.
""It's heart-breaking to have colleagues phoning me after a shift in tears because they feel they haven't been able to provide the care they wish they could have due to not having the staff.
""Staff are leaving the NHS and they're going back into hospitals working on agency doing exactly the same role for sometimes double, quadruple the amount of wages purely because that's the only way they can make ends meet.""
She added she worked through the pandemic but was currently off work on half pay due to having long Covid.
Ms Lewis said more needed to be done to encourage more people into the profession.
""When I trained I had a small bursary of about £3,500 a year and the actual training was free. Nurses are having to pay now for their training through student loans,"" she explained.
""They're paying their day-to-day bills, travel expenses. There needs to some sort of compromise around pay and staffing numbers.
""The government needs to sit down with the RCA and other unions and have some serious discussions.""
A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We have accepted the independent pay review body's recommendations in full and have been clear that without additional funding from the UK government, there are limits to how far we can go to address these concerns in Wales. 
""We have called on the UK ministers to provide additional funding necessary for fair pay rises for public sector workers and take urgent action now to reduce inflation and provide the help people need during these difficult times.""
UK government said: ""The government has met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in giving its award. It followed a 3% pay rise last year, in recognition of work during the pandemic, despite a public-sector pay freeze."""	/news/uk-wales-63539587
technology	UK set to have world's biggest automated drone superhighway	"UK is set to become home to the world's largest automated drone superhighway within the next two years.
rones will be used on the 164-mile Skyway project connecting towns and cities, including Cambridge and Rugby.
It is part of a £273m funding package for the aerospace sector which will be revealed by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng on Monday.
Other projects include drones delivering mail to the Isles of Scilly and medication across Scotland.
Mr Kwarteng is to announce the news at the Farnborough International Airshow - the first to be held since 2019.
He will say the funding will ""help the sector seize on the enormous opportunities for growth that exist as the world transitions to cleaner forms of flight"".
Dave Pankhurst, director of drones at BT, told the BBC that Skyway is about scaling up trials that have been taking place around the UK.
BT is one of the partners involved in the collaboration.
""This drone capability has existed for quite some time, but is in its infancy in terms of being actually part of our society and being a usable application,"" he said. 
""So for us, this is about taking a significant step towards that point. It's going to open up so many opportunities.""
Skyway aims to connect the airspace above Reading, Oxford, Milton Keynes, Cambridge, Coventry and Rugby by mid-2024, and will receive more than £12m.
A total of £105.5m of the government's funding will be specifically for projects relating to ""integrated aviation systems and new vehicle technologies"", including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones.
rojects include a plan to use drones to provide regular deliveries of mail and medicine to the Isles of Scilly, and to distribute medicines across Scotland, potentially enabling some cancer patients to be treated in their local community.
Chris Forster, chief operating officer of aviation technology company Altitude Angel, said there were a lot of potential uses for the superhighway.
""Whether it be a business doing logistics, all the way to the police and medical deliveries of vaccines and blood samples, there's a real demand to have access to this airspace,"" he said. 
""We've done a few projects in Africa where the road infrastructure was not good for ground vehicles, and the delivery of vaccines was provided by automated drones.""
gy utilises ground-based sensors installed along the highway which provide a real-time view of where drones are in the airspace.
raffic management system - a sort of air traffic control for drones - which guides them along their routes and avoids collisions.
Steve Wright, associate professor in aerospace engineering at UWE Bristol, said the biggest concern regarding crashes does not come when the drone is in the air, but during take-off or landing.
""It's about the first and last bit of the flight,"" he said. ""The problem is what happens when you're 10 feet away from people. That's the bit I spend my time worrying about. 
""When it's up in the air I know it's stable and it's not going to hit something. 
""People are looking at lowering packages down from the air - in other words you keep the drone well away from people. There's lots of very bright people out there working on flight plans that deliberately avoid built-up areas.""
Mr Pankhurst said the project was working alongside the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to ensure safety. 
""The way they work as an organisation is very evidence-based,"" he said. ""Safety is just paramount in this industry, but importantly, nothing happens without the regulator actually signing it off. 
""The CAA is part of all of these future flight projects. It is part of all of these activities, validating the progress and making sure they're safe.""
He said its research showed that people are more likely to accept a drone if they know it is providing an important service.
Simon Jude, senior lecturer at Cranfield University, said: ""People's knowledge and attitudes might change if they know what that UAV is being used for. If it's an emergency medical support, you're probably going to be a lot more accepting of the noise. 
""So what happens if you get multiple UAVs, or an agricultural use where you might get a number of drones collecting and saving data all at once? 
""I live in a rural location, a very quiet location and it might annoy me more than if you were in a city or an urban landscape where there's lots of other noise."" "	/news/technology-62177614
technology	Instagram: Video selfies trial to verify age of teens	"Instagram is exploring new ways for teenagers to verify their age and comply with platform rules.
Meta-owned app is testing video selfies with facial analysis software as a new age-verification method.
Some users on Instagram try to skirt its 13+ age rule by editing their date of birth to make them appear over 18.
But US teens attempting this will now be given three ways to verify age: upload ID, ask three adult users to vouch for them or take a video selfie.
Meta says it hopes the new methods will ensure teens have an ""age-appropriate experience"" on Instagram. 
giant has previously faced criticism over teen and child safety on its platforms. 
Several US states probed Instagram last year over children's experiences on the photo-sharing app, in response to leaks from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen. 
Will Gardner OBE, chief executive of Childnet and director of the UK Safer Internet Centre, says the trial is encouraging: ""The potential is there to try and help protect children from content which isn't for them and make their internet experience more age-appropriate."" 
5Rights Foundation, a UK organisation campaigning for child safety in the digital environment, says such efforts are ""long overdue"".
Platforms should ""leave behind the 'don't look don't see attitude' that has led to millions of children being put at risk"", 5Rights says, adding that ""simply knowing the age of your users is not enough.""
Parents and guardians of teen Instagram users were given additional tools to supervise their child's experience on Instagram earlier this month. 
w set up time limits and view details of any reports their child makes on the platform.
will also be ""nudged"" to look at other content if repeatedly viewing the same topics on Instagram's explore page, and encouraged to ""take a break"" if continuously scrolling through reels.
Video selfies have become a popular way for digital platforms - such as online banking apps - to verify users' age or identity. 
Instagram currently uses video selfies as one way account holders can verify their identity if they get locked out of their account. 
Meta has partnered with UK digital identification provider Yoti, whose technology estimates age by analysing human faces and facial features.
Yoti says its algorithm, trained on anonymous people's facial images and their date of birth, cannot individually identify users or anything about them, except their age. 
Its latest white paper, published in May, said the technology was accurate for six to 12-year-olds with an error range of 1.36 years - and an error range of 1.52 years for 13 to 19-year-olds. 
Meta says both companies will delete the image once a user's age has been confirmed. 
Meanwhile, social vouching allows users to ask three mutual followers to confirm their age. Those being asked to confirm how old a user is must be at least 18, and cannot be vouching for any other users at the time. 
Dr Ysabel Gerrard, lecturer in digital media and society at the University of Sheffield, says Instagram's new age-verification methods are a welcome addition to just asking users to upload ID. 
But she says relying on age-verification tools as a way to protect young people online can overlook why they actually try to create adult accounts in the first place. 
""A lot of them are saying they're 18 on Instagram not to do bad things or view bad content,"" Dr Gerrard says.
""Being technically registered as an adult makes them feel safe because they don't think they're going to be targeted.""
For Dr Gerrard, Instagram's new verification mechanisms raise larger questions about what helps children to feel safe on social media platforms.
""Pretending to be an adult is one of them. It's a harsh reality, but we can't pretend it's not happening."""	/news/technology-61828900

health	Derby puppy that survived parvovirus home for Christmas	"A puppy that nearly died after contracting a virus will be spending his first Christmas with his family at home.
Ralph the cavapoo was just over eight weeks old when he was taken to Scarsdale Vets in Derby with diarrhoea and unusual behaviour.
He was quickly diagnosed with having parvovirus and was ""very touch and go"".
His owner Rebecca Dean said having their ""little fighter"" home would make it a good Christmas.
Mrs Dean, 29, said they had only had Ralph - a cavalier King Charles spaniel/poodle cross - for 24 hours before taking him to the vets on 25 September. 
She said: ""We noticed that he had constant diarrhoea and sickness, not eating and just not being a puppy.
""He started collapsing next to his water bowl.""
Seamus O'Cathail was one of the vets that treated Ralph.
He said: ""It was very quickly identified that he was infected with parvovirus.
""Parvovirus is an intestinal virus - it attacks the small intestines of a dog. Typically it affects young dogs, puppies would be most at risk.
""They can die very quickly from an infection if they're not properly treated.""
Ralph spent about 10 days in intensive care and was very close to developing sepsis.
Mr O'Cathail added: ""For a lot of that time he was very touch and go.""
Mrs Dean said it was ""quite scary"" for her family and she had to explain to her children that Ralph might not be coming home.
However, after a long stay at the vets, Ralph did get better.
Mrs Dean said having him at home this Christmas would be special.
""He's our little fighter. He's got plenty of Christmas presents - he is a very spoilt little doggie.
""It's going to be a very good Christmas,"" she added.

health	NHS Wales: Hospital staff 'in tears' over A&E pressures	"Keith Royles lived over the road from  the Ysbyty Glan Clwyd hospital
Patients being treated in chairs, staff in tears and an 18-hour wait for transfer from an ambulance.
re some of the extreme pressures experienced by the Royal Glamorgan Hospital's emergency department.
Dr Amanda Farrow was called in early to a recent shift at the site serving much of the south Wales valleys because the nurse in charge felt it was ""unsafe"".
On arrival, the number of patients awaiting beds was far higher than trollies available.
Meanwhile, six ambulances were queuing outside, unable to hand over their patients and, as a result, also unable to respond to other emergency calls.
Dr Farrow, the lead consultant at the A&E department of the hospital near Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said: ""She has never rung me before so I know when I get that phone call that I just need to get up and come in.
""We have 16 trolleys and we had 28 patients waiting for beds in the morning. Our resuscitation room was full and we had some very, very sick patients that all arrived at a similar time.
""Patients who are not on trollies are obviously sat in chairs, which is not a good experience. We also have a finite number of chairs in the clinical space.
""A number of members of staff were in tears.""
knock-on effect was soon felt outside the hospital's front door, with ambulances stacking up outside.
As a result the ambulance service was struggling to respond to urgent 999 calls in the community.  
""In extreme cases the department can receive an immediate release request, calling on them to admit a patient and release the ambulance as soon as possible to attend an extremely urgent call,"" said Dr Farrow.
""Yesterday during my shift we had two calls for an immediate release, because there was an unwell baby and there was a lady in labour."" 
""[With] the first one we did manage to bring the patient in, with a view to getting one of our patients out, But the [call] later in the day we were unable to accommodate.""
She continued: ""It is a lot of responsibility for the staff - none of us wants to be making these decisions. We're all doing our best and there is concern around the impact this is having on staff because that does cause moral injury.
""It's not just patients arriving in the ambulance. The majority of our patients actually self-present to the hospital. 
""We are having to pull them out of the boot of cars, they're coming by fire engine, with the police. We have to try and find somewhere to manage that and it's just a constant challenge.""
In September, Keith Royles, 85, broke his hip and was forced to wait seven hours for an ambulance, and then had to wait outside the hospital until the early hours of the morning.
His daughter Tina Royles told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that her parents were ""horrified"".
""My parents put their whole lives into nursing and they're quite disgusted, they understand the pressures on the NHS staff, but the system is broken.
She said as a former police officer she knows how busy A&E gets, but it was never like it is now. 
Despite the long wait, Ms Royles said the staff who looked after her dad were amazing. 
Lee Brooks, executive director of operations at the Welsh Ambulance Service, said he was deeply sorry about Mr Royles' experience, describing the seven-hour wait as unacceptable. 
""It will take a system-wide effort to resolve a system-wide issue and we continue to play our part to alleviate the pressure by treating more patients over the phone and at home and referring them to more appropriate areas of the NHS, negating the need for a trip to the emergency department.""
Dr Farrow stressed that being ""supportive to all of our staff"" is extremely important to the department.  
""We're a very close-knit team and we do try, at the end of the shift, [to] go around and chat to the staff just to make sure that everyone's OK,"" she said.
During the shift, the department was escalated to its highest level of alert  - level 4/20 - meaning staff from across departments worked together to try to free up beds on the wards to ease the pressure in A&E.
resulted in a decision to open dozens of beds as part of ""surge capacity"", including opening an unused ward. This in itself was difficult due to staff shortages.
re is also a dedicated team who try to identify patients, who, given the right care and support might be able to leave without being admitted.
Gladly by the next morning the situation had stabilised.
""We had good supportive response from the rest of the sites... so this morning it's really quite pleasant which is a change but yesterday was extremely challenging.""
But Dr Farrow said she worried about what lies ahead this winter as a result of staff shortages, the potential re-emergence of respiratory viruses like flu and the added demand of chronically ill patients who may have stayed away during Covid coming back into the system.
""It is quite scary to be honest. 
""I think every winter in recent years has been challenging and I think we're fearful this is going to be even worse."""	/news/uk-wales-63889127
technology	AI rapper FN Meka dropped by Capitol over racial stereotyping	"A record label has cut ties with an AI rapper after criticism it contained racial stereotypes, including repeated use of the N-word.
FN Meka is an artificial intelligence musician given the appearance of a black male cyborg.
But Capitol Music Group (CMG) faced a backlash for signing the rapper.
In a statement announcing they had severed ties, CMG offered its ""deepest apologies to the black community for our insensitivity"". 
FN Meka currently has more than 500,000 monthly Spotify subscribers and more than one billion views on its TikTok account.
Its Instagram account, which has more than 220,000 followers, has been made private.
FN Meka's songs are performed by an anonymous black man, according to Anthony Martini who is one of the cofounders of Factory New, a company responsible for the AI.
In an interview in 2021, he said a human voice ""performs the vocals, but we are working towards the ability to have a computer come up with and perform its own words - and even collaborate with other computers as co-writers"".
Before CMG dropped the rapper, black activist group Industry Blackout sent them an open letter saying FN Meka was ""offensive"" and ""a direct insult to the Black community and our culture"".
was ""an amalgamation of gross stereotypes, appropriative mannerisms that derive from Black artists, complete with slurs infused in lyrics"".
ut FN Meka had released a song with the rapper Gunna, who is currently awaiting trial in the US on criminal charges - with lyrics and social media posts being used as evidence.
""[He] is currently incarcerated for rapping the same type of lyrics this robot mimics. The difference is, your artificial rapper will not be subject to federal charges for such,"" they said.
""This digital effigy is a careless abomination and disrespectful to real people who face real consequences in real life.""

Speaking to the New York Times on Tuesday, before FN Meka was dropped, Mr Martini said he was anticipating it would happen due to ""clickbait headlines"". 
After being asked about an image of FN Meka being beaten by a police officer, he said: ""Some of the early content, now if you take it out of context, it obviously looks worse or different than it was intended.""
In their statement to Radio 1 Newsbeat, CMG also admitted to ""signing this project without asking enough questions"".

sports	Enid Bakewell: Meet England legend touring Australia in her 80s	"Not many 82-year-olds have spent their winter travelling to Australia from the UK to play cricket.
But, not many 82-year-olds are quite like Enid Bakewell.
1973 World Cup winner is considered one of the greatest female players of all time, having averaged almost 60 and taken 50 wickets at 16.62 in a Test career which ran from 1968 until 1979.
But Bakewell's playing career isn't over yet.
Fast forward 53 years, and the ICC Hall of Famer has once again returned from touring Australia and New Zealand - this time representing the East Anglian Veteran Ladies who played several fixtures against other veteran sides.
""We didn't win many games but that didn't matter, people felt good about it,"" said Bakewell.
""We played over-70s men, and they were very chivalrous, but they didn't want to lose.
""The New Zealand men seemed to be more friendly and approachable than the Australians. Of course, Australians always want to win.""
Playing in the opening match against Queensland Veterans Cricket Club, the Nottinghamshire-born trailblazer was named player of the match.
""I got given a bottle of wine, I can't remember that I did anything brilliant,"" said Bakewell, rather humbly.
Also in the East Anglian team was Janet Southgate (nee Allen), a former England team-mate and later captain who represented her country between 1976 and 1985. 
""Enid played and was agile in the field,"" said 67-year-old Southgate. ""At one stage she opened the batting, she was legitimately getting runs and they were not giving her anything. She batted in a couple games and fielded in all of them.
""She's absolutely loving it and she's a joy to be with and so many stories were shared from the past.""
You'd imagine retirement would be an appealing option for the stalwart whose only playing breaks have been when she started a family or when the occasional injury has struck, the latest a second knee operation.
Bakewell laughed: ""I did play when I was five-and-a-half months pregnant, and I fielded. I didn't want runs to be hit off my bowling.
""I did have to have a bit of a break when the children were born to recover. I used to run down the road with the pram to try and keep fit. It does work - but don't let go.""
In the summer, contracting Covid-19 prevented the then-81-year-old from attending Cricket Week, an annual tournament in Colwall, Herefordshire, featuring many prominent players of the past and present.
But that hasn't deterred the octogenarian. She's joined a Nottinghamshire-based walking cricket side, plays club cricket and occasionally helps her daughter's eight-a-side team.  
Bakewell named her second daughter Lynne after her mainstay batting partner Lynne Thomas. Despite the inspired name, Lynne has only recently decided to follow in her mother's footsteps.
""Ironically, Lynne is in her 50s and she's taken it up for the first time and is enjoying it,"" said Bakewell. ""They were short, and we arrived early, and she said 'mum do you want a game?'.
""So, I kept wicket, but everyone had to bowl so I bowled underarm as my arm isn't quite right. 
""I managed to catch a wicket behind the stumps, and we actually won. 
""There's another grandma who plays with her granddaughter and normally they don't win. So, they won their first game and then they won three games for the first time.""
While there may not be many 82-year-old women donning their whites, the message is clear: age doesn't have to be a barrier to playing cricket.
And Enid's secret to longevity in the game? 
""Keep the interest,"" she smiles. ""Cricket gives you something to keep your mind active and hopefully stop it from going senile.
""It's very much a mind game and you've got try and be a partner for the batter at the other end, and of course then when you're in the field, they're all your partners in the game.
""It's a great stimulus to the brain as well as the body."""	/sport/cricket/63973241
health	We waited three years to see a psychiatrist	"Nessie Simpson waited three years for an appointment with a psychiatrist but when it finally arrived it was 65 miles away from her home in Fort William.
""That's not ideal for someone who is anxious in the first place,"" she said.
Nessie has a range of mental health conditions including anxiety and bipolar disorder.
She said her mental health ""got very bad"" during the wait and sometimes she could not get out of bed or perform basic daily tasks.
Her niece Hayley McNamara, who also lives in Fort William, has also just got an appointment after more than three years.
""It was very difficult waiting for these appointments,"" she told BBC Scotland.
""I'm so thankful that I've had my family and friends with me, because I don't think I would have been here without them.""
Fort William is in the NHS Highland area which has a particular problem with its mental health teams being unable to serve huge rural areas.
More than half of people seeking psychological therapy in the Highland health board area face waits of more than a year.
mpares to a Scotland average of 15%.
New research from the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland (RCPS) found there is only one consultant psychiatrist for every 10,250 people across Scotland. 
Psychiatrists said the shortage could lead to ""painfully long waits"" for treatment.
In order to avoid the long waits faced by her friends, Nicole Buchanan opted to go private to get the help she urgently needed.
Her psychiatrist is also more than 60 miles away in Inverness but they speak on a weekly Zoom meeting.
""So for me I have to outsource away from Fort William to be able to get the help that I need, which not everyone can afford to do,"" she told BBC Scotland.
Nicole, Nessie and Hayley have all lost loved ones to suicide, and believe the area suffers disproportionately for a number of complex reasons. 
""I think because of where we live, it's so rural, there's not much around us, there's not much to do here,"" Nicole said.
""There's not much for those who don't like the outdoors to do here, without having to travel places and spend an absolute fortune.""
Fort William is billed as the outdoor capital of the UK and attracts thousands of tourists each year but the picture can be bleaker for locals.
Hayley said: ""Even our clothing shops, we used to have a place that sold dresses and jeans and stuff like that, but everything has closed and they've changed it to mountain clothing.""
Another big problem is drug abuse, according to Hayley.
""Everyone just goes to drugs instead,"" she said.
For Nessie, it is not that officials are not paying attention but rather ""they don't have the resources or staff"" to handle demand. 
Hayley said services had become so stretched that when help was finally offered, it was not always appropriate. 
""When you do finally speak to someone, I don't know if it's because I've had bad experiences but I've not been given the help I've needed,"" she said.
""It's kind of just like, 'here's some medication and we'll come and speak to you in six months'. You don't really get therapy here.""
Dr Jane Morris, who is vice-chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland, said the situation in rural areas was at a ""crisis point"".
""We are very concerned about our rural populations' mental health,"" she told BBC Scotland. 
""In the culture of rural areas, people have always been very stoical and some of them are quite reluctant to consider that they might have a mental condition that requires support.""
She said that when people did try to access support there were significant ""workforce problems"".
""Particularly coming out of Covid, we've got smaller and smaller mental health teams serving huge areas of the country,"" she said.
""Although perhaps only a third of Scots live in rural areas, they're spread out over far more than 50% of the land mass.
""That means everyone will have a long way to go to meet with a mental health team, and when it comes to the specialist psychiatric services, they will be even further away.""
Dr Morris said this required a ""spectrum of solutions"" and that one big asset would be rolling out distance mental health treatment over the internet, such as Zoom meetings.
But for those who have to come into hospital or be seen face-to-face hundreds of miles from home, she said transport paid up-front and visiting by families was paramount.
A spokesperson for NHS Highland said its mental health services had longer waiting times than it would like for some time.
Even before the Covid pandemic it recognised that investment was needed to ensure it had the workforce to meet demand.     
""We have seen a significant increase in need for assessment and support during the pandemic and this has further added to the waiting times that some people are experiencing,"" the spokesperson said.  
""We are aware of the pressures and distress long waiting times are causing the people who are waiting, and their families, and we apologise for this. 
""We are working hard to improve access as quickly as possible.""

technology	Tool to spot breast cancer at home wins UK Dyson award	"A device to help detect breast cancer has won the prestigious UK James Dyson Award.
Dotplot aims to help women self-check at home and track any changes they may find on an app.
Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK but many women do not carry out regular self-examinations. 
Medical professionals have welcomed the invention but warn it is no substitute for going to the doctor. 
Users build a personalised map of their torso by inputting their breast size and shape and pressing the handheld device over their chest.
Once a month, soundwaves are used to record tissue composition - and if there are any suspicious changes or abnormalities, users are advised to see a healthcare professional.
gy is very similar to mammograms for over-50s or ultrasound scans offered to women worried about a lump.
Oncologist Dr Frankie Jackson-Spence said: ""Obviously, it's in the early stages of development, so it does need to go through medicine regulatory device checks to make sure that it is actually adequate at detecting breast cancers. 
""It isn't a substitute for going to your doctor - it doesn't diagnose anything.""
rlier cancerous tissue is detected, the better. 
five-year survival rate for stage-one breast cancer is about 95%, which drops to about 25% by the time the cancer is in stage four.
Every year, there are 11,500 breast-cancer deaths in the UK. 
Only 1% of cases are in males.
But 64% of women aged 18-35 fail to regularly check their breasts, according Cancer Research UK and CoppaFeel.
""It's important that you check all over the breast - including up into the armpit and up to the collarbone,"" Dr Jackson-Spence said.
But it is not just about looking for lumps.
Manveet Basra wellbeing head at charity Breast Cancer Now, told BBC News: ""There are other signs of the disease to look for. 
""These include nipple discharge or dimpling or puckering of the skin of the breast. 
""While most breast changes, including lumps, won't be cancer, it's important to contact your GP as soon as possible if you notice a change to your breast that's new or unusual for you, as the sooner breast cancer is found, the more successful treatment is likely to be.""
Debra Babalola and Shefali Bohra, recent innovation design engineering graduates at Imperial College London and the Royal College of Art, co-founded Dotplot, after Ms Bohra discovered an unusual knot - which turned out to be harmless - in one of her breasts following a gym workout. 
""We just started to talk to clinicians and we spoke to loads of women,"" she said.
""We realised that women are looking for a way that not only tells them what has to be done but also teaches them how and why breast self-checks and supposed to be conducted. 
Ms Babalola said: ""We're not replacing medical professionals, we are enabling women to be confident in the self-checks they are doing."" 
Dotplot will now progress to the international stage of the James Dyson Award, with the winner announced on 16 November. 
ward describes itself as an international design award that celebrates, encourages and inspires the next generation of design engineers.
One in five inventors from the award go on to commercialise their inventions.

entertainment	Zac Efron on playing Chickie Donohue, the man who delivered beer in a warzone	"Greatest Beer Run Ever is the kind of title you might expect from a LadBible video, rather than a feature film released during awards season.
And while Apple TV's new movie, which stars Zac Efron and Russell Crowe, may not be traditional Oscars bait, it's worth looking beyond its somewhat trivial title.
Director Peter Farrelly's previous film, Green Book, won best picture in 2019, which means there is significant interest in the story he's chosen for his latest project. 
Greatest Beer Run Ever follows the true story of Chickie Donohue, a US marine who, in 1968, travelled across the world to deliver a crate of beer to his mates who were fighting in the Vietnam War.
At that time, morale among the soldiers was low, so the New Yorker set out on a four-month journey with a (presumably very heavy) bag of beer on his back, to lift their spirits.
Delivering beer to enlisted men from your neighbourhood is all fun and games, until Donohue actually gets there and is confronted with the quite brutal realities of war. (One character tells him the expedition is ""the dumbest thing I ever heard"".) Donohue himself had served four years in the Marines, but hadn't experienced combat.
""Tonally, it starts light,"" Farrelly told journalists earlier this month after the film's premiere in Toronto. ""The silliness of this guy trying to bring a beer to his friends in Vietnam is just nuts, and you see him smiling, then when he gets to Vietnam the reality hits and the tone changes, but it's natural. 
""It didn't take a lot of work on my part, it took a lot of work on [Efron's] part because he had to become a different guy along the way."" 
Efron says: ""I couldn't believe it was a true story, it just sounded like a very silly idea and young and stupid. But the journey that starts there is very magical and profound. So it's ended up one of the coolest gestures you can possibly make.""
f the film feels a little muddled, but that's partly because the tone of the original expedition must have been the same. The backdrop of bombs, deaths and blood jar somewhat with what Donohue is trying to do.
But, Efron argues: ""I love the human element you're able to find in some of the darkest moments, and there's always something that is unique or comes out of tension that can make you laugh.""
""What interested me,"" Farrelly adds, ""was it was a guy going into a war zone, during an act of war, to bring beer to his friends. I love that person, the stupidity of it, the hubris, and the amount of heart it takes for him to want to do that, and actually pull it off.""
Early reviews of the film have been mixed. IndieWire's Kate Erbland said Beer Run ""is not a gritty war picture; it's glossy and entertaining and often fun. Farrelly has got a story that requires both blind faith and nutty optimism"".
But, she acknowledged: ""For some viewers, the distance between straight-up entertainment and the Tet Offensive may be a bridge too far.""
Other critics were much less enthusiastic. The Hollywood Reporter's Michael Rechtshaffen called it ""a meandering, disjointed production that struggles throughout to find a satisfying tone"", while The Guardian's Charles Bramesco accused it of ""regurgitating every Vietnam cliché with the laziest possible visual diction"".
But with one best picture win under its belt thanks to the 2021 surprise hit Coda, Apple TV+ will be hoping The Greatest Beer Run Ever is firmly on Academy voters' radar.
For Farrelly, it marks the latest in a long line of road trip movies - something which he says is sheer coincidence.
""If you look at all my movies, they're almost all road trips,"" he notes. ""Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, There's Something About Mary, Three Stooges, Green Book, they're all road trips, and I don't know why that is. 
""I lived in the same house for my entire life growing up, we never moved, never went anywhere."" (""You're making up for it now!"" Efron chips in). ""Maybe that's part of it, I love road movies, but consciously I don't really think about them.""
film is adapted from the book Donohue wrote about his adventure, published in 2020, but the story first came across Farrelly's desk thanks to a 12-minute YouTube doc about the expedition, released five years earlier.
""Most of all, [Donohue] is motivated by this pure sense of love for his friends,"" Efron says. 
""But he doesn't have all the answers. He's brave enough to just kind of throw himself out there and follow through with a pretty crazy idea that he had while he was drunk.""
Farrelly concludes: ""I think there's a lesson in this movie - Vietnam was a bad war, and we didn't know it at first. When I say we, Americans thought it was World War Two, but it wasn't, it was a completely different thing. 
""It took years for the truth to come out, and finally by the 1970s Americans started seeing the reality of what that war was, and it was a disaster, it was bad, it didn't help anybody. Many Americans died and many more Vietnamese people died, and it was unnecessary.""
Greatest Beer Run Ever is released on Apple TV+ on Friday."	/news/entertainment-arts-62658754

health	Liverpool's Rowan Garth Care Home must improve or faces closure	"A care home could be shut down in six months' time if it fails to make improvements after a watchdog found its residents were at ""risk of harm"".
Care Quality Commission (CQC) rated Rowan Garth Care Home as inadequate following an inspection in September. 
It found staff at the care home on Lower Breck Road in Liverpool did not always effectively safeguard those living there.
Bloomcare Ltd, which runs the care home, apologised for its failings.
watchdog said it would take enforcement action, which could lead to the home being prevented from operating, if improvements are not made.
September was prompted in part due to the notification of an incident involving a resident who was allegedly abused.
In the report, it found the home was inadequate for its 95 residents.
Residents were described as being at an increased risk of abuse as prevention processes were not always followed, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reports.
CQC report also said multiple safeguarding incidents had also not been referred to Liverpool City Council for investigation, the report said.
But inspector found the senior management team ensured immediate action was taken to mitigate the failures highlighted in the report. 
""However, we are not yet assured that these actions are effective or embedded to ensure that the quality and safety of the service is consistently monitored and improved,"" the inspectors added.
Last year, Covid-19 prevention measures were highlighted as sub-standard with the highest numbers of Covid-related deaths in the city recorded at the home. 
A spokesman for Bloomcare Ltd, part of Wellington Healthcare (Adern Ltd), said it had taken immediate action and had a comprehensive action plan in place.
He said the alleged abuse was an isolated incident with full disclosure given to the relevant authorities.
""We are sorry to our residents and families that we fell short of expectations,"" he said.
""Like all good quality and responsible care providers, we strive to improve all the time and we will continue to do so.""

politics	Sizewell C: Government's progress on funding criticised	"Anti-nuclear power campaigners have criticised the government for not providing more financial information in its announcement about how Sizewell C could be funded.
government said applying a new funding model to the firm behind the plant in Suffolk was ""significant"".
It said private investors could be attracted by getting a return up front.
Stop Sizewell C said redacted figures meant it was impossible to know if it represented value for money.
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has outlined its draft reasons for designating Sizewell C's operating company, NNB Generation Company (SZC) Limited, as able to receive funding through the new Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model.
French energy company EDF and the UK government have said they would take 20% stakes in Sizewell C.
It has been estimated Sizewell C would cost £20bn to construct.
RAB would allow investors to get a return on their money during the build, rather than waiting until electricity was generated, the government said.
government said ""over the 60-year lifetime of a generic new large-scale nuclear power station, our funding model could reduce the project cost by more than £30bn"".
Energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng said the RAB designation represented ""significant progress towards implementing a new funding model which will give nuclear projects the financial support they need and attract private investment"".
""Private investors receive greater certainty through a lower and more reliable rate of return in the early stages of a project, lowering the cost of financing it, and ultimately helping reduce consumer electricity bills,"" he said.
government wants to build eight new nuclear power plants to reduce the UK's dependence on fossil fuels and energy imports.
While local councils and businesses expect Sizewell C to boost the local economy, opponents say nuclear plants are slow to build, expensive, inherently risky and threaten local wildlife.
Alison Downes, from Stop Sizewell C, said: ""It's outrageous that ministers are hiding the cost to electricity bill payers and the public purse of Sizewell C, while claiming to be transparent. 
""By redacting the finances, it is impossible to know if the secretary of state's judgement on value for money is sound.
""The government intends to take a special share in Sizewell C, as a means of 'protecting national security interests', yet there is no mention of removing China General Nuclear from the project.""
A separate decision on whether to grant government planning approval for Sizewell C is due on 8 July.

technology	Ofcom report shows growing 5G coverage	"About seven in 10 UK properties can now get 5G reception from at least one mobile operator, says a new report from media regulator Ofcom.
up from about half of all UK households 12 months ago, the Connected Nations report said.
umber of mobile phones able to use 5G has also risen significantly, doubling in the past year to one in five handsets, the Ofcom report found.
But some consumers say the connection speed is disappointing.
5G has received lots of investment from the mobile operators and government and is hailed as a faster, more reliable connection.
re are about 12,000 5G mobile sites now in the UK, almost double last year's figure: 86% of those are in England, 8% in Scotland, 4% in Wales and 2% in Northern Ireland.
Mark Jackson, of ISPreview.co.uk, told the BBC that 5G rollout has been ""slowed a bit"" by the government's decision to order networks to remove technology from Huawei by 2027, which ""caused engineers at most of the operators to focus on removing and replacing related 4G and 5G kit"".
5G traffic - the amount of voice and data flowing over the network - has trebled over the past 12 months and now corresponds to nearly 10% of all mobile traffic.   
A BBC report heard from a number of people who were disappointed with the performance of 5G they experienced.
Ofcom analysed crowdsourced data from Opensignal to help judge the quality of service across the UK. 
It found for 5G devices many more areas achieve a ""high performance"" level than for non-5G devices, but found that - even for 5G - few areas met the ""highest performance"" level. 
Ofcom told the BBC it wanted to see investment in 5G networks. 
It said ""The UK's mobile companies are still in the process of rolling out 5G and are at different stages of extending their networks. So customers' experience will vary by their location and network.
""We'll be taking further steps over the coming year to shine a light on this, so people can see for themselves which operators are leading the way for quality of service."" 
me report found more than 12 million households - 42% of UK homes - now have the option to get a full-fibre broadband connection, an increase of 4.3 million from last year.
Full-fibre connections and upgraded cable networks can deliver download speeds of one gigabit per second (Gbit/s) or higher - fast enough to download an HD movie in under a minute.
report found 70% of UK homes could receive a Gigabit-capable connection. Last year they were available in less than half the UK. 
But only about 25% of households are taking up these faster connections, according to Ofcom.
Mr Jackson said after recent ""dramatic"" improvements in coverage, largely on the basis of private sector investment, he expected ""gigabit coverage to grow more slowly"".
Nearly 80,000 homes and businesses do not have access to ""decent"" broadband, defined as offering download speeds of 10 Mbit/s the report notes. That is fast enough to stream an HD film or game, but will run into problems if more than one person tries to stream at once.
figure has fallen from 123,000 last year, with Ofcom acknowledging that many of those still without ""decent"" broadband are in the hardest-to-reach parts of the UK. 
regulator said it estimates that a further 15,000 properties will be covered by publicly-funded broadband schemes going ahead in the coming 12 months.
government recently announced plans for a trial of Elon Musk's Starlink system to provide broadband to some of the most inaccessible locations in the UK. Starlink uses a constellation of thousands of low Earth orbit satellites to deliver a broadband connection.
f Starlink surprised some commentators, as the government owns a stake in another rival broadband-via-satellite firm, OneWeb.
government told the BBC it was down to ""the readiness and availability"" of Starlink's technology. 
Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it continued to discuss ""other solutions and services"" with suppliers, ""including OneWeb, at more complex sites""."	/news/technology-63974085

entertainment	Krept: Rapper branches out into making baby skincare products	"Krept, one half of rap duo Krept & Konan, talks about mixing music and entrepreneurship, for our business advice series CEO Secrets.
Rap star Krept sees himself as a local entrepreneur as much as a musician. 
His songs, like Waste My Time, G-Love and Freak of the Week, have been been streamed millions of times. He's enjoyed top 10 albums and singles, played to massive crowds at festivals around the world and fronted The Rap Game TV show. 
But setting up his own restaurant and seeing it thrive in the place where he grew up gives him equal satisfaction.
Crepes & Cones opened in Croydon in 2018. It's decorated with pictures of Krept & Konan and their music idols.
Krept - real name Casyo Johnson - has to be careful about when he chooses to dine there. If he goes when it's busy, fans will spot him and mob him for selfies and he'll hardly get a chance to put a fork to his mouth.
""It's a very big deal to me,"" he explains, sitting at one of his tables. ""When I was growing up I couldn't even visualise a place like this. I want it to be an inspiration, a message, so people round here know this is what can happen if you work hard.""
Krept & Konan grew up on council estates in Gipsy Hill and Thornton Heath in south London, where they were both caught up in gang violence. Krept has lost friends who died as a result of gang feuds. Others have gone to jail.
""We always wanted to do something that was bigger than just music,"" says Krept. ""Not everyone can do music, but there are so many opportunities out there, if you have a business mind. I mean, we're not professional restaurateurs, but I've always just had the business mindset.
""Even in school, aged 14, I used to buy drinks, sweets and crisps from supermarkets and sell them to the students.""
kills proved to be useful.
Krept shares his business advice: always 'over-deliver'
""The music industry itself is a hustle,"" explains the softly-spoken Krept. ""You have to network with people, to make songs with people. There's a lot I could take from the music world into the business world and our success there gave us hunger to try other things.""
Since their breakthrough album The Long Way Home in 2015, Krept & Konan have embarked on high-profile collaborations as their stock rose in the hip hop world.
In decades past, rock and punk musicians have typically cast themselves as rebels against the stuffy, conventional world of business. But hip hop artists have embraced the mantle of the entrepreneur with pride.
Last year Rihanna became a billionaire and it's thanks to profits from her cosmetics range Fenty Beauty, not her musical catalogue of smash hits.
Rapper Jay-Z was already a member of that exclusive club too, after building an empire based on music, property, fashion and investments. Kanye West owns a burger chain and has made a fortune from fashion deals.
re can be a practical reason for this, explains Krept. Many contracts in the music industry do not favour the artist, meaning even those who enjoy huge hits may not be making as much money as you think. 
wn case, he says, and it's one of the reasons why he has had to be entrepreneurial, with everything from concert ticket sales, to fashion endorsement deals and podcasts. It helped that he studied accountancy at university.
His latest business venture is in fact a skincare range for babies, called Nala's Baby. It came about after he became a father two years ago. 
His co-parent and now business partner Sasha Ellese Gilbert wanted to find a cream that had as few impurities as possible, so they developed one and named it after their daughter. 
Nala's Baby is marketed as being suitable for babies with eczema issues or sensitive skin, while also being vegan, animal cruelty-free and dermatologically approved. 
roduct is now stocked in Boots stores around the country and is expanding its reach. 
worlds of rap and babycare products may seem worlds apart, but Krept doesn't see a problem bridging this divide.
""It's my reality. I have a kid and I'm a rapper. Just because I rap it doesn't change the fact of being a father,"" he says.
""Anybody who has a kid, we go through the same journey of caring and loving a child. We bathe them, feed them, go through the terrible twos. I might be a rapper, this person might be an engineer, doctor or teacher. It's as genuine to me as it is to them.""
But does it pose a branding issue, when so much of rapping and business is about presentation?
world of the rapper, as played out in endless music videos - including his own - is often one of violence, confrontations with the law and the portrayal of women as disposable objects of desire. 
ry different to the world typically portrayed when advertising baby products, which is one of soft colours, domestic family bliss and doting parents. 
""Music is entertainment, it can be like being in a film or acting,"" says Krept, after considering the question. ""But this is how we grew up: friends dying, ending up in jail, being involved in gangs.
""Those are the cards we were dealt. I have friends still involved in that today, we can't help our upbringing.""
Krept says his music simply portrays his reality growing up - including the lyrics about women - and it's by coming from that authentic place in his music that he has created new opportunities for himself - so that he can be defined by something else.
He mentions Jay-Z as an inspiration, going from a life of crime in the New York projects to becoming ""one of the greatest rappers and entrepreneurs of his generation"".
""Because this is how we grew up,"" asks Krept, ""does it mean we can't do great things and grow as people?""
In 2020 Krept & Konan were awarded the British Empire Medal in the Queen's Birthday Honour's list, for their contribution to the community in Croydon. It recognised their creation of the Positive Direction Foundation, which creates opportunities for young people through music education.
""If you could get all the time back you wasted from procrastinating, imagine what you could do?"" says Krept, unprompted.
""That's one thing about me, I've always been great at time management, so I can do multiple things, I plan my days. 
""I think I will end up with multiple businesses, but I will never let anything dilute my music. I dedicate my nights to the music.""

sports	Beau Greaves: Five facts about 18-year-old darts sensation	"Beau Greaves is the teenage sensation about to make history at the PDC World Championships.
18-year-old from Doncaster got into darts at the age of 10. On Friday, she will become the youngest woman to compete at the championship in its 30-year history when she faces world number 37 William O'Connor.
Want to know more about darts' most exciting young player? Here are a few facts about Greaves.
Greaves comes into this tournament in terrific form. The Guardian reports that she has won 66 consecutive matchesexternal-link and eight tournament titles in a row on the PDC Women's Series. Not bad. 
In light of Greaves' performances this year, several of the top male players at the World Championship, including defending champion Peter Wright, have said they do not want to face her.
""Sometimes I forget that I am still a teenager,"" Greaves said. ""I am only 18 and I forget that when I am doing all this stuff.
""I never thought of it as a dream. I was more for just playing the ladies darts and I was content with that. It sort of happened, I didn't plan it or expect it.""
Fallon Sherrock became a trailblazer for women in darts when she got to the third round of the 2020 World Championship. 
However, Greaves beat her at a tournament in Wigan earlier this year to claim a spot at Alexandra Palace.
""I don't want to be compared to Fallon,"" says Greaves. ""What she did was amazing, but I want to do my own thing and just sort of keep to myself and keep enjoying it.""
In April, aged 18, Greaves beat Kirsty Hutchinson 4-0 to win the WDF World Championship.
revious youngest winner of a World Championship was 21. By winning the tournament, she set the record for both male and female competitors. 
Greaves has been given one of the more apt sporting nicknames in 'Beau 'n' Arrow'.
She saidexternal-link that the name was suggested by one of her dad's mates in Doncaster and ended up sticking.
Not too surprisingly, despite all her accolades, Greaves is still a normal teenager in most respects.
""Sometimes you are on a proper high and you come back and mum is having a go about something,"" she said. ""It is such a contrast when you come back from a darting weekend, I have never been treated any differently and I wouldn't want that anyway.""
Greaves has already set the darts world alight. And she is confident that she can go even further.
""I feel like no one has ever seen me play how I can really play,"" she said. ""I feel like I have got gears and I can turn it on when I need to.""

entertainment	Geoff Wonfor: Tributes to Beatles, Band Aid and The Tube director	"Musicians and actors have paid tribute to Grammy-winning filmmaker Geoff Wonfor who has died aged 73.
Newcastle-born director's works included the Beatles Anthology series, 80s pop show The Tube and music video Band Aid 20 in 2004.
His close friend and musician Ray Laidlaw described him as a ""man of the people"" and an ""incredible talent"". 
Presenter Denise Welch praised Wonfor as a ""wonderful father, grandfather and friend"" and a ""North East Titan"".
His family said he was a ""huge presence with a heart to match"" and a ""world class filmmaker"" who ""leaves behind an amazing body of work"".
Laidlaw, from the band Lindisfarne, said he had known Wonfor since they were in their early 20s and the director was an ""amazing inspiration"" to him.
""He had an amazing zest for life and was a wonderful bloke to be around,"" he told BBC Look North. 
""[He was] So creative and a man of the people... he would be much happier being with the crew in the pub.""
V presenter Welch tweeted she was ""so, so sad to hear of the death of the legend"".
Filmmaker Ray Spencer recalled Wonfor was ""always warm, generous and what stories he could tell"".
In 1997, Wonfor won a Grammy award for best music video for the Beatles Anthology, an eight-part TV series chronicling the history of the band.
He spent five years on the project and subsequently worked on a number of music videos with Sir Paul McCartney.
Actor Tim Healy, who worked with the director on the Sunday for Sammy charity events, said he was ""a genius director, soul mate and joy to be with"".
In 1977 Wonfor spent spent four days following Muhammad Ali around during his tour of Britain.
He previously told the BBC: ""It was amazing, the greatest thrill of my life. We didn't know what to expect we never dreamed there would be crowds like that, it was immense.
""I couldn't believe the size of him, like a brick outhouse, but so gentle and he did everything that was expected of him.""
In a statement, the filmmaker's daughter Sam said: ""We are devastated to have lost our Dad and Gramps and are finding it impossible to imagine a world without him in it. 
""He was a one-off - a huge presence with a heart to match. 
""His warmth, humour and encyclopaedic capacity for remembering jokes of all qualities ensured people who met him rarely forgot him - and that has been borne out by the wave of wonderful messages and tributes we've received since his passing. 
""He loved what he did and we're so very grateful he got to continue doing it to the end.""

business	Greene King brewery five-day strike ends	"A five-day strike by 188 staff working for brewery giant Greene King has ended without a resolution to a pay dispute and with more action planned.
Walk-outs took place at sites in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk; Eastwood, Notts; and Abingdon, Oxon.
Unite said union members had rejected an offer of a 3% pay rise and one-off payment of £650, and more strikes were planned for 21-23 December.
Greene King said it was ""disappointed"" its offer had been rejected.
Unite said the pay offer was a substantial real-term wage cut, because of inflation.
Unite regional officer Mark Jaina said strike action was not something the union wanted.
""Nobody wants to willingly go out on strike and stand in the freezing cold for five days, eight hours a day, but that's the situation we've been put in,"" he said.
Mr Jaina said workers were ""sympathetic to the people that like their favourite tipple, but their wages are of paramount importance"".
A Greene King spokesperson said: ""We can assure customers that this week's industrial action has not caused significant disruption and pubs across the country continue receiving deliveries from us.
""We have received notice for further industrial action from the afternoon of Wednesday, 21 December until the end of Friday, 23 December, but the large majority of our Christmas deliveries will already be completed by this point and we will ensure any disruption to customers is kept to an absolute minimum. 
""We remain disappointed that the union encouraged its members to reject our offer and we've met regularly with members of Unite over the past few months and explained how we aim to be fair and consistent across our business, given the challenging wider economic environment currently.""

entertainment	Ofcom: BBC made significant editorial failings over antisemitism bus attack report	"BBC committed ""significant editorial failings"" in its reporting of an antisemitic attack on Jewish students, Ofcom has found.
media watchdog observed that the BBC failed to follow its editorial guidelines on due impartiality and due accuracy in a 2021 online article.
A separate BBC London news broadcast on the same story did not breach due impartiality or accuracy rules.
However, Ofcom said the BBC had made a serious editorial misjudgement.
urred on 29 November 2021, when a group of Jewish students were subjected to an antisemitic attack while travelling on a privately-hired bus on Oxford Street, London, where they had been celebrating the festival of Hanukkah.
In its coverage, the BBC reported that an anti-Muslim slur had been heard from inside the bus, but following BBC coverage on 2 December, the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Chief Rabbi were among a significant number of groups and individuals who complained to the broadcaster about the accuracy and impartiality of its reporting.
Board of Deputies of British Jews said: ""Ofcom's ruling on the BBC's conduct in relation to the antisemitic Oxford Street attack has made it clear that 'the BBC failed to observe its editorial guidelines on due impartiality and due accuracy', and has described the corporation's 'serious editorial misjudgement' in this matter. 
""This ruling, in response to the board's written complaint, validates our significant concern over the BBC's actions on this issue. We will now consider whether to take this issue to a judicial review.""
Ofcom said in a statement: ""Our investigation uncovered significant editorial failings in the BBC's reporting of an antisemitic attack on Jewish students travelling on board a bus in London.
""The BBC's reports claimed that an audio recording made during the incident included anti-Muslim slurs - which it later changed to the singular 'slur' - which came from inside the bus. Shortly afterwards, it received evidence which disputed this interpretation of the audio.""
Ofcom noted that the BBC received evidence to support an alternative explanation that the words it had heard were in fact a Hebrew phrase, meaning ""Call someone, it's urgent"".
Its statement continued: ""The BBC failed to promptly acknowledge that the audio was disputed and did not update its online news article to reflect this for almost eight weeks. During this time the BBC was aware that the article's content was causing significant distress and anxiety to the victims of the attack and the wider Jewish community.
""This, in our opinion, was a significant failure to observe its editorial guidelines to report news with due accuracy and due impartiality.""
A BBC spokesperson said: ""While Ofcom has found that our reporting was not in breach of the Broadcasting Code, the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit ruled in January this year that more could have been done sooner to acknowledge the differing views about what could be heard on the recording of the attack. The BBC apologised at the time for not acting sooner to highlight that the contents of the recording was contested.""
Under the BBC's Charter and Agreement, set by the government, the BBC is responsible for the editorial standards of its online material. 
Ofcom can consider and give an opinion instead, including any recommendations it considers appropriate regarding online material but it cannot find the BBC in breach of the broadcasting code.
Regarding the TV broadcast, Ofcom said that while the report did not breach its rules, ""the BBC made a serious editorial misjudgement by not reporting on air, at any point, that the claim it had made about anti-Muslim slurs was disputed, once new evidence emerged"".
watchdog said the BBC's ""failure to respond promptly and transparently created an impression of defensiveness by the BBC among the Jewish community"".
Ofcom said the BBC has ""further to go in learning how to respond when its reporting is in contention"".
A spokesperson for the Campaign Against Antisemitism said: ""Almost a year after the BBC's abominable coverage of an antisemitic incident on Oxford Street, Ofcom has seen what every viewer and reader of the BBC's coverage could but which the BBC itself refused to accept: its reportage added insult to the injury already inflicted on the victims and the Jewish community, and abysmally failed to meet the most basic editorial standards.
""Ofcom's decision today begins to undo that insult.
""Sadly, the BBC's stonewalling is exactly what British Jews have come to expect from our public broadcaster."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63541437
politics	Penny Mordaunt: Brexiteer popular with the Tory grassroots	"Penny Mordaunt has become the first Conservative MP to officially announce she is standing to replace Liz Truss as Tory leader and prime minister.
She was one of the less well-known candidates in the summer Tory leadership contest, but made it through to the final three. 
In the first four ballots of Tory MPs in July, she came a clear second behind Rishi Sunak. She eventually lost out to Mr Sunak and Liz Truss in the last round, before Conservative members had the final say.
Her strong showing was rewarded when she was named Leader of the House of Commons by Ms Truss in her first day in office. 
Since then, she has impressed colleagues at Westminster with a series of sure-footed appearances and her use of humour in the Commons, at a time when crisis was engulfing the government. 
Pressed by Labour shadow Thangam Debbonaire on why she had not even mustered a nod for Ms Truss during Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Mordaunt replied: ""My resting face is that of a bulldog chewing a wasp, and people shouldn't read too much into that.""
Ms Debbonaire also challenged her about comments she was reported to have made at the Conservative Party conference, that ""our policy is great but our comms is shit"". The shadow leader suggested the government's policies were ""also shhh ... shocking, too"". 
Ms Mordaunt said she had been ""playing to the crowd as I was addressing a room full of communication professionals"" - and added, to cheers from Tory MPs: ""It is the anti-growth coalition whose policies are shhh ... shocking.""  
Just days before Ms Truss announced she was quitting, the Commons leader fronted up for her, answering an urgent question tabled by Labour for the the prime minister.
She denied Ms Truss was dodging scrutiny or hiding ""under a desk"" by sending Ms Mordaunt to cover for her.
Meanwhile, Ms Mordaunt raised her profile with the wider public by leading the Accession Council ceremony of the new King at St James's Palace, two days after the death of Queen Elizabeth II. 
Her role as Lord President of the Privy Council meant she played a central part in the event - which was televised for the first time.   
Opinion polls have suggested Ms Mordaunt is popular with Tory members, and she has put in the work on the so-called ""rubber chicken"" circuit of Tory fundraisers and charity dinners.
49-year-old Portsmouth North MP has been in and around government for the best part of a decade and even had a brief spell as a reality TV star.
She was a prominent backer of Brexit in the 2016 EU referendum. 
ughter of a paratrooper and a special needs teacher, she was born in Torquay but grew up in Portsmouth, and, like Ms Truss, was educated at a comprehensive school, before going to university.
In an eclectic career before politics, she worked as a magician's assistant, in hospitals and orphanages in post-Communist Romania, and for the Freight Transport Association. 
She headed the Conservative Party's youth wing and was a press officer for William Hague when he was leader. 
But she is probably best known outside Westminster for taking part in ITV's celebrity diving show Splash! in 2014. 
Penny Mordaunt relives her moment diving in to a swimming pool on TV and admits ""it hurt a bit"" as she hit the water
She did not win but earned praised from Tom Daley and other judges for ""having a go"".   
She was armed forces minister under David Cameron and became the first woman to serve as defence secretary. She held the role under Theresa May, but was sacked after a few months when Boris Johnson took over as PM.  
Launching her leadership campaign back in July, Ms Mordaunt pitched herself as the candidate ""Labour fear the most"".
She promised to return to traditional Conservative values of ""low tax, [a] small state and personal responsibility"".
rade minister committed herself to a 50% cut in VAT on fuel to help ease the cost-of-living crisis, but did not go as far as some other candidates in the leadership race in offering tax cuts.
And writing in the Daily Mail, Ms Mordaunt - who was a Royal Navy reservist - promised to honour the UK's Nato commitment of spending 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030. 
At her launch event in Westminster, Ms Mordaunt declined to describe Mr Johnson as a good prime minister, thanking him for delivering Brexit but pledging to restore ""standards and trust"". 
She promised to put ""power back into the hands of parents"" through personal budgets allowing them access to subsidised childcare at any time before their child started school.
Supporters of other candidates criticised Ms Mordaunt for supporting trans rights when she was equalities minister and the so-called ""culture war"" issue was raised by journalists. 
Asked where she stood on gender, the trade minister replied: ""I think it was Margaret Thatcher who said 'Every prime minister needs a Willie [then Deputy Prime Minister Willie Whitelaw]'. A woman like me doesn't have one.
""I'm a woman, I'm biologically a woman. If you've been in the Royal Navy, and you have competed physically against men, you understand the biological difference between men and women.""
Ms Mordaunt came under fire from former Brexit minister Lord Frost who said he had ""grave reservations"" about the idea of her becoming PM.
He told TalkTV: ""She was my deputy - notionally, more than really - in the Brexit talks last year.
""I felt she did not master the detail that was necessary in the negotiations. She wouldn't always deliver tough messages to the European Union when that was necessary.
""She wasn't fully accountable, she wasn't always visible. Sometimes I didn't even know where she was.""  
During the Brexit referendum, Ms Mordaunt provoked a row when she told the BBC the UK could not veto Turkey joining the European Union. 
An hour later, David Cameron told ITV that was ""absolutely wrong"".  
Later that year she was in the headlines again for a speech she gave in the Commons on poultry welfare, which turned out to be an excuse to slip some very unparliamentary language into proceedings.
She admitted she had made the speech - with its liberal use of the words ""lay"", ""laid"" and ""cock welfare"" - for a bet."	/news/uk-politics-62163328
business	Royal Mail workers begin wave of Christmas strikes	"usands of postal workers at Royal Mail are on strike over pay and conditions, potentially causing disruption to customers' festive deliveries.
More than 115,000 staff walked out on Friday, with more strikes to follow in the run-up to Christmas.
Recent talks between the CWU union and Royal Mail have broken down.
Members of the union are expected to continue striking on Sunday as well as on 14, 15, 23 and 24 December.
Although there are no letter deliveries on Sundays, there are parcel deliveries, and Royal Mail also processes mail on a Sunday for delivery on a Monday.
Last week, Royal Mail advised people to post Christmas mail earlier than usual due to the strikes.
Millions of letters have reportedly been piling up as negotiations have stalled, while it has brought forward the final suggested date for sending second class post to 12 December from 19 December, and for first class to 16 December from 21 December.
union has said staff want a pay rise that matches the soaring cost of living and has accused management of trying to ""force through thousands of compulsory redundancies"".
Workers carrying placards demanding the removal of Royal Mail's chief executive Simon Thompson gathered outside the Mount Pleasant Mail Centre in London - the company's largest sorting site in the UK. 
One employee Nick, who has worked for Royal Mail for 38 years, told the BBC that although he had walked out during previous strikes, the distance between management and unions appeared to him to be wider in this wave of industrial action.
""It seems to me there's not really a negotiation. It is a take it or leave it deal where they are attacking our terms and conditions.""
Inside the sorting office, parcels and letters continued to be sorted by a skeleton crew of 100 people, compared to the 1,000 employees who normally work at the centre.
Joy, who has been with Royal Mail for 28 years, told the BBC he had chosen to come to work on a strike day because ""I want to please my customers because of the peak time"". 
He said that firms are worried about business after the height of the pandemic. ""They need their letters and their mail ASAP,"" he said.""I want to keep moving the mail.""
Members of the CWU also staged a rally on Friday afternoon outside Parliament in central London.
union's general secretary, Dave Ward, said at the rally that the union was preparing a fresh ballot over further strike action in January. 
But speaking during a visit to an RAF base in Lincolnshire, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that he was not ruling out extending ""tough"" new anti-strike laws to prevent walkouts by emergency service workers.
He said the government was ""looking at all options"" when he was asked about the potential changes to the law to limit the impact of strikes.
most recent dispute in the postal industry began this summer after Royal Mail rejected demands for a pay rise that matched inflation - the rate at which prices rise - which is currently 11.1%.
Royal Mail has been struggling as it moves from its traditional business of delivering letters, which is no longer profitable, to parcel deliveries.
It wants to cut 10,000 jobs by next August, which will include 6,000 redundancies and thousands of other roles that will not be filled as staff leave.
It also argues that it needs to modernise how the business works to accommodate a rise in parcel deliveries, which would mean changing workers' hours.
Dave Ward, the CWU general secretary, said: ""Royal Mail bosses are risking a Christmas meltdown because of their stubborn refusal to treat their employees with respect.
""Postal workers want to get on with serving the communities they belong to, delivering Christmas gifts and tackling the backlog from recent weeks.
""But they know their value, and they will not meekly accept the casualisation of their jobs, the destruction of their conditions and the impoverishment of their families.""
ks have broken down between the union and Royal Mail, a spokesman said, adding that Royal Mail managers are ""refusing to budge with their 'best and final' offer"".
ffer includes a 9% pay deal over 18 months and ""a number of other concessions to terms and agreements"", Royal Mail said.
A spokesman said: ""We spent three more days at [conciliation service] Acas this week to discuss what needs to happen for the strikes to be lifted.
""In the end, all we received was another request for more pay, without the changes needed to fund the pay offer,"" he said, adding that the union ""knows full well"" that the business is losing more than £1m a day.
