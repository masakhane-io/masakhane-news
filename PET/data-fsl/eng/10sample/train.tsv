entertainment	Peaky Blinders dance show: 'Anyone who likes Strictly can love this'	"""An independent dance company, dedicated to bringing dance to the people,"" declares Birmingham's best-known gangster Tommy Shelby in an episode from series five of the hit TV series Peaky Blinders.
mmy is hosting a lavish birthday dinner at his country pile for his wife Lizzie with guests including fascist leader Oswald Mosley.
gang leader introduces a performance of Swan Lake featuring dancers from renowned company Rambert, which captivates the majority of the audience but sends his brother and partner in crime Arthur to sleep.
Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight is confident no-one will be dozing off during his latest venture, a real-life dance show called Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby, again in collaboration with Rambert, but on a much bigger scale.
Having also worked with the London-based company on that TV episode and 2019's Peaky Blinders festival, Knight was keen to bring the dance experience to a new audience.
""I'm the least likely person to attend a dance show,"" he says. ""And yet the experience I've had watching rehearsals... is absolutely fantastic. I really want to get that message out there that if you think you don't like dance, come and see the show and you'll find out that you do. Anyone who likes Strictly can love this show.""
Knight explains that he wasn't a dance fan before Rambert got involved with the BBC TV series ""simply because I'd never been"", adding: ""It's like going to your first football match and you go 'oh wow, it's brilliant'.""
Dance critic Lyndsey Winship says it can be difficult to attract new audiences to dance because of preconceptions: ""So many people love to dance, or to watch dance on TV, but would never think of going to see a stage show. So something with a well-known title and story like Peaky Blinders is a good way of tempting them into the theatre. 
""In the popular imagination, dance is still so often associated with ballet and Swan Lake and fairy tales, but the contemporary dance scene is so much more than that, and it's great if people's eyes can be opened to that.""
roduction begins as a prequel with the Shelby boys fighting in the trenches during World War One, but then it ""takes us through into a very familiar story, and it's not giving too much away to say it's about Tommy and Grace"", Knight explains. The pair's tragic romance will already be familiar to fans of the TV show.
Rambert's artistic director Benoit Swan Pouffer is the creative lead behind the production and is keen to point out that his interpretation is not just focused on the machismo of the leading male characters.
""When the young men went to the war, who ran the world? Who was doing the labour and working? Women,"" he says. ""There's always a sense of that in the show. I wanted to put forward the strength of the woman as well. I have male and female and non-binary dancers.""
Much of the story is told through dance and staging with no dialogue other than some narration courtesy of Benjamin Zephaniah, who plays Jeremiah in the BBC One series. 
""It's a great challenge to try to tell a story without words. But fortunately, Benoit and Rambert are masters at it,"" Knight says. 
""And so what I did was put some things down on paper and then handed it over to Benoit, he's crafted it and changed it and made it what it is now.""
Pouffer adds that Knight ""was surprised that I asked him to write a script, but that was my blueprint. Once I had this it was easier to... create the show because I was anchored in a good way with his vision.""
I'm curious to know how challenging it was to cast such iconic characters that are known to millions, particularly Cillian Murphy's Tommy.
""It's not about the physical aspects… you really need to understand who those characters are,"" Pouffer tells me. 
""Who is Polly? Who is Jeremiah? Who is Arthur? Rambert is a company made up of individuals who can tell stories naturally and that was even before Peaky Blinders, so it was pretty easy to cast because I have strong personalities in the company. And it was very organic.
""Human beings are complex. Tommy Shelby is a complex man with a lot of layers of sensibility. He is not just a bandit. You understand the reason why he's acting that way, his struggle and his hurt,"" he continues.
""And through what Steven wrote us, it really pushes forward this dilemma that Tommy has in his head and in his life. Through the show, you will have this journey of understanding of what makes a Peaky Blinder and why Tommy Shelby has this redemption.""
Four young dancers from the company landed the lead roles - Seren Williams and Prince Lyons will share the parts of Tommy and Grace with Guillaume Queau and Naya Lovell.
Williams says: ""We're not necessarily copying and pasting what you see in the series, we're taking the mindset of the characters… and translating that into movement, so there's still similarities between them.""
Lyons adds: ""We have a lead who is a white male and I'm clearly not a white male!
""You are watching a different idea and it's kind of forcing you to view this world in a completely different light, the same way that a white Ariel [from The Little Mermaid] would look completely different to the new Ariel that's coming out. It's forcing you to use a bit of your imagination.
""The same way that if you were to read a book, if the author didn't fully describe what these characters look like, depending on who you are and who you grew up around, you make your own opinions based on what you've gone through and the culture around you.""
He adds: ""I just hope that audiences are able to view the beauty of our interpretation.""
Knight has three things he would like the audience to come away with.
""I want them to have had a fantastic evening. I want them to be quite emotional at the end of it. And for them to go away thinking dance is something that they enjoy.""
w opens in Birmingham later this month.
Knight smiles. ""It can't be anywhere else.""
Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby premieres at the Birmingham Hippodrome on 27 September followed by a run at Wembley Park ahead of a UK tour next year."	/news/entertainment-arts-62966638
business	Pensions, savings and mortgages - your questions answered	"Since the announcement of the government's mini-budget in September, financial markets have been in turmoil, with investors concerned about how tax cuts would be paid for.
Some pension funds risked collapse, and the Bank of England had to step in to lower that risk.
Meanwhile, five-year mortgage rates hit 12-year highs. Mortgage rates had been rising for months, but increased sharply after the mini-budget.
BBC personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey answers your questions about pensions and mortgages.
Heather Wing asks whether, following the deadline from the Bank of England, her occupational pension is safe.
It is correct that the Bank of England has told pension funds that its emergency bond-buying operation will end this week.
rgeted at a specific section of the pensions sector. Importantly, the warning does not extend to the pension savers themselves.
Even if you have a so-called defined benefit pension, that will be safe, experts say.
If one of these pension funds did get into trouble, then the employer is legally obliged to pump money into the scheme. In the unlikely event that doing so puts the employer out of business then there is a safety net called the Pension Protection Fund.
Read more: How safe is my pension?
Andy Atkinson, from Rugby, asks whether he should be worried about his defined contribution and defined benefit pensions.
First things first, some definitions.
A defined contribution pension is when you build up a pot of pension savings which is invested. On retirement, you have various options.
One of those is to buy an annuity with all, or part, of that pot. Recent events mean annuity deals are actually better than they have been for some time.
A defined benefit pension is a bit different. It sees the amount you receive in retirement depend on how long you have been in the scheme and your salary during that time.
Some of the funds which control these pensions have been at the centre of the turbulence of recent days.
However, pensions consultants stress that, whatever type of pension you have, it is safe.
Don Brown wants to know: ""Will the state pension keep up with the cost of living?""
re is some upheaval in the pensions sector at the moment, but that will not affect your state pension.
government has already committed to honouring the triple-lock. So, your state pension next April will rise in line with the highest of inflation, wages, or 2.5%.
Inflation - the annual rate of rising prices - will clearly be the highest, at about 10% or so. We will get that number next week, when the next set of official inflation figures is published.
Of course, pensioners are facing higher prices now, but the backstop of the triple lock always lags behind the current situation - for better or worse.
Moving on to mortgages, Callum, from Leeds, is saving for a first home and wants to know what help is available.
He says: ""I make just under £1,500 a month after tax. National Insurance and Income Tax reductions will only save me £16 a month, meanwhile prices of everything are skyrocketing.""
Clearly as you watch mortgages getting more expensive, it may feel like buying a home is increasingly difficult.
Ministers will point to the help offered in the mini-budget, which means first-time buyers in England and Northern Ireland will only pay stamp duty on properties above £425,000, rather than £300,000, as well as discounts above that.
Savings rates are improving, and house price rises look set to stall or reverse, according to experts.
But, as is always the case, the security of your job and income, and how much you earn, will be key factors when judging what home you can afford.
Ethan Jones from Wolverhampton asks: ""What's the worst that can happen if I can't afford to pay my mortgage for say, three consecutive months?""
You are technically defined as being in arrears after missing two or more months of payments.
universal advice from debt charities here is to avoid putting your head in the sand.
If you are struggling, or know you will struggle, to make your monthly repayments, then you should contact your lender. Charities can also offer free, independent guidance.
Your lender is obliged to treat you fairly and consider any request to pay, for example, just part of the payment for a short period.
It is not allowed to repossess your home unless all reasonable attempts to resolve the situation have failed.
Kam Wan asks: ""Are my savings safe in a bank or building society?""
question that was asked a lot during the financial crisis over a decade ago, which was a very different scenario.
wer is yes. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme completely protects the first £85,000 saved per person, per financial institution if a bank or building society goes bust.
If you have more savings than that, experts suggest putting it into different accounts with different providers.
And, just to stress, there is no suggestion of a threat to the future of any banks or building societies right now.

gation led by a HR firm is understood to be separate to allegations made against one of the party's Senedd members.
Plaid Cymru chairman Marc Jones said he was taking ""all these matters and processes very seriously"".
Last week Rhys ab Owen, MS for south Wales central was suspended from his party's group, following what was understood to be a serious allegation about his conduct. 
uspension is pending an investigation by the Welsh Parliament's Standards Commissioner.
BBC Wales has spoken to several sources who say there is substantial unease within the party about the way allegations have been dealt with, and say concerns were raised about Rhys ab Owen's conduct last year. 
One source spoke of an ""awful culture"" in the party and a ""lack of leadership"". 
Mr Jones said that: ""While at this point we naturally cannot share any information on any individual cases or allegations, I want to assure all Plaid Cymru members that I take all these matters and processes very seriously. 
""We have engaged external HR experts to assist our work.
""We are offering support to all staff, as we prioritise their wellbeing. We are carrying out a survey of staff experiences that will inform future decision making.
""Consistent with not prejudicing the outcome of any ongoing investigation, we will be open as we can as we continue to ensure that all our internal processes are followed diligently at all times.""
On ITV's Sharp End Plaid Cymru Senedd group chair Llyr Gruffydd denied claims made in a Wales online article of a ""toxic atmosphere"" in his party where people are afraid to report allegations. 
He said he did not recognise that there was a wider problem within Plaid Cymru.
Speaking at the time of Mr ab Owen's suspension, a spokesperson for the Plaid Cymru group in the Senedd said: ""Rhys ab Owen MS, Plaid Cymru member of the Senedd for south Wales central, and the Plaid Cymru group in the Senedd have mutually agreed to his temporary suspension from the Plaid Cymru group.
""This is a neutral act, without prejudice, pending the conclusion of an investigation by the Senedd standards commissioner into an alleged breach of the code of conduct for members of the Senedd. No further comment will be issued.""

politics	Chester by-election: Sunak fails first by-election test, says Rayner	"Angela Rayner on Chester by-election: Rishi Sunak failed in first test as leader
Rishi Sunak has ""failed"" his first electoral test as Labour held Chester in a by-election with an increased vote share, Angela Rayner has said.
Labour's deputy leader said voters ""have given a big message to the Conservatives that they want change"".
Samantha Dixon was elected with a 10,974 majority, and a 61% vote share - Labour's best ever result in the seat.
Repeating the 13.6% swing from the Tories nationally would win Labour a majority, pollster John Curtice said.
Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said that the result was ""pretty much expected"".
Ms Donelan argued the Conservative Party was ""focused on delivering for the British public"".
Lord Hayward, a Conservative peer and elections analyst, said: ""Rishi has to convince the public at large that he can manage out of this crisis, whichever crisis one's looking at - and there's a lot of them.""
Ms Rayner said Chester voters had shown they ""want a Labour government"".
Labour Leader Keir Starmer, called the election ""a very, very good result for the Labour Party"".
Sir Keir said: The Labour Party has been putting forward a positive plan for the future, how we stabilise and grow our economy.
""The government is worn out, tired and crashed the economy and the verdict was very clearly given.""
In her victory speech, Ms Dixon said voters had delivered a message to Mr Sunak that the Conservatives ""no longer have a mandate to govern"".
Labour had been expected to retain the seat, which it won in 2019 by a majority of 6,164. 
In that election, the Conservatives came second, winning 38% of the vote. Labour and the Liberal Democrats secured 50% and 7% respectively.
me around, Ms Dixon won with a 61% share, easily defeating Conservative Liz Wardlaw on a 41% turnout.
Very little about this result is surprising, but that doesn't mean it's not significant. 
Labour held the seat and boosted their share of the vote, while support for the Conservatives dropped. 
Sir Keir Starmer can point to this win as evidence that Labour's lead in the opinion polls is reflected in the real world. 
Conservatives say they've been given a ""bloody nose"", as is often the case for governments mid-term, and a message from voters that they need to deliver. 
Labour insiders are talking up the win as a ""thumping result"", with the party's biggest ever majority in the city of Chester.
But Tories in the region, braced for defeat, say with some relief that it could've been worse. 
It's always risky projecting by-election results onto the national picture - but as a snapshot, this one tells us Labour has built on its support in a seat that's been Conservative in the past and for the Tories, the electoral outlook is bleak. 
Sir John Curtice told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Labour are in a stronger position than they have been at any point in the last 12 years.""
13.6% swing from Conservatives to Labour would be enough for Labour to form a new government, Sir John said, but ""wouldn't produce an enormous majority"" were it to be replicated in a general election.
Labour's Samantha Dixon won the city's by-election, securing more than 61% of the vote.
was triggered by the resignation of previous Labour MP Christian Matheson.
He stood down after Parliament's watchdog recommended his suspension for ""serious sexual misconduct"".
Conservatives have performed badly in recent by-elections, losing Wakefield to Labour and the historically safe Tory seat of Tiverton and Honiton to the Liberal Democrats. 
feats increased political pressure on Boris Johnson, who later resigned as prime minister.
ursday's by-election was the first to take place since Mr Johnson quit and his successor Liz Truss caused market turbulence with her mini-Budget. 
Analysis
By Kaleigh Watterson, Cheshire political reporter
Even though it wasn't a completely unexpected result, people from the Labour Party here in Chester are very happy with a near 11,000 majority. 
Labour seat since 2015 and, out speaking to people on the streets, there were more people saying they were going to vote for them.
Labour campaign was a lot more active too. We saw a lot of shadow ministers coming to visit - big hitters like Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves and former leader Ed Miliband.
Sam Dixon - a former leader of Cheshire West and Chester Council - was keen to showcase her local links.
mattered - some of the candidates told me the first question asked of them was: ""Are you from Chester?"" 
With a Conservative candidate living in a neighbouring council area and minimal ministerial visits, the question can be asked: Did the Conservatives really have their heart in this one? "	/news/uk-politics-63825130
business	Evergrande: Crisis-hit property giant faces deadline after bosses quit	"Embattled Chinese real estate giant Evergrande is expected to deliver a preliminary restructuring plan this week, following the exit of two bosses.
firm says its chief executive and finance head have resigned, after an internal probe found that they misused around $2bn (£1.7bn) in loans.
Evergrande has more than $300bn in liabilities and defaulted on its debts late last year.
risis has spooked traders who fear contagion in China's property sector.
On Friday, Evergrande said it found that chief executive Xia Haijun and chief financial officer Pan Darong were involved in diverting 13.4bn yuan ($2bn; £1.7bn) in loans secured by its property services unit to the wider group.
firm said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that Mr Xia and Mr Pan had resigned because of their ""involvement in the arrangement of the pledges"".
In a separate statement, it said the funds ""were transferred and diverted back to the group via third parties and were used for the general operations of the group"".
Evergrande added that it was in talks with its property services unit over a repayment plan.
A $2.6bn deal to sell a majority stake in the unit to a rival developer fell through in October.
Evergrande, which is the world's most indebted property developer, had been struggling to make payments on its over $300bn of liabilities and missed a crucial repayment deadline on its offshore debt in December.
Its shares have fallen by more than 75% over the last year in Hong Kong and have been suspended from trading for months.
mpany is scheduled to announce a preliminary plan to restructure its debts before next week.
China's property crisis is estimated to have wiped more than a trillion dollars off the value of the sector last year.
ry serious potential fallout from Evergrande collapsing has led some analysts to suggest that Beijing may step in.
On Monday, Japanese banking giant Nomura said ""an increasing number of developers have failed to repay their debt and continue their construction works"" since the Evergrande crisis.
Also on Monday, it was reported that China was planning to start a real estate fund to support more than a dozen property developers, including Evergrande.
fund could be worth up to 300bn yuan, according to reports.
Home sales in China have fallen for 11 consecutive months, official data shows. That is the longest slump since China created a private property market in the late 1990s.
Several Chinese developers have halted the construction of homes that had already been sold, because of concerns over cash flow.
In recent weeks, some home buyers have threatened to stop paying their mortgages until the work restarts.
More than 200 projects by at least 80 developers have been affected, according to the Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution.
China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has pledged to help local governments in ""guaranteeing the delivery of homes,"" state media reported.

politics	Angela Rayner aide Jack McKenna cleared of wrongdoing by Labour	"A senior aide to Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner has been cleared of any wrongdoing following an internal investigation.
Ms Rayner's communications chief Jack McKenna was suspended by the party almost a year ago.
was seen at the time as a sign of rising tensions between Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and his deputy.
Sir Keir had earlier tried but did not succeed in moving Ms Rayner to another role in a reshuffle.
Mr McKenna - who had also been a party official under Jeremy Corbyn - was accused of a data breach.
But he, in turn, complained that news of his suspension had been leaked before he had been told of it - in other words, that his own data had been breached.
Labour officials described the period of his suspension as ""leave"".
Privately, some officials close to the Labour leader were keen for him to go.
While still being paid by the party, he was unable to carry out his duties on behalf of Angela Rayner.
He has now decided to leave his post as her communications director and will seek a new challenge.
In a statement, the Labour Party acknowledged that information about his employment status had wrongly been made public last year.
A spokesman said: 'We unreservedly condemn misleading and unauthorised leaks about Jack to the media. 
""In that context, we wish to make clear that Jack leaves the Labour Party with a clean record and without any disciplinary action against him.'
His work was praised both by Sir Keir Starmer and Ms Rayner, who called him a ""consummate professional"".
It is rare for such statements to be made by the Labour Party following internal investigations or disciplinary processes.
fact that it has done so in this case would suggest the party had been facing the prospect of legal action, and that a settlement - perhaps a substantial settlement - had been reached out of court.
Neither Labour nor Mr McKenna would comment on the legal situation."	/news/uk-politics-63600697

Info wars host Jones has been forced to pay $1.44bn (£1.2bn) in damages after falsely and repeatedly claiming that the Sandy Hook school shooting, in which 20 children and six adults were killed, was a hoax.
In August 2018 he was banned from Facebook, Spotify, Apple and YouTube.

On a video posted on the platform Rumble, Jones said he did not care about being on Twitter, reports news website Axios.
Mr Trump has yet to tweet, despite his reactivated account now having more than 90 million followers.
He has said he intends to stay on his own platform, Truth Social, although this has a fraction of the audience of Twitter. 
Mr Trump was a prolific tweeter until he was banned for allegedly inciting violence on the platform during the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021.
Ye was banned for an antisemitic post in October 2022.

business	Argentina rate hiked to 69.5% as inflation hits 20-year high	"Argentina's central bank has raised its main rate of interest to 69.5% as it tries to contain soaring inflation.
k put up its 28-day benchmark rate by 9.5% percentage points, its second hike in as many weeks.
It comes as new figures showed inflation in the country had hit a 20-year high of over 70%.
umbers dashed hopes that price rises had peaked after the latest US data showed that inflation had eased.
""The rise in the policy rate will help reduce inflation expectations for the remainder of the year,"" the bank said in a statement.
move came after the bank raised the rate by 8 percentage points two weeks ago and marks its eighth hike this year.
untry's inflation rate is forecast to top 90% by the end of the year.
Controlling soaring prices, tackling high debt levels and reining in government spending in South America's second largest economy are at the top of the agenda for Argentina's latest economy minister, Sergio Massa.
Mr Massa, who is the third person to hold the post since early last month, aims to calm inflation using a more conventional approach than his predecessors.
Along with raising interest rates, he has pledged to not call on the central bank to print more money this year to fund government spending.
In July, Martín Guzmán resigned as finance minister after being in the role for more than two and a half years. His successor Silvina Batakis lasted just a month in the post.
Earlier this year, Argentina avoided defaulting on a $44bn International Monetary Fund loan.
However, the impact of measures the government has to implement to meet the conditions of the deal is a major cause of concern for many in the country.

health	Gender recognition law reform 'positive for transgender community'	"Reform of gender recognition laws would have a ""significant positive impact"" for NI's transgender community, a Stormont report has found.
research was commissioned in May 2021 by Conor Murphy when he was finance minister.
A group at Queen's University Belfast conducted the review of NI's current legislation. 
It has now been published by the Department of Finance and makes a series of recommendations.
Gender Recognition Act (GRA) has been used in Northern Ireland since 2005 to allow people to change their legal gender.
At present, people apply to a UK gender recognition panel and, typically, must present a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.
Applicants need to be at least 18 years old and provide two medical reports, one from a specialist detailing their diagnosis and another listing any treatment or surgery they may have had to change their sexual characteristics.
must prove they have lived full-time in their acquired gender for at least two years. 
uld involve showing they have used a different name in official documents, or changed their gender on their driving licence or passport - and swear an oath that they intend to continue for the rest of their lives.
report states that the available data shows that in Northern Ireland, 92 births have been re-registered following the issue of a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) since 2005.
research adds: ""While this number is not large, it may not indicate low interest in the application but, primarily, a reluctance to apply given difficulties.""
It also says that transgender people who responded to the research who had gone through the GRC process said it was ""long, complicated, dehumanising, costly and exclusionary"".
In Scotland, legislation to make it easier for people to legally change their gender, also referred to as a ""self-declaration"" system, is going through the devolved parliament in Holyrood.
Its plan would see applications handled by the Registrar General for Scotland, rather than the UK panel.
No diagnosis or medical reports would be required and the period in which applicants need to have lived in their acquired gender would be cut to three months.
One of the most controversial proposals is to lower the minimum age that someone can apply from 18 to 16 - although an amendment to the bill that has been backed by the government means that 16 and 17-year-olds would need to have lived as their acquired gender for six months rather than three.
Republic of Ireland made similar changes in 2015 and had granted an average of 115 applications per year up to 2020.
Department of Finance's report also described services for people seeking to change their gender as ""severely lacking"".
""There is one gender identity clinic which is located in Belfast and for which there are long waiting times to access the service.""
m from Queen's University conducted several focus groups and surveys as part of its research into the current process in Northern Ireland.
It recommended that any policy change should take into account ""the physical and mental health consequences of undergoing the gender recognition process, with the aim of supporting applicants to navigate the process safely"".
It added, however, that women's safety has ""emerged as a strong argument against reform and should be taken into account"" when considering a policy change.
ue has become contentious, with some campaigners saying that allowing anyone to ""self-identify"" as a woman could impact on the rights women have fought for decades to secure, and which are themselves enshrined in equalities law.
re are also concerns about access to women-only spaces and services, including hospital wards and refuges.
report concludes that the level of public debate about gender recognition is ""sometimes causing harm to the transgender community"".
It adds that: ""Whereas a potential reform of the GRA is perceived as threatening to a part of the community, it would have a significant positive impact for the transgender community. 
""Our analysis shows that although the potential harm is unlikely to be substantial, change would need to be carefully enacted and communicated to minimise concerns and harm on both sides.""
Without a functioning government at Stormont, there are no ministers in place to consider the report and decide whether to bring forward legislation to make changes to current policy."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63949943

It will show King Charles' first Christmas message, along with box-office hits Matilda the Musical and Avator: The Way of Water.
Co-owner Jonathan Moore said he was expecting a ""lovely, happy atmosphere"".
family-run cinema, which opened in 1914, is the sixth oldest, continuously-running cinema in the UK.
Mr Moore said Keswick had a ""slightly elderly population"" and last year many were still wary of travelling to be with family elsewhere because of the pandemic.
""There were a lot of people with not a lot to do - we said, 'we would like you to come here',"" he added.
ue has already sold about 50 tickets and as well as offering warmth, the business will donate its share of ticket sales and sales of sweets to the Cumbria Community Foundation Winter Warmth Fund.
It will show five films throughout the day - Matilda the Musical, The Muppet Christmas Carol, Elf, The Bishop's Wife, and Avator: The Way of Water.
""It's a very nice vibe,"" Mr Moore added.
""If people fall asleep at the cinema [after their Christmas dinner] that's fine, I'll just turn the volume up to cover the snoring,"" he added.

technology	Albania severs diplomatic ties with Iran over cyber-attack	"Albania has severed diplomatic ties with Iran and ordered Iranian embassy staff to leave, accusing it of orchestrating a major cyber-attack.  
Prime Minister Edi Rama said a probe had found ""incontrovertible evidence"" that Iran ""hired four groups to mount the attack on Albania"" on 15 July.
kers tried to paralyse public services, delete and steal government data, and incite chaos, he added.
In response, Iran rejected Mr Rama's claims as ""baseless.""
Its foreign ministry condemned the decision to expel its diplomats as ""anti-Iranian"" and suggested in a statement that ""third parties"" may have been involved in coming up with the accusations, Iran's state news agency reported.
Albania's leader described the decision as ""extreme"" but said it was ""entirely forced on us"". 
United States said it strongly condemned the cyber-attack on a Nato ally and vowed to hold Iran accountable for actions that threatened Albania's security.
Relations between Tirana and Tehran have been tense since Albania offered asylum to thousands of Iranian dissidents.
Mr Rama said in a televised statement that the goal of the hacking groups had been ""the destruction of the digital infrastructure of the government of the Republic of Albania, as well as the theft of data and electronic communications of governments systems"".
But he added: ""The said attack failed its purpose... all systems came back fully operational and there was no irreversible wiping of data.""
rime minister said the Albanian government's decision to sever diplomatic relations with Iran was ""proportionate to the seriousness and danger posed by the cyber-attack"".
US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said American experts had also concluded that Iran ""conducted this reckless and irresponsible cyber-attack"" and that it was ""responsible for subsequent hack and leak operations"".
Iran's conduct, she warned, ""disregards norms of responsible peacetime state behaviour in cyber-space"".
Earlier this month, US cyber-security firm Mandiant said it had concluded ""with moderate confidence"" that ""one or multiple threat actors who have operated in support of Iranian goals"" were involved in the attack. 
Mandiant noted that the disruption had come days before the start of a conference in Albanian town of Manez that was affiliated with the exiled Iranian opposition group Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK). 
was subsequently postponed following warnings of ""terrorist"" threats.
firm likewise cited a video featuring the Albanian residence permits of purported MEK members that was posted on the Telegram channel used by a group named ""HomeLand Justice"" to claim credit for the cyber-attack.
It said a ransomware sample also included the text: ""Why should our taxes be spent on the benefit of DURRES terrorists?"" 
Manez is a town in Durres County and is the location of a camp where about 3,000 MEK members have been allowed to live since 2013 at the request of the US and United Nations.
""This is possibly the strongest public response to a cyber-attack we have ever seen,"" John Hultquist, Mandiant's vice-president of intelligence, said following Albania's announcement.
He added that the attack was ""a reminder that while the most aggressive Iranian cyber-activity is generally focused in the Middle East region, it is by no means limited to it"". 
Mr Hultquist also warned that it showed major critical government systems in Nato countries were ""vulnerable and under attack""."	/news/world-europe-62821757
business	Cost of living: Young professionals targeted by investment scams	"Young professionals trying to make and save money to cope with the soaring cost of living are at risk of being exploited by scams, banks have warned.
re being targeted on social media by scams which claim to offer a money-making investment opportunity.
Younger people are particularly vulnerable to these cons as they try to boost their income to pay rising bills, according to banking group UK Finance.
Safety groups have also warned about dangerous, cheap, second-hand goods.
Young people are being approached on social media with offers of investments that are said to bring quick, high returns.
Fraud prevention service Cifas said that fraudsters quickly directed victims off these platforms to private emails or accounts, where their details and money were then stolen.
A survey by UK Finance suggested that more than a third (34%) of 18 to 34-year-olds said they would respond to an unprompted approach from someone offering an investment opportunity or a loan, with 30% saying they might also provide their personal or financial details to secure the arrangement.
""The rise in the cost of living can be worrying and stressful and for many, keeping on top of finances might be a struggle,"" said Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance. 
""It's important for everyone to be conscious of criminals taking advantage of people's anxieties around finances by staying alert for fraud.
""We encourage everyone to follow the advice of the Take Five campaign - always be cautious of any messages or calls you receive and stop and think before sharing your personal or financial information. Avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails or text messages.""
Recent figures from UK Finance showed that £609.8m was lost due to fraud and scams in the first half of this year.
Consumer safety charity, Electrical Safety First, is also warning younger people to be careful when buying second-hand products instead of new ones to save money.
It said more than 40% of consumers it asked in a survey were considering buying second-hand electrical items as an alternative to new products, specifically owing to the cost-of-living squeeze. That rose to two-thirds of 25 to 34-year-olds.
rity is urging everyone to perform spot checks of older, second-hand electrical goods that could present a risk due to damage, years of wear and tear or be subject to a safety recall.
""Check the product you're buying isn't recalled and that it is fitted with a UK plug. Ensure cables aren't frayed or wires exposed and always register a second-hand product when you get it home,"" said Martyn Allen, technical director of Electrical Safety First.
""Second-hand goods can be great for saving money and better for the environment but no purchase should ever leave you at risk."""	/news/business-63399127
politics	Rishi Sunak: Northern Ireland issues to test new PM	"It is a given that political leaders come and go, but never have prime ministers regenerated quite so rapidly.
recent parallels between Downing Street and Doctor Who do not end there.
Like the show, which on Sunday brought back David Tennant as the charismatic Time Lord, in politics there is now talk of Julian Smith returning as Northern Ireland Secretary.
Whether that is just wishful thinking, or an actual possibility, is up to Rishi Sunak.
He was a vocal supporter of the former chancellor, who now has the biggest role in UK politics, having lost out to Liz Truss after his first audition to Tory members.
And given the new prime minister has to oversee a looming deadline in Northern Ireland this week, who he sends there will be important.
urrent Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is not exactly a fan of Rishi Sunak. 
He was intimately involved in the campaign for a Boris Johnson comeback, despite being one of many cabinet ministers who had urged him to resign in the summer.
On Monday, Mr Heaton-Harris changed his stance, pledging to back Mr Sunak.
Convention goes that he could be sacked as Mr Sunak chooses his cabinet, unless he opts to retain some Johnson supporters, which is not impossible, given there is absolutely nothing conventional about politics at the moment.
re is the endorsement Team Sunak received from Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker on Sunday. 
In a significant step, the outspoken Brexiteer - who previously backed Liz Truss - said Mr Sunak was the right candidate to solve the Northern Ireland Protocol dispute and unite the Tory party.
It is possible Mr Baker's support could land him a promotion to the top job in the Northern Ireland Office.
Or it could even end up going to another MP unknown to most here before landing in Belfast, which would mean a fourth NI Secretary in four months. 
Ultimately, whoever is in the job by this Friday, 28 October, will have a call to make. 
Do they push ahead with what Mr Heaton-Harris vowed: that if, by 00:01 BST on Friday, an executive at Stormont has not reformed, a date for another assembly election will be set?
Or, does the new Sunak administration change tack and introduce last-minute legislation to delay the deadline?
Or, does it push back any talk of polls for several weeks, given that there is a 12-week period built into the current law in which to hold a fresh election?
None of the political parties at Stormont are in favour of another election and instead hope a reset at Westminster could prevent a pre-Christmas poll.
ugh given the chaos still consuming Westminster, we cannot quite rule out a general election happening sooner than is scheduled in two years' time.
Election or no election yet, the Northern Ireland Protocol remains an issue that neither of Mr Sunak's predecessors managed to sort out.
While he did vote for Brexit in the 2016 referendum, the new PM was not initially in favour of the controversial NI Protocol bill - legislation that sought to scrap large parts of the original deal.
Introduced by Liz Truss to parliament during her brief stint as foreign secretary and currently being scrutinised in the Lords, can those still backing it be sure of its future under a new government? 
re is also the question of how Mr Sunak will be received by the DUP, which privately backed his rival in the last leadership race and expressed concerns about how he would manage the protocol dispute. 
Meanwhile, Sinn Féin has in recent days argued that the British and Irish governments will have to consider joint authority, if devolution remains mothballed.
Rishi Sunak only made his first visit to Northern Ireland in the summer, attending the Tory leadership hustings at a hotel outside Belfast.
While he spoke briefly about wanting to renegotiate the protocol, there was zero detail during a half-hour Q&A and he has yet to be tested on virtually all policies relating to Northern Ireland.
re are also questions for him as to when exactly households in Northern Ireland will get access to the £400 energy bills discount, which were promised by Liz Truss and Boris Johnson's respective administrations.
Few expect Northern Ireland to rank highly on the new government's agenda, but, just days into being, it will have some big decisions to make about this place.
No longer the understudy, how Rishi Sunak handles Northern Ireland will play a part in how the biggest performance of his political career is eventually rated."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63371828

Fielding, 35, weighed in a pound over the 175lbs limit but the fight will still go ahead in Bournemouth.
Azeez can add the Commonwealth belt to the British title he already holds, but Fielding cannot win either title.
""I don't read too much into the weight. It is what it is,"" Azeez said of his opponent's failure to make weight.
""Whether he comes over the weight, under the weight, we've still got Saturday night to deal with and that's what I'm focused on.""

Were Fielding to win on Saturday, Azeez would remain the British champion and the Commonwealth title would stay vacant.
Azeez, 33, faces his toughest test to date in the form of former WBA (Regular) super-middleweight champion Fielding.
Fielding is 30-2 in his career, with his only defeats against then-world champions Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Callum Smith at super-middleweight.

entertainment	Joe Lycett did not shred £10k in David Beckham Qatar protest	"Comedian Joe Lycett has revealed he did not really shred £10,000 during a protest against David Beckham's role as an ambassador for the Qatar World Cup.
Lycett livestreamed himself apparently destroying the cash on Sunday after the ex-England footballer did not respond to his ultimatum to drop the job in support of LGBT people.
On Monday, Lycett confirmed he had in fact donated the money to charity.
He said destroying the cash would have been ""irresponsible"".
Some LGBT fans have boycotted the Fifa Men's World Cup over Qatar's treatment of gay people, as same-sex relationships are criminalised in the country.
In a video update posted on Twitter, Lycett explained: ""The truth is, the money that went into the shredder was real, but the money that came out was fake.
""In fact, the 10 grand had already been donated to LGBTQ+ charities before I even pressed send on the initial tweet last week.""
""I would never destroy real money,"" he told his followers, ""I would never be so irresponsible."" 
Addressing Beckham directly, he added: ""I never expected to hear from you - it was an empty threat designed to get people talking.
""In many ways, it was like your deal with Qatar, David - total [rubbish] from the start.""
In the previous video, Lycett described Beckham as a ""gay icon"" but warned that this status was now under threat. 
Birmingham-born comic ended his latest update by actually shredding a copy of Beckham's Attitude front cover, saying he had been given the blessing of the magazine, which was the first gay publication to shoot a Premier League star.
Warning: Lycett's video reveal contains some strong language.
ublicity stunt, which took place on the same day the controversial World Cup began, initially received a mixed reaction.
Some defended Lycett, arguing that he had succeeded in gaining more than £10,000 worth of valuable publicity for the LGBT cause; while others suggested he should have instead donated the money to charity, which it now transpires he has done.
rtainer shared a video of the apparent shredding on social media alongside the caption ""a platform for progress"", using a phrase Beckham himself had used in a promotional campaign about the tournament in the Middle East.

In the clip, Lycett was seen placing wads of what appeared to be cash into an industrial shredder while wearing a rainbow tulle outfit, but it was not clear whether the banknotes were genuine.
He set the former England captain a deadline of midday on 20 November to take action after it was reported he had signed a £10m deal with the Fifa World Cup hosts.
median said he would donate £10,000 of his own money to LGBT charities if Beckham ended the sponsorship deal before the tournament started.
Beckham has not publicly commented on Lycett's stunt.
World Cup has been shrouded in controversy due to issues around LGBT rights in Qatar, along with the host nation's treatment of migrant workers.
It continued on Monday as it was confirmed that England, Wales and other European nations will not wear the OneLove armband at the World Cup because of the threat of players being booked.
, including England's Harry Kane and Gareth Bale of Wales, had planned to wear the armband during matches to promote diversity and inclusion.

technology	Akon’s Wakanda, grazing goats and a crumbling crypto dream	"RnB singer Akon says his much-delayed plans for Akon City - an African metropolis on the Senegalese coast - are ""100,000% moving"". 
Although goats are currently grazing on the site, he says that critics will look ""super stupid"" in the future.
In an exclusive interview with the BBC, the Smack That singer also assured supporters waiting for refunds from his Token of Appreciation cryptocurrency campaign that they will receive their money back, even if he has to pay them out of his own pocket.
Widely known for his string of noughties chart hits Akon, who was born in the United States but partly raised in Senegal, announced two ambitious projects in 2018 that were supposed to represent the future of African society. 
first was a reported $6bn (£5bn) city with boldly curvaceous skyscrapers. It was to run on the second initiative - a brand new cryptocurrency called Akoin. 
But several years on both projects have faced difficulties and delays and the site where the city is proposed to be built remains a waste ground.
On an overcast day in September 2020 Akon, dressed in a powder blue suit, strode confidently onto a dusty red patch of disused land. There to meet him was a gaggle of journalists from around the world who had assembled for the hitmaker's latest launch: a supercity packed with stunning architecture.
Local people clapped as a veil was pulled back on a plaque marking the future building site. But two years on the question of whether the plans will ever come to fruition divides communities in the region.
""We thought we could work on it but at this pace, maybe our children will,"" one resident of the area tells the BBC. ""We remain hopeful for the project. We hope that our children will stay here to work.""
Another resident says they no longer believe in the project before adding ""when it comes, if it finds us here, we'll see how we can contribute"". 
Akon City was initially compared in the press with Wakanda, the amazing African metropolis featured in the Black Panther movies and comic books. Phase one of the city containing roads, a campus, a mall, residences, hotels, a police station, a school, a waste facility and a solar power plant was supposed to be complete by the end of 2023. But after multiple delays, little on the ground appears to have changed since the launch ceremony.
""I'm only here in the presence of goats"" local journalist Borso Tall tells me. ""It's completely empty... no sign of building just a long line of green trees and red earth.""
But Akon remains adamant that his ambitious plans will still be realised.
When we meet in central London, he admits that with hindsight ""I would have gotten more things in place before promoting it."" 
He also blames Covid, which he says meant ""everything would be pushed back two years"".
However, the world was already in the grip of the pandemic when he held the ceremony promoting Akon City to international media in August 2020. 
""I plan to retire in that city,"" he says confidently. ""I don't like to use the word the king of the city. But that's what it will turn out to be.""
""We're trying to get the city built as fast as possible,"" he says, adding that he has a lease on the land for the next 50 years and that his project has ""been co-signed by the current president"". 
Senegalese government's tourist board SAPCO recently reaffirmed their commitment to the project. 
""We believe in Akon city and we are all supporting Akon so the Akon city will come to life,"" said Me Aliou Sow, CEO of SAPCO. ""It will attract tourists and investors in the region and SAPCO is fully committed to the success of this project.""
Akon says he has changed both the construction firms and architects he is working with on the project, adding that his new partners understand Africa, the terrain and have ""real credibility globally"". His overall goals remain ambitious. 
""We want the big skyscrapers. My goal is to try to build something that people deem impossible in Africa, right?""
Several celebrity finance websites estimate Akon's net worth to be between $60-80m, leading some to question where the money will come from for a project of this size. His team claim they have an international consortium in place who will fund it with private investment. 
Akon said that excavation work on the site will finally start before the end of the year, adding that further announcements will be made at a youth centre he has built for residents in a local village. Construction work on Akon City he acknowledges ""is yet to be fully calendered"". 
for Akon City, dubbed it ""Crypto City"" and in August 2020 Akon said the city's financial infrastructure would be ""built off"" his own Akoin cryptocurrency. But the cryptocurrency has been plagued by its own delays and struggles. 
""It wasn't being managed properly,"" he concedes. ""I take full responsibility for that.""
Before launching his Akoin cryptocurrency, the Akoin website announced a pre-sale opportunity called the Token of Appreciation (TOA) campaign. 
mpaign was announced over two years before the Akoin cryptocurrency itself was available. It was a fundraiser to cover the costs of launching Akoin later down the line.  
Money sent for TOAs was framed as a ""donation"" on the Akoin TOA website page but there was a special incentive to put money in during this period. Contributors were told that for every $1 they put in they would receive up to four Tokens of Appreciation which would later convert to proper Akoin.
""I did genuinely believe in the ecosystem that they were looking to build,"" says Marcus (not his real name) who lives in the UK. ""Every now and again I'd put in a few thousand pounds.""
ken of Appreciation campaign concluded in October 2019. The official Akoin Twitter feed claimed it had raised $290,000. Over two years later TOA donors were presented with a choice in the official Akoin Telegram group.
""We're now able to give TOA holders a choice,"" wrote the admin. ""Receive a refund of their original donation or receive an Akoin MasterCard which will have the value of their initial donation.""
Some TOA donors have decided to wait for their promised rewards. For now they have notice of a Token of Appreciation but it doesn't have any functionality. Others have tried to claim their money back.
""I didn't ask for the refund, they offered the refunds,"" notes Marcus, whose faith in the project was starting to flag. ""The refund was meant to come a few weeks later. We are now over a year. And we're back at the same situation we were years ago with the lack of communication and now everybody's up in arms.""
Marcus is not alone. In the Akoin Telegram groups I've spoken to a number of other people around the world who say that they have asked for refunds but are still waiting to receive their money back. 
""It's extremely frustrating,"" says Reggie, an American living in Asia who also donated to the campaign. ""Yeah, I've gotten upset about this, you know, a number of times.""
I put cases like Marcus' and Reggie's to Akon, who denied knowing that donors to the Akoin campaign were still waiting for refunds. He claims he will get involved in rectifying the situation until TOA donors are happy. 
""Even if I gotta go in my own pocket,"" he adds. ""I'm dead serious. I would do a world tour just to pay them all back.""
Akon: 'I would do a world tour' to pay back crypto investors
Akoin cryptocurrency itself launched on Bitmart in September 2021. Its value at that time was £0.23 ($0.28) but it has fallen significantly since, preceding a crash in the wider cryptocurrency market. Today Akoin's price is just £0.01.
re have also been questions over whether it would even be legal for Akoin to operate as the primary payment method at Akon City.
urrent legal tender in Senegal is the CFA franc, which is regulated and issued by Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which share the money. Yahoo Finance reported last year that the ""institution warned of the dangers of adopting cryptocurrency and termed it illegal"". We approached the BCEAO to comment on the legality of a city running on cryptocurrency but they didn't respond. 
""Those are a lot of the concerns even I have,"" acknowledges Akon. ""I want to make sure that however we involve crypto within the city is in a way that it lines up with all the rules and regulations.""
So will ordinary transactions in Akon's proposed ""Crypto City"" still take place with his own crypto? It seems unclear. ""We'll have it figured out by the time the city's up, that's for sure,"" he promises.
But after two years of waiting, not everyone is convinced.
""I think a lot of us we've done our research but it panned out like nothing is going on,"" says Reggie. ""I would like to get my funds back and just walk away"".

politics	Keeping tips from workers could be illegal under new law	"Employers not paying workers their tips in their entirety, without deductions, may soon become illegal.
A bill sponsored by the Conservative MP for Ynys Môn, Virginia Crosbie, would also introduce an obligation to allocate tips fairly among workers.
UK government is backing the move and said it would benefit more than two million workers.
rade union Unite said it would reserve judgement until ""potential loopholes"" in the bill were closed.
Kristian Cuffin, 30, who owns the Cuffed In Coffee cafe in Holyhead, in Ms Crosbie's constituency, said he could not imagine not already giving his staff the entirety of their tips. 
""That's what they're intended for,"" he said. 
All tips at Mr Cuffin's cafe are split evenly among staff each week, with electronic tips logged in a report at the end of each day. 
""For us, I can imagine it's a lot easier because we all work fairly even hours. If somebody is working 40 hours and someone's only working five, then to distribute it evenly might not work.  
""I suppose it depends on your business. But for us, it's quite a simple process,"" he added.
Ms Crosbie took over responsibility for the bill when Dean Russell, the backbench MP who introduced it, became a minister.
She acknowledged that most employers were already ""doing the right thing,"" but said the bill would help ""create a level playing field"". 
Under the law, employees would also be given the right to view their employer's tipping record.
""It means that when somebody is in a restaurant or they're in a beauty bar or a taxi, and they pay a tip on their credit card, that this tip will go to the person that actually served them or helped them,"" she said. 
Currently, businesses who receive tips by card have the choice of whether to keep it or pass it on to workers. Cash tips, on the other hand, are legally the property of staff.
In 2021 the UK government said 80% of all tipping now happened by card and suggested this had made it easier for businesses to keep the funds.
Many of the jobs in the MP's constituency are in hospitality and tourism and she has been holding listening events with business owners and workers to help draw up a tipping code of conduct.
Rhys Taylor-Roberts, 20, who is one of six employees at Cuffed by Coffee, said he ""100%"" thinks the bill would be good news. 
""It increases your wage, it gives you more motivation to have better customer service, it's appreciation that's being shown for your craft,"" he said.
""A few pounds does make a difference, it pays for the little things so that you can save for the big things. Whether it's dinner or you're going to get a new haircut. It's like a top-up, a little help,"" he added.
Unite has previously said it was ""not confident"" the measures would address poor practices.
Its hospitality spokesman Dave Turnbull said it has now secured a commitment that ""potential loopholes"" would be closed. 
He added that the union would reserve its judgement until these changes ""see the light of day"". 
UK government first announced plans to ensure all tips go to workers in 2018, but these were never passed into law. 
A UK government official said: ""The Employment (Allocation of Tips) Bill, backed by the government, will ensure that all tips go to staff by making it unlawful to hold back service charges from employees.""
""More than two million UK workers will benefit, helping ease pressures caused by increases in the cost of living."""	/news/uk-wales-63431335

health	Strep A: Penarth family traumatised by daughter's death	"A doctor has warned parents to look out for Strep A symptoms
rents of a girl who died from Strep A say they have been left traumatised by her death.
Seven-year-old Hanna Roap, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, died from invasive Group A Streptococcal disease (iGAS), or Strep A.
Her father Hasan described her as a ""bubbly"" daughter, who was ""always smiling"" and said: ""We're just numb, we don't know what to do"".
Following her death, a multi-agency review has been put in place.
Across the UK eight children have died with an invasive form of the Strep A bacterial infection in recent months.
Strep A infections are usually mild, causing illness ranging from a sore throat to scarlet fever, but they can develop into a more serious invasive Group A Strep (iGAS) infection.
Public Health Wales said iGAS cases were rare in Wales and children have a low risk of contracting the disease.
PHW communicable disease control consultant Dr Graham Brown said: ""In very rare cases, group A streptococcal infection can cause iGAS, a rare complication which affects fewer than 20 children in Wales each year.
""Although iGAS is a worrying condition, the majority of these children will recover with proper treatment.""
In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Roap, 37, said his family is ""traumatised"" and ""devastated"".
He said his daughter came home from school on Thursday, 24 November with a mild cough. By the evening, her cough had got worse.
As she was struggling to sleep, he gave her an antihistamine and her inhaler in the hope that she would feel better if she ""slept it off"". 
However Hanna's condition had not improved when the family awoke, so her father took her to the GP, who prescribed steroids. 
Mr Roap said: ""My gut instinct is if she had antibiotics she would have been OK, but I'm not a medical professional, so I took what the GP said"".
At about 20:00 GMT that day, Mr Roap had left for work when his wife Salah called him to say Hanna had stopped moving. 
He rushed back and called an ambulance.
""I started doing CPR here but I wasn't able to revive her,"" he said, looking over at his daughter's bed. 
Within half an hour of the ambulance arriving, Hanna had been pronounced dead.
""I don't have all the information to hand so I can't pass judgment. I hope that everything is examined and checked correctly,"" he said.

r of Victoria Primary School, where Hanna was a pupil, has visited the family. 
A large number of people came to her funeral on Friday, which Mr Roap said reflected how much his daughter was loved.
""They didn't come for us, they came for her,"" he said.
""She was a bubbly character who was always up to mischief and it is dead silence now in the house.

Following the death, a procedural review of unexpected death in childhood will be taking place.
Public Health Wales has written to schools and nurseries in Wales to raise awareness of the symptoms and potential complications of scarlet fever following a rise of cases of scarlet fever across the UK.
An alert has also been sent to GPs, children's doctors and emergency wards to notify public health of any new cases.
Dr Rowena Christmas, who chairs the Royal College of GPs in Wales, said Strep A was common among children and will, on average, be present ""harmlessly"" in about a quarter of children.
""The tricky thing is, the way it presents initially is the same way that lots and lots of children are at the moment with those snotty, viral bugs,"" said Dr Christmas.
She said that there had been a decrease in cases of Strep A during the pandemic, probably due to increased emphasis on good hygiene and lack of contact with others. 
""We're careful with prescribing antibiotics because if we prescribe too many they'll be resistant, so we usually only prescribe them when we're really, really sure there's a bacterial infection.
""I think my threshold for prescribing them is definitely going to be a little bit lower in the next few weeks.""
Dr Christmas, a GP in Monmouth, added that her practice has been ""phenomenally busy"" in recent weeks, adding: ""I've certainly seen lots of small, hot, not very well little children.
""The things that parents should be aware of is if they see their child working harder with their breathing, or if they're not eating or drinking well, or if their behaviour is different so they're lethargic or miserable, those are the sorts of things that we'd be worried about and want to see""."	/news/uk-wales-63853197
entertainment	Owain Wyn Evans: Wales first for new BBC Radio 2 show	"Presenter Owain Wyn Evans will host the new early breakfast show on BBC Radio 2 from Cardiff. 
w will be the first Radio 2 weekday programme to move out of London.
w will come from the BBC Cymru Wales broadcast centre from January. 
Owain has taken over from Vanessa Feltz, who stepped down in July 2022, and he said: ""I can't wait to help kick start the day on early breakfast live from Cardiff"".
move forms part of the BBC's Across The UK plans, which the corporation said would allow it to ""better reflect, represent and serve all parts of the country"".
rogramme will be broadcast Monday to Friday, from 04:00 BST to 06:30.
Owain said: ""When I asked my parents for a pair of turntables and mixing desk from a DJ shop in Llanelli when I was 13, I never allowed myself to dream that one day I'd have my own show on Radio 2.""
He started working as a television and radio presenter when he was 18, beginning as a children's news presenter at BBC Wales, before moving to become a weather presenter across the UK.
A keen drummer since he was seven, he shot to international fame when, during lockdown in 2020, he produced a video of himself drumming to the BBC News theme tune, which was viewed tens of millions of times around the globe.
It was the springboard for the record-breaking 24-hour drumathon for Children in Need, which raised more than £3.8m, making it the most successful 24-hour challenge in the 41-year history of BBC Children in Need.
Helen Thomas, head of Radio 2, says: ""I'd like to welcome Owain to the Radio 2 family. 
""His deep connection with Wales is obvious and I'm delighted he will be broadcasting live from Cardiff every weekday morning.
""His warmth and wit make him the perfect host to set up the day for our listeners right across the country who have clearly and warmly taken him to their hearts each time he has presented in this slot."" 
Rhuanedd Richards, director of BBC Cymru Wales, said: ""I'm delighted that Radio 2 listeners will be starting their weekdays in Owain's company, live every weekday from BBC Wales' home in Cardiff's Central Square.
""Having started his career as a presenter here in Wales, it's wonderful news that he'll be taking to the airwaves from Cardiff, and waking listeners across the UK."""	/news/world-63134726
sports	Artistic swimming: Sport will not revert to synchronised swimming, despite protests	"Synchronised swimming will now be known as artistic swimming, despite an online campaign and protests from Russia's deputy prime minister. 
ge was agreed by swimming's world body Fina last week, prompting Vitaly Mutko, Russia's former sports minister, to ask: ""What is the point?""
He also suggested that the Russian Swimming Federation will still refer to the sport by the previous name. 
An online petition also had nearly 9,000 signatures on Thursday morning. 
Mutko added: ""To keep the name synchronised swimming is our right, and if the [Russian Swimming] Federation itself, the coaches will want it, we will do it.""
But Fina's executive chairman Cornel Marculescu said the decision will stand.
""Nothing changes, only the name, I don't see any great difficulty with that,"" he said. ""I understand the commentary of Mr Mutko but it's no problem, we talk about the same sport anyhow.""
Fina's congress voted to change the name to attract a wider audience to a sport that has recently expanded to include male competitors, and Marculescu says it will give the sport ""another dimension"".
However, an online petition on Change.org states that ""the name change will be more of a deterrent to males than a calling card""."	/sport/swimming/40738327
health	Scottish GP numbers drop and fewer working full-time	"umber of GPs in Scotland has seen a slight decrease in the past year, the latest figures show. 
Public Health Scotland statistics show there has been a drop of 23 fully-qualified GPs. On top of that, more doctors are working part-time hours. 
However, there was an increase of 55 GP trainees, which made the overall total headcount slightly more than last year.
Scottish government said it expected numbers to increase at a greater rate in the next five years.
figures show there are 5,209 GPs in Scotland, including GP trainees, up 32 on last year.
However, if trainees are excluded the number is 4,515, down on the 2021 figure.
A separate report estimated the ""whole time equivalent"" number is 3,494, down 3% on the 2021 figure.
A recent report said the reduction in WTE is likely to be the result of an increase in female GPs who are more likely to work part-time.
Women now make up 62% of the GP workforce in Scotland.
GP services are changing significantly in the face of staff shortages and struggles to meet demand. It has been happening for a while. 
re has been a decrease in the number of GP practices - down 9% since 2012, with 11 closing in the past year alone.  
Meanwhile the numbers of patients over 65, who need more medical care, has gone up 20% in the past decade.
Efforts are being made to train new GPs but the fear is that even if targets are met, it won't be enough.  
re's also been an expansion of general practice teams so you are more likely to see an advanced nurse practitioner, pharmacist or physiotherapist than a GP - but it's been hard to recruit them too. 
For patients that can mean people having to travel further to bigger medical centres.  
I visited a surgery in Scone had that 30 years ago had 6000 patients. Now it has 17,000.  
In other cases, health boards step in and try to find staff to run the service locally. 
Doctors say the move to bigger, more centralised services is not good for patients who lose the continuity of care. 
It increases the risk that things will be missed or there will be more referrals to hospitals which are already stretched. 
Meanwhile, a new report from the Royal College of General Practitioners in Scotland (RCGPS) has warned Scotland could face a shortage of 1,500 GPs within the next five years.
It said the lack of a long-term strategy to recruit more GPs and retain the existing workforce was leading to an unmanageable workload.  
RCGPS annual survey of members found 36% said they would be unlikely to be working in general practice in five years time, with many saying they planned to retire.
Increasing numbers said they would leave because it was too stressful.  
royal college wants the government and health boards to offer more support to family doctors to help cope with increased demand.  
Scone surgery in Perthshire has had to take on more patients as other practices have closed.
James Mowbrey, who has the chronic lung disease IPF, told BBC Scotland that sometimes he has to make more than 20 phone calls to get through. 
He said there have been times when he had put the phone down in ""exasperation"".
Dr David Shackles, who has worked at that practice for 29 years, said there were not enough GPs.
""We know that the whole time equivalent numbers have dropped by about 3%,"" he said.
""Headcount is often meaningless. It is how many GPs you have got working in the surgeries day-in day-out and how many you have got in the out of hours service.
""Our GPs are working incredibly hard 24/7. It is not just in-hour services.""
Dr Shackles, who is joint chair RCGP Scotland, said there were shortages in other services linked to general practice such as pharmacists and district nurses.
He said new innovations such as Hospital at Home often took away staff from other core services.
Dr Shackles said it takes 10 years to train a GP from when they begin medical school.
""We have not got 10 years,"" he said. ""So we have to look at an alternative and that is a retention model. 
""We know many GPs are retiring early because of the pressures but we are also losing people earlier in their career for the same reason.
""For some it is pressure or frustration but some people are moving abroad. We have got to do something to bring the joy back into general practice.""Health Secretary Humza Yousaf praised the work of GP at a time of significant challenge in the NHS.
He said the latest workforce figures showed good progress towards the commitment to increase the number of GPs by 800 by 2027. 
Mr Yousaf said additional places at medical school would mean more GPs would begin to feed through in the next few years.
He said: ""We are aware that the number of patients registered with GP practices continues to rise slowly year on year and the number of patients aged 65 and over has increased by 20% since 2012.""
retary said funding had increased and there were more healthcare professionals to support GPs.
Other Public Health Scotland statistics released on Tuesday show the worst performance on record against the 62-day target for cancer referrals.`
wed that in the three months from July to September about 1,050 patients waited longer than 62 days to start treatment following an urgent suspected cancer referral.   
report showed that only 74.7% of patients were seen within the target time.
Cancer Research UK's public affairs manager in Scotland, David Ferguson, said the figures were ""extremely worrying"". "	/news/uk-scotland-63955169
entertainment	Gary Lineker tweet broke impartiality rules, says BBC complaints unit	"Gary Lineker broke BBC impartiality rules in a tweet about the Conservative Party, the corporation has ruled.
In February, the Match of the Day host posted a story about then-Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urging a boycott of the Champions League final in Russia.
He added: ""And her party will hand back their donations from Russian donors?""
BBC's Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) has upheld a complaint and said Lineker's post ""did not meet the BBC's editorial standards on impartiality"".
former England striker declined to comment on the decision.
ECU said Lineker was ""one of the BBC's highest profile stars"" and, although not required to uphold the same high standards of impartiality as the broadcaster's journalists, does have an ""additional responsibility"" because of his profile.
""We expect these individuals to avoid taking sides on party political issues or political controversies and to take care when addressing public policy matters,"" the ruling said.
It explained that Lineker had pointed out that the tweet was prompted by an article about football, his primary area of expertise, and the board accepted it was intended as a comment on the sport rather than politics.
BBC Sport managers also pointed out that he framed his tweet in the form of a question, rather than a statement of opinion on a politically controversial matter.
However, the ECU concluded that the post was intended to highlight a ""perceived inconsistency in the Conservative Party's approach, at a time when relations between the UK and Russia were the subject of significant public debate"".
Lineker's tweet came as Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, and just before European footballing body Uefa moved the Champions League final from St Petersburg to Paris as a result.
ECU said its ruling had been discussed with Lineker and BBC Sport managers. "	/news/entertainment-arts-63248314
entertainment	Stormzy: Mel Made Me Do It 'celebrates black British excellence'	"He's back.
After three years without a solo release - Stormzy dropped his new single Mel Made me Do It with a powerful, 10-minute music video on Thursday night.
It stars a range of black British icons, from Dave to Little Simz, as well Brenda Edwards, mother of late music producer Jamal.
Cameos from sport, musical and cultural heroes have been called ""a celebration of Black British excellence"".
rack has been an instant hit - racking up more than one million Youtube views in less than 24 hours.
And many black British people have been heaping praise upon Stormzy's latest.
Afolabi spoke to BBC Newsbeat about his own reaction.
""I still struggle to call myself a black Brit. I grew up here all my life and I have strong ties here, but I'm also Nigerian"" says Afolabi.
""There are times when this country will remind you that we're not wanted and it makes me glad that I'm Nigerian because I have a community that I can still relate to,"" says the 29-year-old.
""However, Stormzy's video really made me proud to call myself a black Brit.""
Afolabi was particularly excited to see all the stars in the video - from talk show hosts to football managers.
""Take Ian Wright as an example,"" he says. 
""He's a legend that faced adversity and got into professional football at a late age and still succeeded.""
Afolabi also names Jenny Francis - who ""provided joy for so many of us"" - and Noughts and Crosses author Malorie Blackman as personally significant appearances.
In the music video Malorie walks alongside another author, Jade LB, who wrote the award winning book - Keisha the Sket. Jade told Newsbeat last year that she's an ""advocate"" for telling stories from ""marginalised communities"".
""These people and so many more played a part in shaping me and our struggles and our joy are similar in one way or another and that for me is what truly makes us black British,"" says Afolabi.
rack is named after Melissa Holdbrook-Akposoe, better know as influencer Melissa's Wardrobe - Stormzy's stylist and CEO of It's a Lifestyle Hun.
Her impact has been highlighted on social media as well.
""Understanding Melissa's influence is not a surprise to me. I'm an invested fan so I was aware for a long time and has been aware of her affiliation with Big Mike,"" says Afolabi.
""When Stormzy was on Instagram, she was always on the stories and look at the amazing job she did for him at The Met Gala. The core of us have known of Melissa and her influence for a long time, the mainstream are just catching up.""

entertainment	Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You returns to UK number one	"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas in the UK singles chart, after Mariah Carey dethroned Taylor Swift from the number one spot.
All I Want For Christmas Is You tops the chart after being streamed 10.8 million times in the past week.
Another 23 festive favourites have also made the Top 40.
Carey's song, which is widely regarded as a modern-day standard, was first released in 1994, and reached number one for the first time in 2020.
Elsewhere in this week's chart, Wham's Last Christmas is at number three, with Ed Sheeran and Elton John's Merry Christmas one place behind.
Brenda Lee's Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree lands at number six, with perennial favourites like Merry Christmas Everyone, Fairytale Of New York and It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year appearing further down.
f Christmas hits has buried some of pop's biggest names - with Swift's Anti-Hero dropping to fifth place after six weeks in the top spot, and Lewis Capaldi's new single, Pointless, debuting at 20.
One artist has bucked the trend, however. Pop singer Raye has earned a career-best peak with her latest single Escapism, which has climbed to number two this week.
ger has previously written hits for the likes of Charli XCX and Little Mix, and found success as a featured artist on tracks by Jax Jones and David Guetta.
However, her solo material initially failed to catch fire in the same way, and last year she told fans her record label was refusing to release her album.
Now independent, she has found chart success in her own right thanks in part to TikTok, where her song's rebellious and relatable lyrics have inspired more than 150,000 videos.
""I feel on top of the world right now,"" she told the BBC. ""I could throw up. I feel like I'm in a simulation, it doesn't feel real.""
ger, who was named one to watch in the BBC's Sound Of 2017, said she hoped the success of Escapism would help people discover her album when it arrives in February.
""It's my first album, do you know what I mean? It's been 10 years since I released my first single and finally I get to put a body of work together,"" she said.
""I'm really proud of it. It's a very eclectic fusion of different feelings and sounds. I'm independent now, so I can do what I like.""
Christmas theme continues in this week's album chart, where Sir Cliff Richard's Christmas With Cliff is at number four, Michael Bublé's Christmas is at five, and Andre Rieu's Silver Bells is at six.
As Fleetwood Mac fans continue to mourn Christine McVie, two of the band's albums also appear in this week's top 20, with Rumours at 11 and greatest hits compilation 50 Years - Don't Stop at 15.
However, Olly Murs is the chart champion after his new record, Marry Me, debuted at number one.
It's the X Factor graduate's fifth number one, following In Case You Didn't Know (2011), Right Place Right Time (2012), Never Been Better (2014) and 24 HRS (2016).
""Wow, it's been six years since I had a number one, so thank you so much to all the fans, you lot have been absolutely amazing,"" said the singer in a statement.

technology	West Yorkshire Police: Receives 200 accidental emergency calls daily	"About 200 accidental 999 calls are being received by a police force every day.
West Yorkshire Police said pocket dialling and children playing on their parents' phones accounted for a number of the calls.
Staff said every emergency call needed investigation, sometimes requiring a personal visit, and misdials were adding to workloads.
force said it receives about 1,300 emergency calls a day.
Senior contact manager with the force, Tom Donahue, said the growing number of misdials came as they saw a 6% year-on-year rise in emergency calls.
""It can be very easy to pocket dial,"" Mr Donahue said.
""The problem for us is that every one of these calls needs to be investigated to make absolutely sure no-one is in danger.""
He said people were ""horrified and extremely apologetic"" once they were aware of the error.
Mr Donahue said it was also important people did not hang up if they realised they had dialled by mistake.
""A lot of the time parents of children who have dialled 999 accidentally will panic and hit 'end call'.
""We then have to ring them back.
""We would rather they stayed on the line and quickly told us everything was OK.""
When a caller dials 999, they are put through to the BT emergency operator who then directs calls to the most appropriate service.
BT does not have the resources to investigate all suspected misdials so they are put through to the police, Mr Donahue said.

business	Mortgage rates rise sharply as squeeze tightens	"Major mortgage lenders are increasing the cost of home loans, with the average two-year fixed rate now close to 6%, new figures show.
A typical two-year fixed mortgage deal is currently 5.75%, up from 4.74% on the day of the mini-budget, financial information service Moneyfacts said.
Lenders have been scrambling to reprice deals after the pound's fall fuelled forecasts of higher interest rates.
Mortgage rates have climbed since December as interest rates have risen.
In December, the average two-year fixed deal was 2.34%.
Fixed deal interest rates do not change during the term of the mortgage, so rates are quoted for new or renewing borrowers.
Lenders have also withdrawn hundreds of products in recent days, which may leave some borrowers with difficulties securing a deal. 
recently re-priced deals have tended to be from major lenders who want relatively low-risk borrowers. Those homeowners who have high debt levels, or who may have missed repayments on credit, may find their choice is much more limited in the short-term.
Brokers say there is still money available for mortgage providers to lend, but the days of ultra-low rates - typical of the last decade - have quickly disappeared.
""We did not expect that to happen quite so rapidly,"" one broker said.
Mortgage rates have been rising ever since the Bank of England began a series of seven consecutive rises in the Bank rate - the benchmark figure of interest rates. Rates then jumped after the mini-budget prompted widespread expectation of a faster and higher jump in the Bank rate in the coming months.
Lenders look at the long-term cost of borrowing, and potential demand, and try to stay a step ahead of the Bank of England when setting the rates for fixed rate deals.
Roughly 100,000 people a month come to the end of a fixed deal and often remortgage, while first-time buyers also sign up to fixed deals. The 1.5 million homeowners on variable or tracker deals often see their costs rise in direct response to a Bank rate rise.
A typical five-year fixed deal has been slightly cheaper than a two-year fixed deal for some time - but both are now seeing rates rise sharply.
""The normal rules of lending have changed,"" said Aaron Strutt of Trinity Financial.
Halifax - the UK's biggest mortgage lender - said it would launch its new, higher rates on Wednesday. 
""The new rates reflect the continued increase in mortgage market pricing over recent weeks,"" a spokesperson for Halifax said.
In recent days, other major lenders such as NatWest, Nationwide and Virgin Money have increased their rates.
NatWest did so on Sunday, a highly unusual day of the week to make a change, according to brokers, signalling the speed at which the market is changing.
A homeowner borrowing £200,000 on a 30-year mortgage may have been looking at a rate of 3.5% and a monthly repayment of £898 just over a week ago. Now, there are more likely to be facing a 5.5% rate and a monthly repayment of £1,135.
As always, there is uncertainty over the longer-term trend for mortgage rates. People will have to consider how much they can borrow, and what lenders will judge them to be able to afford.
Amid the turmoil of last week, lenders pulled deals off the shelf at unprecedented levels, with brokers saying deals were lasting for a very short period of time as people flooded them and lenders with enquiries.
Moneyfacts said that there were 3,961 deals available on the morning of the mini-budget, compared with 2,262 at the start of this week - a 43% fall. Products were last withdrawn quickly at the start of the pandemic, but not at such a level.
Many of deals were withdrawn by smaller, more specialist lenders. That may create added uncertainty for those with more chequered borrowing histories.

health	Ambulance strike: Poor pay impacting our health, says worker	"Poor pay is affecting the health and wellbeing of some ambulance workers and their ability to do the job, according to one worker.
Ian James, 59, said voting in favour of strike action was difficult, but necessary to improve conditions.
GMB members of the ambulance service in Wales are striking on Wednesday in a dispute over pay.
Wales' health minister said people should only call 999 for serious emergencies during the strike.
Mr James is an emergency medical technician and has worked for the ambulance service for 30 years, as well as serving as a branch secretary for the union.
He cited examples of colleagues who at one time were able to have ""fresh vegetables and food on a regular basis to now having less quality foods - even to the point where some members of staff are having to use food banks"".
""That does seriously impact on your ability to function at the highest level, which you need when dealing with patients, the public, drugs, driving,"" he added.
""All those things are impacted by your health and wellbeing.""
Members of the GMB union - which makes up about a quarter of the ambulance service in Wales - are striking for 24 hours, ending at midnight on Wednesday. 
Welsh government has given workers an average pay rise of 4.75%, but with inflation running at more than 10%, unions say this represents a pay cut in real terms. 
Unison did not meet the threshold for industrial action in Wales, though it's expected to re-ballot its members in the new year, while the results of Unite's ballot is due later this week.
In England all three unions are taking action, though bosses in Wales are also preparing for non-GMB members to strike in support.
Calls to the service will still be answered and the most urgent, life-threatening calls - roughly 15% of the total call volume - will be responded to.
xpectation is that many patients - even those who are seriously ill - will simply not get an ambulance response.
Exemptions are also in place so that should the most urgent ""red calls"" come in, bosses can ask for striking crews to return to work, though staff can refuse.
At Pentwyn service station in Cardiff, all striking members were called away from the picket line on emergency calls.
Handover delays are often lengthy, Mr James said.
""The public can be assured that no life or limb would be put in jeopardy from a patient being left on the back of an ambulance, that will not happen,"" he explained.
""We would hand over that patient as safe and securely as possible.""
He said the current pressures on the service meant there were reduced opportunities to mentally process what they deal with, which in turn is affecting how long staff stay in the service.
""People put a brave face on a lot of things they do, particularly with the ambulance service, where they are dealing with catastrophic incidents on a regular basis.
""It used to be that you would 'depressurise' on station, but now handovers are so difficult that as soon as you come through that door they're looking to cover jobs.
""So you're straight on the vehicle, checking your equipment and straight out that door. You don't get the 'depressurisation' that we used to have.""
Sharon Thorpe, a relief paramedic for the Welsh Ambulance Service in Newport, called the action a ""necessity"" to preserve the service for patients.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, she said: ""Actually putting that tick in that box for action was a massive decision for me.
""This is my 30th year in the ambulance service. We've had ballots before, and I've never ticked that box before, [but] there has been years of underfunding in the health service and its staff.
""To help people in their darkest times and then go home and possibly have to visit a foodbank to feed your children is unacceptable."" 
Ms Thorpe, a picket supervisor supporting striking colleagues, added: ""I don't think there is one of us here today who feels good about this, but it's a necessity. People in the NHS are the service, and the service will last as long as there are people to fight for it. 
""The service that we give our patients is, at the moment, not fulfilling what we would want. Patient experience is dire, staff are struggling. Things have to change.""
Richard Collyer, an emergency medical technician and GMB Union lead in Carmarthenshire, added that the current wage was having ""a massive effect on ourselves and our families financially because we can't support them as well as we should be"".
""I get paid £11.24 an hour. For the work that we do and the lives that we save and the trauma and the horrific things that we see on a daily basis, £11.24 is not enough.""
He added that the decision to walk out had been taken with ""a very heavy heart"".
Jason Killens, head of the Wales Ambulance Service, said about half of crews were working normally overnight and the other half were responding only to top tier emergencies or taking full strike action.
He added: ""Pressure on the service has been sustained and has been extreme for many months. Today, so far, we've seen activity perhaps be slightly kinder than we've seen in recent weeks."" 
He said while pleas for hospitals to free up ambulances quickly had been met, the impact was still significant.
""Patients are likely to continue to come to some degree of harm during the strike action. But the issue for us over the last few days has been planning as best we can for today to mitigate the impact of the action,"" he said. 
He suggested that factors beyond pay, such as workplace environment, long handover delays outside hospitals and late finishes had influenced some workers' decisions and urged unions and ministers to ""get round the table"".
""I do have sympathy with them for the circumstances they're working in. It is deeply frustrating for them and for me because we can't provide the service that people need,"" he added.
Welsh government said about 2,800 outpatient appointments and 250 planned operations were postponed in Wales on Tuesday.
It said that did not reflect the full impact on planned NHS care, as fewer operations and appointments were booked in than normal.
Health Minister Eluned Morgan said people should not add extra pressure on services on strike days and consider carefully what activities they take part in.
""There's no doubt the two days of industrial action, following hard on the heels of action by nurses which have caused a delay in treatment for thousands of patients in Wales, are going to cause huge pressure on ambulance services. Ambulances will only be able to respond to the most urgent calls on strike days,"" she said.
""It's important to call 999 if you are in immediate danger, but we must all consider very carefully how we use ambulance services on these days.""

entertainment	Young rapper seeking asylum in UK shares his story	"Mustafa recorded three rap songs with West Berkshire Council's 16 Plus and Leaving Care Team
An 18-year-old asylum seeker sharing his experiences through rap music has said he wants to inspire people ""to never give up"".
Mustafa came to Thatcham, in West Berkshire, from Sudan in 2020 and is supported by West Berkshire Council's 16 Plus and Leaving Care Team.
""Firstly, I came here to be safe, secondly I came here to achieve all my goals,"" he said.
Mustafa started rapping as part of a council programme.
He said: ""I rap about my life, the situation of my country and sometimes motivational songs.""
Mustafa has been supported by the local authority to create his own music in a studio, recording three songs in English so far, and performing in front of 100 people at a showcase. 
""I want to be a rapper,"" he told the BBC. ""I was listening [to rap music] in Sudan when I was young.""

health	Nottingham hospital menopause scheme hailed by staff	"Hospital staff in Nottingham have said they are keen to build on the success of its menopause support scheme. 
Nottingham University Hospitals Trust (NUH) said 24% of its staff were aged 45-55, the most common age for the condition.
Staff can ask for lighter uniforms, shift changes, more time to complete tasks or access to fans in offices.
Advice, awareness training and access to specialist staff are also part of the scheme.
menopause refers to when periods stop due to lower hormone levels.
Classic symptoms include hot flushes, broken sleep and brain fog.
ff wellbeing team at NUH said they were ""inundated"" with messages from colleagues who were struggling.
rust was the first in the country to be awarded the Menopause Friendly Employer Accreditation and this year was a finalist in the Most Menopause Friendly Environment category in the first Menopause Friendly Employer Award scheme.
Jenny Good, NUH Staff Wellbeing Lead, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""We strongly believe that menopause is an issue for everybody. Everyone knows somebody who will go through it.
""We wanted to equip everyone who works at NUH with an awareness of what menopause is.
""We're really proud that we're the first NHS trust to get the accreditation.
""The conversation has opened up.""
Rachel Meadwell, a ward administrator at Queen's Medical Centre, said: ""There is a lot of taboo around menopause and lack of understanding.
""So since we've had the accreditation I now realise it's happening to a massive proportion of the workforce. It's now an open conversation and that's great.
""I've got a paper fan at all times to keep me cool but I've got an industrial fan in the office now.

politics	SNP minister Ash Regan resigns over gender recognition plans	"An SNP minister has resigned over Scottish government plans to make it easier for someone to change their legally-recognised gender. 
Ash Regan quit as community safety minister, saying her conscience would not allow her to support the plans. 
Her resignation came hours ahead of the gender recognition reform bill being passed in principle at Holyrood.
Seven SNP MSPs voted against and two abstained in the biggest rebellion since the party came to power.
It was also the first time an SNP minister had quit over government policy since 2007 but, despite the dissent, the stage 1 vote at Holyrood saw it comfortably passed by 88 to 33 with four abstentions. 
ms to speed up the time it takes to obtain a gender recognition certificate (GRC) and drops the requirement for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria.
It also lowers the age for obtaining a GRC from 18 to 16.
Scottish government argues the changes would make the process simpler and less traumatic, but the proposals are controversial with some arguing it would undermine women's rights and safety. 
SNP politicians who voted against were: Stephanie Callaghan, Fergus Ewing, Kenny Gibson, Ruth Maguire, John Mason, Ash Regan and Michelle Thomson. Annabelle Ewing and Jim Fairlie abstained. 
Scottish Conservatives allowed their MSPs a free vote, with many voting against, while Scottish Labour said it would support the general principles but would seek amendments at a later stage.
Nine MSPs failing to vote with the government whip is the largest rebellion in the SNP's 15-year history in government.
rtainly the biggest policy rift since splits over Nato membership saw two MSPs quit to sit as independents in 2012 - and that was over a conference vote, not one in parliament.
It's not entirely clear what will happen to the rebel MSPs now, because there isn't much of a precedent. This has just never been an issue for the SNP whips office before.
Overall though, the bill has still passed its first parliamentary hurdle in very comfortable fashion.
ry comes at the immediate cost of a minister, and Ms Regan may provide a focal point for dissent within the SNP over gender reforms.
But this vote underlines that those changes are going to happen.
Ms Regan was one of 15 senior SNP politicians - including current Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and Business Minister Ivan McKee - who signed a letter in 2019 urging the Scottish government not to ""rush"" into ""changing the definition of male and female"".
In her resignation letter, she said:  ""I have considered the issue of Gender Recognition Reform very carefully over some time. I have concluded that my conscience will not allow me to vote with the government at the Stage 1 of the Bill this afternoon. 
""Consequently, I am writing to resign my position in the Scottish government as minister for community safety.  I have greatly valued the opportunity over the last few years to work in government with colleagues to build a better Scotland.""
She later tweeted that she believed the legislation ""may have negative implications for the safety and dignity of women and girls"". 
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she accepted the resignation, but said Ms Regan had not approached her to raise her concerns. 
She said:  ""I note that at no stage have you approached me - or indeed the cabinet secretary for social Justice - to raise your concerns about the Gender Recognition Reform Bill or the vote this evening.
""However, in circumstances in which a minister is unable to support the government, it is the case that the only options available are resignation ahead of the vote or dismissal thereafter. I therefore accept your resignation.""
Scottish government argues the bill would streamline a process that is currently invasive and distressing for an already marginalised minority group. 
Presently, people must apply to a UK gender recognition panel, provide two medical reports as well as proof of having lived in their acquired gender for at least two years. They must also swear an oath that they intend to live in that gender for the rest of their lives. 
w bill would retain the requirement to swear an oath - with potential prosecution for false statements.  They would need to live in their acquired gender for three months, followed by a three-month ""reflection period"" before a certificate was issued, and applications would be handled by the Registrar General for Scotland.
Some campaigners, however, believe that allowing people to ""self-identify"" could have an impact on rights that women have fought for decades to secure. There is also concern about the impact on women-only spaces, including changing rooms, hospitals and refuges. 
One of the most high profile opponents of the proposed changes has been the Harry Potter author JK Rowling who says that her life has been ""shaped by being female"" and that ""removing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives"".
Ms Rowling recently supported a demonstration against the bill by tweeting a picture of herself wearing a T-shirt describing Nicola Sturgeon as a ""destroyer of women's rights"". 
Scottish Conservatives urged other parties to allow their MSPs a free vote on the legislation when it returns to parliament. 
rty's equalities spokesperson Rachael Hamilton said: ""Despite the SNP's attempt to whip their members into a united front, it's clear that many of their own MSPs are deeply worried about these proposals.
""The fact that nine SNP members felt compelled to rebel against this controversial legislation shows the seriousness of the objections held by MSPs right across the chamber."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63416857

mpany, which also owns the Picturehouse chain in the UK, is struggling under $5bn worth of debt.
Like other cinema chains, Cineworld was hit hard by the pandemic.
Cineworld recently said post-Covid customers levels were lower than expected and blamed ""limited"" film releases.
Wall Street Journal reported that Cineworld is preparing to file for bankruptcy, sending its share price tumbling. 
Cineworld has been contacted for comment.
firm had hoped blockbusters such as the latest Bond film, Top Gun: Maverick and Thor: Love And Thunder would draw audiences back after Covid restrictions.
But it said earlier this week: ""Despite a gradual recovery of demand since reopening in April 2021, recent admission levels have been below expectations.
""These lower levels of admissions are due to a limited film slate that is anticipated to continue until November 2022 and are expected to negatively impact trading and the group's liquidity position in the near term.""
Cineworld has 9,189 screens across more than 750 sites.
It operates in 10 countries, including the UK, the US, Poland and Israel, and employs more than 28,000 people. 
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Cineworld had ""failed to lure back enough movie goers to help pay back its enormous debts"".
""Hopes had been raised that first spies, then superheroes, then fighter pilots would prove to be the magic bullets for the company but there simply haven't been enough blockbusters coming through to to break the spell of misfortune,"" she said.
But Peter Williams, a former non-executive director at Cineworld, told the BBC he thought cinema ticket prices were ""too low"".
""I've always felt that the ticket price or headline ticket price is almost too low really. I mean, it is still a very cheap night out,"" he said.
He added that while Cineworld is likely to face a major restructure, he believed that it would emerge as ""a viable business"".

ma giant warned in September 2020 that it might need to raise more money in the event of further coronavirus restrictions or film delays due to Covid-19.
Analysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter
Jurassic World Dominion, Top Gun: Maverick, Doctor Strange, Elvis and Minions: The Rise of Gru are among the major releases that have kept audiences coming through the doors at a time when cinemas are desperate to bounce back from their Covid losses. 
But Cineworld's owner argues there still haven't been enough to keep them afloat. They say their admissions are down because Hollywood has released fewer major films than would have been typical in a pre-pandemic summer. Total box office takings this year are down a third, or 32%, compared with the equivalent period in 2019.
umber of releases isn't the only factor. Streaming services have posed a threat to cinemas for many years, and the battle for content has become even more aggressive recently.
Netflix has spent hundreds of millions of pounds making films like The Gray Man and Red Notice, and releasing them straight into subscribers' homes. 
As a result, cinemas have had to fight harder to convince customers that leaving their couch to see a movie is worthwhile. 
utumn and winter release schedule provides some hope - sequels to the hugely successful Black Panther and the even more successful Avatar will be released between now Christmas.

technology	Russia-linked cyber attack could cost Gloucester City Council £1m	"A cyber attack linked to Russian hackers could cost the council £1m to fix, leaders have warned.
Benefit payments, planning applications and house sales were delayed after Gloucester City Council's IT systems were compromised in December.
uthority had to rebuild all of its servers after malware infected its systems.
Officers have been working to restore services but costs keep rising, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
rmful software was embedded in an email which had been sent to a council officer.
Known as sleeper malware, it is understood to have been dormant for some time before it was activated.
Following the attack, Gloucester City Council said its sources alleged the cyber attack was carried out by hackers from Russia.
Liberal Democrat group leader Jeremy Hilton asked councillors on 29 September how much it had cost so far to restore the IT systems and what the estimated final bill would be.
""Every time I ask the question about the costs of the cyber attack recovery, the cost rises more and more. 
""It now stands at a whopping £787,000.
""Can you reassure members of the council that the final bill will not be more than £1m?""
Deputy leader of the council Hanna Norman (Cons) told the meeting she could not give that assurance.
She said all parties involved in the recovery were doing it in the most cost effective manner because they were spending Gloucester taxpayers' money.
""I can give you the assurance that every penny we spend is scrutinised and we are making decisions based on value for money and what is right operationally for this authority and therefore Gloucester residents.""
She confirmed the council had spent £787,000 spent to date, of which £142,000 went on capital works.

politics	Scotland gender reforms: PM says reasonable for UK to look at law	"Rishi Sunak has said it is ""completely reasonable"" for the UK government to examine Scottish reforms making it easier for people to change gender. 
Scottish Parliament voted to lower the age when people can apply to change their legal gender to 16, and remove the need for a medical diagnosis.
But this has prompted a clash with the UK government who have concerns over safety for women and children. 
Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish government says it will fight attempts to stop it.
On Thursday, members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) voted by 86 votes to 39 to approve the controversial self-identification system, which makes it easier for people to obtain a gender recognition certification (GRC). 
UK government could prevent the legislation becoming law by blocking Royal Assent - when the Bill gets formal agreement by the King and becomes an Act of the Scottish Parliament. It has also not ruled out mounting a legal challenge. 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said many people in Scotland had concerns about the bill.
While visiting a homeless shelter in London, he said: ""I think it is completely reasonable for the UK government to have a look at it, understand what the consequences are for women and children's safety in the rest of the UK, and then decide on what the appropriate course of action is.""
Scottish Secretary Alister Jack warned: ""We will look closely at that, and also the ramifications for the 2010 Equality Act and other UK-wide legislation, in the coming weeks - up to and including a Section 35 order stopping the Bill going for Royal Assent if necessary.""
Under UK law, the UK government can apply to have Scottish laws struck down by arguing they would conflict with UK-wide equalities legislation. This power has not been used before.
But a spokesman for the Scottish government warned that any attempt by Westminster ""to undermine the democratic will of the Scottish Parliament will be vigorously contested"".
Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Scotland's Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said the Scottish government was very confident of its position.
She added: ""The bill as passed is absolutely within legislative competence and of course was backed by an overwhelming majority with support from all parties. 
""It would be unfortunate to say the least of the UK government were to go down this road.""
Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton told the programme he would be ""dismayed"" if the UK government chose to block the bill.
""I think it's inevitable that this bill will end up in court in one way or another but I am confident that we have given it the diligence and scrutiny and tested it in Parliament to ensure it will withstand any court challenge,"" he added.
Previously, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she would ""never apologise for trying to spread equality, not reduce it, in our country"".
Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill's opponents, including nine SNP MSPs who voted against it, have fears over its potential impact on women and girls, in particular single-sex spaces, like toilets. 
Scottish government insists little will change and exceptions barring trans people from single-sex space in some circumstances in the Equality Act will stand. 
Dr Michael Foran, a lecturer in public law at Glasgow University, highlighted how there was a section in the bill which says it will not change any provisions in the Equality Act - and for that reason it is probably within Holyrood's competence.
But he said this did not mean the bill had not changed the law ""as it relates to the Equality Act"".
He explained: ""One of the protected characteristics is sex and if they change who can be covered under one category of sex vs the other that could have an effect on how the Equality Act operates. That's quite a technical legal argument but it would open the door for challenges.""
Meanwhile Helen Belcher, head of charity Trans Actual which campaigns for trans rights, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme the Scottish law would not affect the Equality Act.
""The Equality Act is not within the Scottish Parliament's jurisdiction to change,"" she said. 
She added that trans rights should not be restricted ""on the basis of a few people"" who could take advantage of reforms to the law.
""It won't come as a shock to your listeners that criminals do nasty things, criminals break the law. But that's not necessarily a reason to prevent trans people from being treated with a bit of respect,"" she said.
g of controversial gender reform laws receive mixed reaction in the Scottish Parliament
People in Scotland have been able to change their legal gender from male to female or female to male since 2005.
Scottish government believes the existing process can be intrusive and distressing and put people off applying for a Gender Recognition Certificate.
w rules, which are expected to come into force some time next year, will mean applicants will now only need to have lived in their acquired gender for three months - or six months if they are aged 16 and 17 - rather than two years.
re will be also be a three-month ""reflection period"" during which they can change their minds and it will be a criminal offence to make a false declaration or false application for a GRC, with anyone who does so potentially facing up to two years in prison.
It will be possible to de-transition by going through the process again.
Nine other European countries have already adopted self-declaration systems for legal gender recognition, including the Irish Republic, Denmark, Norway, Portugal and Switzerland.
Also on Thursday, Spain passed a bill bringing it a step closer to allowing people to change their officially registered gender by filling in a form."	/news/uk-64073323

business	Recession: Is it as bad as it sounds?	"Is the UK in recession? Probably. Does that matter?  Well, it may sound callous, but... not really.
No-one loses their job because the statistics tell us we're in a recession, or heading for one.
What matters is how an economic downturn affects people and not statistics. And you're probably wondering how it affects you, your employer or your business. While it will be very tough for a minority of people, where they lose jobs or businesses fold, the chances are that you'll be OK.
In a recession, weaker companies fail and people are put out of work. That can be because sales revenue drops, so that they can't meet their costs including the servicing of their debts. It can be because the market they're in is in decline, and they have failed to make a move into growing markets.
But most firms battle through and survive, some with reduced revenue, many with losses or reduced profits, and often with reduced employment. Some can even thrive. It's a good time to be an insolvency practitioner.
Survivor businesses can come out the other side in a leaner, more efficient shape, and in a position to pick up the market share vacated by those that haven't made it through.
Recessions and redundancies also have a happier habit of sparking companies into life. Some of the world's biggest tech giants were born in recessions.
So while there is a lot of attention paid to Gross Domestic Product, it matters as a gauge of where the economy has recently been, and how different sectors have been faring in comparison with each other.
Office for National Statistics says it is in touch with around 40,000 businesses every fortnight, using real-time surveys.  It is as thorough a survey of economic activity as we have.
But boiling down those surveys to one number - in this case a drop in output of 0.2% in the third quarter of this year, July, August and September - does not tell you how your business or employer is placed.
Putting two of these numbers together can give economists what they call a recession.
We won't know if this downturn can be given that name for another three months, but the signs are that the quarter we're now in - October to December - will see a contraction in output.  If so, that will be the second consecutive quarter of declining output from across the economy.
So in mid-February next year, we may find that we have been in a recession since last July. It is a backward-looking indicator of the economy's strength or weakness.
And the number reflects what you can already see around you, as people and businesses have changed their behaviour.  
Firms judge more forward-looking indicators to see how demand might change. If they can foresee tough times ahead in their sector, they pull back on investment, which they have been doing, and perhaps recruitment, of which more later. 
For those that look to the ""golden quarter"" leading up to the festive season to make the profit that can often keep them going through the rest of the year, decisions about stock levels had to be made by late summer.
People also adapt their behaviour.  We have heard recently from the property sector that there has been a cooling of house price inflation. Even though supply of homes into the market is well below demand, those bidding to buy are being more cautious.
most recent Royal Bank of Scotland recruitment survey reflects a fall last month in the number of permanent placements, and the first fall in temporary placements in more than two years. Recruiters may be pulling back, out of caution about what lies ahead, but more significant, the number of people looking to move jobs has fallen.  Workers tend to hunker down with what they know when things are getting tough, rather than taking risks. 
And if you have responded to rising energy bills by cutting back on expenditure elsewhere, as most of us have, this is not a result of being in a recession. Repeated in millions of homes across the country, that shift in spending, allied to lowered confidence in job security, is the cause of the recession. 
In other words, recession is not like a gathering storm that builds up somewhere else and breaks over the economy: instead, it reflects the economic decisions we can see all around us and which many of us are already making with our own finances.
So, while recessions are not catastrophes, but a normal part of the economic cycle resulting from lots of rational decisions that we ourselves are making, there are aspects of the one we're (probably) currently in that look different. Here are three.
Bank of England's assessment is that the recession began in the middle of this year, and will run through next year into the middle of 2024 - the longest recession since the were first published, nearly a century ago.
It says that it will be relatively shallow. The last two downturns we've seen have been exceptionally steep and sharp - in 2008, with a property crash leading to a financial and banking crisis, and in 2020 with the sudden jolt of a lockdown due to Covid.
financial crash left deeper scars than previous recessions, in that the banks are often the drivers of growth out of a recession, and in this case, they were badly damaged, squeezing their business clients hard, and being told to rein back on new risky lending.
What worked well, in that case, was that they were under pressure not to repossess homes where people could not afford mortgage payments. Previous recessions had seen that happen, it pushed down property prices, and worsened the short-term downturn.  However, very low interest rates since then have encouraged more lending for house purchase, pushing prices up relative to earnings and ability to pay.
Businesses have also enjoyed a long holiday from costly finance, and with interest rates rising again, some of those who took risks on debt will be left exposed.  
ONS's head of statistics told the BBC Today programme that he is surprised that 4% of firms say rising interest rates are their primary concern. They are more concerned for now about rising energy and supply costs.
September figures do not tell us much about the effects of the notorious Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget, which provoked a market spike in borrowing costs. We are more likely to see that reverberate through the October figures, to be published a month from now.
A second difference in this recession is that the jobs market starts out exceptionally tight. In other recessions, jobs are shed as companies try to cut costs or as they go bust. Often, those job cuts come later in a recession or after it has, technically, ended.
Economic orthodoxy tells us that the threat of job losses has a moderating effect on demand for higher pay.
's not evident from the current spate of strikes and threatened strikes, probably because those union members do not see their own jobs as being threatened - most are in the public sector - or they judge that employers are able to pay more than they are offering.
Unemployment is forecast by the Bank of England to rise from very low levels, just above 3% of the workforce in Scotland and just above that for the whole UK, to more than 6% across the UK.
So those calculations on pay and industrial action may yet change. For now, however, recruiters continue to search out people for vacancies, pushing up pay to do so, and taking on apprentices.
r big difference with the financial and the Covid downturns is the response from the central bank and the government.
In a typical recession, central banks cut interest rates to help borrowers get through and stimulate investment coming out the other side. But this time, with inflation to be controlled, rates are on the way up.
Also in the past two downturns, the UK government used its spending power to boost demand, aiming to counteract the contraction. That has been the orthodox response since the devastating effects of doing the opposite in the 1930s.
In 2009, VAT was cut from 17.5% to 15% (the rate on most goods was later raised to its current 20% level), £3bn of government spending on capital projects, such as roads and buildings, was brought forward, businesses were given more time to pay tax bills, and there was a ""cash for bangers"" scheme encouraging people to replace polluting older cars with cleaner new ones.
In 2020, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, opened the spending taps with the furlough scheme and support for self-employed people, with a huge programme of grants and loans for business, and the big boost necessary to get the NHS through the crisis, including (some very questionable) spend on personal protective equipment. He followed up with the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, subsidising restaurant meals for a month.
In both cases, the government faced a steep drop in tax revenue, and opted to borrow on a big scale. This time, following the fiasco of the mini-budget in September, there is pressure to bring borrowing down as a share of national income. And without growth for a forecast two years, expansion of the economy is not going to help ease that ratio.
So this time, we see a UK government stuck between the orthodox response to a recession, which is to borrow and spend to counteract it, and the market pressure and conventional Conservative approach, which is to cut borrowing and the scale of government.
We'll find out next Thursday how Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, intends to resolve that tension. If he cuts spending and raises tax too sharply in the next two years, he could worsen and lengthen the recession. Removing or sharply cutting the Energy Price Guarantee after next March would contribute to that. 
Also for political reasons, he's more likely to save the harsher stuff until after the next Westminster election, which must take place by the end of 2024."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63596804

technology	YouTube joins Facebook in banning Andrew Tate	"YouTube has banned influencer Andrew Tate for violating its policies.
Google-owned social media site took action following Meta's decision to ban Mr Tate from Facebook and Instagram.
former kickboxer rose to fame in 2016 when he was removed from TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to depict him attacking a woman.
He went on to gain notoriety online - with Twitter banning him for saying women should ""bear responsibility"" for being sexually assaulted.
At the time of his removal from Big Brother, in 2016, Mr Tate said the controversial video had been edited, calling it ""a total lie trying to make me look bad"". 
Google, which owns YouTube, told the BBC: ""We terminated channels associated with Andrew Tate for multiple violations of our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service, including our hate speech policy. 
""If a channel is terminated, the uploader is unable to use, own or create any other YouTube channels.""
Mr Tate's YouTube channels had more than a million followers between them.
kTok has also banned an account belonging to Mr Tate as part of an ongoing investigation to remove content that violates its policies.
A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC: ""Misogyny is a hateful ideology that is not tolerated on TikTok.
""We've been removing violative videos and accounts for weeks, and we welcome the news that other platforms are also taking action against this individual.""
On Instagram, Tate had 4.7 million followers at the time his account was removed. That number had grown rapidly from around one million followers in June.
Meta said it had removed the kickboxing star from its platforms for violating its policies on dangerous organisations and individuals, but did not provide further details.
BBC has approached Mr Tate for comment.
By Marianna Spring, disinformation and social media correspondent
Andrew Tate's videos - promoting misogyny and targeting women - have come to prominence this summer, with many teens commenting on just how much he's appearing on their social media feeds. 
His content has raised concerns about the real-world effect it could have, especially on the younger users exposed to it during their school holidays when they have time on their hands.
focus has been primarily on TikTok, where users say they've been readily served up his videos - sparking a new wave of videos commenting on and criticising Mr Tate's content. 
YouTube has also found itself under pressure, since it's where he has racked up millions of views.
I revealed how social media sites promote anti-women hate for BBC Panorama. The investigations exposed how some platforms' algorithms were recommending more and more misogyny to a troll account. 
Since then, several sites have made commitments to better protect female users. But, once again, questions are being raised about the role social media sites play in pushing anti-women content. 
Mr Tate has drawn criticism online for his comments, particularly from UK advocacy group Hope Not Hate, which welcomed Meta's ban last week.
Joe Mulhall, director of research at the group, said Mr Tate ""poses a genuine threat to young men, radicalising them towards extremism misogyny, racism and homophobia"".
He added: ""We've provided significant evidence to the major social media platforms, including Meta, about his activity and why he must be removed.""
Videos about Mr Tate have proved popular across social media platforms, particularly on TikTok where videos using the #AndrewTate hashtag have been viewed more than 12.7 billion times.
But this number represents not just videos of Tate and his supporters - it also includes videos made by people criticising the influencer.
On YouTube, some of his most popular videos have had millions of views.
In one video, during which he was interviewed by another YouTuber, he said he was ""absolutely a misogynist"", adding: ""I'm a realist and when you're a realist you're sexist. There's no way you can be rooted in reality and not be sexist.""
Later in the same video he called women ""intrinsically lazy"" and said there was ""no such thing as an independent female"".
In a different video, Mr Tate said: ""If I have responsibility over her, then I must have a degree of authority.""
He added: ""You can't be responsible for a dog if it doesn't obey you."""	/news/technology-62602913
health	West Midlands GP calls for better support for veterans	"Doctor Robin Simpson said he did not want veterans to be disadvantaged by their service to the country
A former Army doctor has urged GP surgeries to sign up to a scheme to give military veterans better support and care.
Robin Simpson's own practice in Hampton in Arden, near Solihull, West Midlands, has become a ""veteran friendly"" surgery.
Royal College of GPs scheme gives them access to specialised guidance and training about what veterans may need.
""My vision is to improve the healthcare of veterans,"" he said.
m O'Sullivan served in Afghanistan as an Army reservist in 2007 and found last year's withdrawal of troops brought back painful memories. 
He said he was struggling to process them and turned to Mr Simpson's surgery for help.
""I came to speak to my GP who actually was incredibly understanding and got me some really good help very quickly,"" he said.
More than 1,300 practices in England have signed up to the scheme, according to the Royal College of GPs.
Former RAF pilot John Bransbury also uses the Hampton in Arden surgery and said it was a comfort knowing they understood his background.
""I think it's an excellent, excellent idea, really, to make GPs aware of the different circumstances under which service people actually work,"" he added.

health	Doctor warns about weight-loss operations abroad	"A senior doctor has warned people about the potential dangers of travelling abroad for weight-loss surgery.
Prof Alex Miras, a consultant at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry, said more people were opting for surgeries overseas because of a lack of services in Northern Ireland.
He said he was seeing more people who needed emergency aftercare on return.
""Because more and more people are going, as a result there are more complications,"" he said.
""The percentage of these complications remains very low. 
""Even if those cases are still few, they are very memorable because they can be serious"".
Derry businessman Joseph McVeigh, 35, flew to Turkey a year ago to have a gastric sleeve fitted.
Since surgery he has lost six and a half stone and is delighted with his new lifestyle.
""Before, I would have eaten everything and anything - hunger woke me up, it was as if you heard a big bang in the street.
""At times I would have woken in the night and ate and would not have remembered it.""
His diet was all about ""big dinners followed by chocolate and lemonade at night"".
urning point was when he was helping his father who asked him to go up to the attic.
""I genuinely couldn't do it. I was too fat. That really knocked my confidence,"" he said.
He said he was apprehensive about the surgery, but he had the support of family and friends.
A year on from the surgery, he said he felt fantastic.
""My energy levels are through the roof... I am just oozing with happiness.""
He said he had followed the post-surgery regime and changed his lifestyle.
""Now, I can eat anything but I just can't eat a lot. About 80% of that raging hunger is gone.
""I have no regrets, I would do it again tomorrow .""
Almost two-thirds of adults in Northern Ireland are classed as overweight or obese.
Bariatric surgery is not available on the NHS in Northern Ireland. 
""The important thing to say is that most people who go abroad and come back do not have a complication,"" said Prof Miras, who is also an academic at Ulster University. 
""But they need to be followed up for life, for mutational complications, for deficiencies for example different vitamins and minerals, and sometimes even psychological complications but unusual - they need to be followed up.""
He said the most common complication was the development of a leak following surgery, which required more surgery.
Bariatric surgery, also known as weight-loss surgery, is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese (having a body mass index of 40 or above or 35 plus other obesity-related health conditions).
Patients must have tried and failed to achieve clinically-beneficial weight loss by all other appropriate non-surgical methods and be fit for surgery.
wo most common types of weight loss surgery are:
Prof Miras said anyone considering travelling for weight-loss surgery needed to do their research.
""They need to understand the fact there are potential risks. It is important they travel to a place where they are certain they will receive good care,"" he said.
""They need to investigate and research it before they make the decision, to choose the country, the surgeon and the hospital where they are going to be operated on.
Prof Miras said he understood why people travelled for surgery.
""That there are no options available in Northern Ireland at present is a fault with the system,"" he said.
He added he would suggest that people stay at home and look into lifestyle changes, medication or surgery elsewhere in the UK or in the private sector.
re are no official statistics available on the number of people who have travelled abroad for bariatric surgery, including gastric bands and gastric sleeve operations.
Department of Health said it was looking at ways to collate data on the number of patients who needed emergency aftercare when they return to Northern Ireland in order to understand the scale of the problem.
""A weight management service remains a priority for future service development, but this is dependent on adequate resources being made available,"" a spokesperson said.
rtment is also considering how best to ensure the general population is aware of the associated challenges and risks, including the need to arrange appropriate follow-up care with private providers."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63700049
business	‘My bus ticket was more than I got paid an hour’	"ungest workers have seen the minimum wage rise by less than older colleagues - as the latest employment figures reveal average wages are not keeping up with the rising cost of living.
As a BBC Young Reporter, I wanted to look at this further because of my own experiences at work. 
I've had part-time jobs since I was 15, often earning the minimum wage. As a younger worker that meant I was paid less than older colleagues - even when I was doing the same work. 
It's something I've found really unfair, and I don't think younger people always feel like they can stand up for themselves at work. 
It's a issue some of my friends say they've also experienced. 
""It's frustrating,"" says 15-year-old Isabella, who left her job in a restaurant because she earned less than her colleagues - with the only difference being that she couldn't serve alcohol.
""It was a small place and we were all doing the same thing, but for different amounts,"" she says.
Isabella was being paid the minimum wage - which at the time was £4.62 an hour for people aged under 18. ""The bus ticket into town, for the day, was around £4.80 I think, so my bus ticket was more than I was earning per hour."" 
Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that minimum rates of pay have gone up less for those under 20 than for older workers since 2016.
In April, the minimum wage went up to £4.81 per hour for those under 18, a 24% increase on the rate in 2016, which was £3.87 per hour. 
But for 21 and 22-year-olds it rose by 37% over the same period, from £6.70 to £9.18 per hour. And it climbed by 42% to £9.50 per hour for 23 and 24-year-olds.
r cohort have since 2017 been paid what is known as the National Living Wage. Originally for over-25s, it has been extended to all workers over 23, and there are plans to lower the threshold further to 21 by 2024.
Later this month, the Low Pay Commission - an independent body that advises the government - will make its recommendations on what minimum wage rates should be for next year. The Commission says its remit is to push pay for younger workers as high as possible without damaging their employment prospects.  
Richard Davies, Professor of Public Understanding of Economics at Bristol University, tells me that's important because ""if you have a long period of being unemployed when you're young, that can affect you for the rest of your life"".
He also explains that the lower minimum wage for young people also ""rests on the idea that they will have fewer skills and lower productivity than older workers"", adding that there is also an assumption that young people are getting something back.
""The deal is that by going to work, you're also being trained. So the firm is giving you something - and that makes it fair that they pay you a little less.""
's certainly something Nick Collins believes his business, Loungers, offers. 
More than 6,000 people work for the bar and restaurant chain - and 40% are under 21. 
""We used to pay everyone the same,"" he says. ""But when the National Living Wage started to climb it became less affordable for us."" 
New starters joining his company are now paid less if they're under 18 or under 21, but he says they can ""progress quickly"" and once they're in more senior roles are paid the same regardless of age. 
""We agonised over it a lot, we didn't like doing it,"" he says, adding that all under-18s and under-21s earn at least £8 per hour - more than the minimum wage. 
But Mr Collins acknowledges that attracting and retaining staff in hospitality is getting harder - competing with sectors like retail where hours can be more sociable and pay can be higher.
""I'd love to pay everyone more, but we just wouldn't be able to sustain that,"" he tells me.
I now work in a supermarket where I earn more than £10 an hour. Everyone there is paid the same regardless of their age, including my school friend Tabitha, who works there too.
She left a job at a bowling alley where she was being paid the minimum wage.
""It was awful,"" she says. ""The pay didn't match up to the work we had to do - there was a lot of stress."" 
""The older people would be working on the bar, standing around chatting, and the younger people would be running around, really busy, trying to make sure the jobs were finished.""
As for asking for a pay rise, Tabitha says it ""simply doesn't happen when you're this young"", adding that ""no one takes you seriously"".
But that may be changing. 
As the latest figures show the unemployment rate at its lowest for nearly 50 years, Tony Wilson from the Institute for Employment Studies says young people are ""voting with their feet.""
""We've got the highest number of people changing jobs that we've ever seen,"" he says. ""That is prompting employers to try and treat people better around pay and around fairness at work.""
So is there an argument for paying everyone the same, regardless of age? Perhaps not everyone, says Tony Wilson.
""My worry would be that if employers had to pay 16 and 17-year-olds £9.50 an hour, they just wouldn't do it,"" he tells me. 
""But when you get up to ages 18, 19, or 20, I think it's harder to justify paying people £6 something an hour when their colleagues are getting £9 something an hour.""
A spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said:  ""While we know the priority for younger workers in those first years is to secure work and gain experience, we are nevertheless determined to ensure it pays properly.""

entertainment	I'm A Celebrity: Matt Hancock told breaking Covid rules was 'slap in face'	"Matt Hancock has said there was ""no excuse"" for the actions that led to his resignation as health secretary.
f I'm A Celebrity also saw one campmate tell the MP his behaviour was ""a slap in the face"".
He resigned after he was caught on CCTV kissing a colleague while social distancing guidelines were in place.
Hancock, who was accused of failing to follow the rules he helped put in place, said: ""Look, I know how people felt. That's why I resigned, right?""
Hancock quit his cabinet position in June 2021 after the Sun obtained footage of him having an affair in his ministerial office with aide Gina Coladangelo, for whom he later left his wife.
On Thursday's episode, TV presenter Scarlette Douglas asked Hancock about the encounter, which breached coronavirus social distancing rules.
""It was hard. A lot of people had difficult times,"" she said. ""And then to see that people that had kind of set the rules had then broken them, I think was a big slap in the face for everyone.""
West Suffolk MP has faced criticism from his constituents and MPs from across the political spectrum after heading to the Australian jungle for ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! 
Hancock was suspended as a Tory MP after his involvement was announced. He has said he hopes to raise awareness for his dyslexia campaign while taking part in the series. 
Douglas warned Hancock it may take time for some campmates to come to terms with his arrival in camp.
She told him: ""There's a lot of things that happened with you during the times, which does make it difficult because people are angry and upset - emotions are running high.""
""We are not going to ever exclude anyone,"" she continued. ""We want to make sure that everyone's a family, but if it does feel tough for the first few days, I'm sure you understand why.""
Hancock replied: ""That's very good of you to say that.""
Later in the Bush Telegraph, Hancock told viewers: ""Scarlette was very open and also very thoughtful and that's really what it's all about.
""Being able to talk about things, whether they're things you're proud of, or things you're not proud of.""
During a separate conversation with comedian Babatúndé Aléshé, Hancock discussed how his life had changed after his affair became public.
""It was really tough,"" he said. ""I messed up and I fessed up. I resigned and it's no excuse but I fell in love, right? That also had a lot of other consequences obviously.""
Asked whether he was still with Ms Coladangelo, he replied: ""With Gina? Yeah very much so, yeah, totally. That'll be the best thing about being kicked out [of the series], seeing her on the bridge.""
Hancock has frequently apologised for his behaviour since stepping down as health secretary. Last year, he told the BBC he was ""sorry to those I have let down"".
Matt Hancock told the BBC last year he was sorry he let people down after breaking social distancing guidance
w Hancock take part in the latest Bushtucker trial, Tentacles of Terror, in which he was trapped inside a octopus-shaped cage full of underwater critters.
former health secretary was seen collecting 11 stars in Thursday's episode, the maximum number possible, winning meals for everyone in camp that night.
As he was lowered into the water to begin his trial, host Ant McPartlin asked him: ""You must have met a few snakes in your time in Westminster."" Hancock replied: ""I see what you did there.""
As Hancock made his way back to the camp after completing the trial, comedian Seann Walsh and soap star Sue Cleaver were seen discussing his decision to enter the jungle.
Asked what he thought when he met Hancock, Walsh said: ""I'm just going to say it how I saw it, he was really lovely, and that man will have a very different account of what he did to what we all think happened and there will be reasons.
""I'm not justifying anything that that guy did or certainly what that government, you know, the decisions they've made, but being in his job while that [the pandemic] was going on...""
Cleaver replied: ""I totally, totally agree with you, but the choice after everything that happened, and the impact on everybody at home and families and people in homes, to make a choice to come into I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! does not sit well with me.""
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC on Thursday that Hancock should ""voluntarily leave"" the I'm A Celebrity jungle and return to Parliament.
ursday's episode concluded with Ant and Dec revealing to campmates that Hancock and singer Boy George had been jointly voted to take part in the next Bushtucker trial."	/news/entertainment-arts-63591640
health	South West Acute Hospital: Surgeon hits out at 'parish pump politics'	"Surgeons have ""voted with their feet"" to temporarily withdraw emergency general surgery from an Enniskillen hospital, a surgeon has said.
Western Trust said it made the call for public safety reasons as it had problems recruiting surgical staff to South West Acute Hospital (SWAH).
Barry McAree accused some politicians of engaging in ""parish pump politics"". 
Sinn Féin's Colm Gildernew said this was a ""disgraceful"" way to refer to ""genuine concerns"" about the decision.
former chairman of Stormont's health committee said it was an ""extremely disappointing failure by the trust to recruit surgeons"" where a need had been identified. 
""This is not and nor should it be represented as any kind of transformation,"" Mr Gildernew told BBC's Good Morning programme. 
He said it was an ""unplanned collapse"".
Mr Gildernew added that assurances had been given that this was a temporary situation. 
However consultant colorectal and general surgeon, Barry McAree, said he hoped the decision would not be temporary.
""I believe that this should have happened a long time ago, as do many others,"" he said.
He added that had the Bengoa review been ""properly implemented"", it would have happened in a more controlled fashion.
Bengoa was a major report into the health service in Northern Ireland in 2016.
""The fact is that surgeons and patients are better looked after in bigger units with longer travel times even taken into the mix,"" Mr McAree said.
""The word emergency has been overplayed by many with regards to emergency general surgery,"" he said. 
""Unfortunately, realistically, us general surgeons just aren't that important and the majority of what we deal with is classified as urgent.
""Even hours travelled to bigger units gives better results than continuing with small poorly resourced units.""
He said surgeons wanted to work in bigger, better staffed and better equipped units.
Dr Brendan Lavery, director of the Western Trust, said the decision was not going to lead to ""adverse outcomes"", and denied that this was a permanent measure.
He said he accepted that many people would be disappointed.
""This has happened because we were unable to recruit general surgeons.
""We have tried everything we can. In an ideal world, I would prefer to leave things as they are.""
He said the trust was currently trying to recruit surgeons. 
Despite saying the move was temporary, the trust did not say when it expected emergency general surgery would resume.
mergency department and other services will continue to operate as normal. 
Other - mostly lower grade - surgeons will remain on site at the County Fermanagh hospital.
will stabilise patients before they are transferred by ambulance to the likes of Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Londonderry, Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh or Sligo University Hospital across the border in the Republic of Ireland.
Local groups have said they are concerned that the road infrastructure does not support a quick transfer of patients from Enniskillen to Altnagelvin, Craigavon or hospitals in Belfast.  
In a further move, it has been confirmed the hospital is to become Northern Ireland's third elective surgical hub.
In October, emergency general surgery was ""temporarily"" moved from Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry to Craigavon Area Hospital. 
Emergency general surgery relates to the treatment of patients with conditions such as acute abdominal pain, infections, bleeding and trauma.
It includes operations such as removing a patient's gall bladder, appendix or part of the bowel.  
Western Trust said existing services including its emergency department and obstetrics remained unchanged.
It added there would be ""minimal to no impact"" on the other existing services at SWAH.

business	Royal Mail workers to vote on strike over pay	"More than 115,000 Royal Mail workers will begin voting on Tuesday over whether to go on strike over pay.
Ballot papers will be dispatched to the Communication Workers Union (CWU) members, with the result on 19 July.
If workers back action, the CWU says it could amount to the biggest ever strike by its members. Royal Mail says there are ""no grounds"" for strike action.
CWU is the latest of several unions to ballot for strikes in recent weeks as the cost of living soars.
Prices are rising at their fastest pace for 40 years, with UK inflation at 9.1%, the highest rate since March 1982.
Higher costs for fuel, energy and good are biting into household budgets and workers and unions are pushing for pay rises to cope with them.
But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"", where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers through higher prices.
Britain's railways were disrupted when thousands of RMT Union members walked out last week and hundreds of British Airways workers at Heathrow Airport have also voted to go on strike over their wages.
Separately, 114 Post Offices are to be closed on 11 July when workers strike over pay.
CWU deputy general secretary Terry Pullinger said in a video posted on Twitter that the union wanted an ""inflation-based, no-strings pay award"" for its Royal Mail members.
""The company has imposed a 2% pay award, miles away from where inflation is, totally inadequate,"" he said.
CWU said the pay award was ""despite previous agreements that no immediate executive action would be taken over pay"".
""Throughout this entire dispute, Royal Mail management have conducted themselves insultingly and disrespectfully to key workers,"" Mr Pullinger said.
""Their conduct, and particularly the imposition of such an aggressive pay offer, has eroded trust among loyal employees.""
But Royal Mail said it believed there were ""no grounds for industrial action"".
""We offered a deal worth up to 5.5% for CWU grade colleagues, the biggest increase we have offered for many years, which was rejected by the CWU,"" a spokesman said.
mpany said further talks were scheduled with the union this week and it hoped an agreement could be reached.
Confirmed strikes
Ballots on possible strike action
Chinelo Awa, founder of Good Cake Day, relies mostly on Royal Mail to deliver her brownies and cookies to customers.
She told the BBC's Wake Up to Money programme that any strike action would affect her business as she would most likely have to use a more expensive courier.
Ms Awa said: ""I want everyone to receive a fair pay, so from a personal view I sympathise, but as a business owner there is a need to take a sit back and go OK, what is this going to do? Is this a busy period? Is this going to impact us?
""Sometimes we can be really busy and we are sending out upwards of a 100 brownies orders in a week. If that is happening and we are relying on Royal Mail for that then we go for courier companies but that typically means higher costs.""
Ms Awa, whose shop is based in Battersea, London, said where Royal Mail would charge £5.05 for next day recorded delivery, a courier would charge ""upwards of £6.58 to about £8"".
""In isolation that doesn't sound like a lot of money but then when you multiply it by a 100 it starts to add up,"" she said."	/news/business-61957003

Air Balloon on the A417 at Birdlip, Gloucestershire, is being demolished to make way for a major road upgrade.
It has been called the Air Balloon for at least 220 years, and gave its name to a roundabout joining major local roads, which has become an accident blackspot.

""As you will understand, this is a difficult time, but we're looking forward to giving everyone a last great Christmas with us to remember."" 
Customers and passing drivers were quick to respond to The Air Balloon's announcement.
Carol Challis, the widow of late actor John Challis, tweeted: ""Goodbye to the Air Balloon or the Air 'alloon as John used to call it after the B fell off one year. Finally there is to be a new road but the pub has to be demolished to make way. On our way to London we passed it hundreds of times.""
Glyn Evans commented on Facebook: ""You've been a perfect meeting point for my family, and we have made some great memories under your roof and in your garden.""
Angela Bicknell added: My family over at least four generations have been visitors to The Air Balloon over the years.
""It will be sorely missed by all in Gloucestershire.""
ub was named The Air Balloon because Birdlip and Crickley Hill were popular launch sites when ballooning was first popularised in England in the 1780s.
It was first The Balloon, and this later became The Air Balloon.

Donald is on the small side for a defensive tackle but uses his physical ability to get past opponents and get after the quarterback. He now has 102 career sacks, with 14 overall this season.
""A lot of people have speed, strength, explosiveness or flexibility, but he has it all,"" said Crawford.
""He's as strong as anybody in the NFL, his hands are very accurate and he plays with leverage - to get under offensive lineman's pads [and get past them].
""Being a defensive lineman, I understand how hard it is to do what he does consistently, when teams are trying to take him out of the game - yet he's still the league's most disruptive defensive lineman.
""In the defensive-line room, when the coach put on Aaron Donald's tape, we used to say 'what's the point of watching this? He's just a different type of human.'""
In November the Rams traded two picks in this year's draft to sign Miller from the Denver Broncos.
raft pick in 2011, he was named the game's Most Valuable Player as he helped Denver win Super Bowl 50. He already has five sacks from eight games with LA.
""He's similar to Aaron Donald in that he's the complete package,"" said Crawford.
""In the defensive-line room we talk about 'bending the corner' - when a defensive end is rushing the quarterback and forcing the offensive tackle back, how low can the linebacker stay while running at an angle towards the quarterback?
""That makes it harder for the offensive lineman to get his hands on you, and that's something Von Miller does better than anybody. He has the balance to stay low to the ground, bending his body while running full speed.""
Rams gave up two first-round picks to sign Ramsey from the Jacksonville Jaguars early in the 2019 season.
He's remained a Pro Bowler each year and in the regular season he tied his career-high for tackles and interceptions.
""Some defensive backs you'll never see in the weights room, some aren't even among the fastest players on the team,"" said Crawford.
""But their instincts are on another level, and Jalen Ramsey's ability to cover receivers is natural.
""The best DBs secure tackles and make sure they bring the receiver down, and he's a good tackler. He's physical but has finesse at the same time.""
In March 2021, the Rams decided to move on from Jared Goff and traded him and three early draft picks to the Detroit Lions for Stafford.
After being 2009's first draft pick, Stafford had used his big arm to quietly rack up 45,000 passing yards while seldom threatening the play-offs.
Now surrounded by elite talent, he tied for a career-high 41 touchdown passes before claiming his first play-off win - after 186 NFL games - and leading a game-winning drive at Tampa Bay.
""He's a pocket passer and a momentum quarterback,"" said Crawford. ""Once he gets into a rhythm he can gas the defence, and he has a lot of weapons in this offence.
""He's proven he can take control of a game and get wins. I can't overstate how hard it is to get a quarterback who's consistent, knowledgeable, and can relate to every player on the offence.""
Kupp was unheralded when selected with 2017's 69th draft pick but Stafford's arrival has resulted in a breakout season.
Kupp was named the Offensive Player of the Year after earning the triple crown of most receptions (145), most receiving yards (1,947) and most receiving touchdowns (16).
""Sometimes you get an unassuming receiver who isn't in the spotlight at the beginning but over time their stats speak for themselves,"" said Crawford.
""He reminds me of Cole Beasley or Julian Edelman, a consistent receiver with sure hands, and they bring another level of confidence to the quarterback.
""You get these dynamic duos and once they warm up, it opens up opportunities for everybody else on the offence, including the running game.""
Unlike Kupp, 'OBJ' has been a star since the New York Giants drafted him in 2014, with a one-handed touchdown catch in his rookie season going viral.
Since then, his career has been disrupted by injury, with a move to the Cleveland Browns not working out before the Rams signed him as a free agent in November.
He now has six touchdowns from 11 games for LA, including his first in the play-offs, and had his most receiving yards for more than two years in their NFC Championship win.
""I was in for that play [the one-handed catch], for Dallas at the Giants, and thought it was a [penalty] flag against him and a drop,"" said Crawford.
""I was like 'there's no way that's a catch', but then the crowd started going crazy. It was an unbelievable play and he practices those catches regularly.
""But he has great speed too. You can have a team backed up on third down then 'bang', it's a 60-yard touchdown because he can just outrun everyone."""	/sport/american-football/60335554
entertainment	I'm A Celebrity: Matt Hancock seen in first Bushtucker Trial	"Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock has taken part in his first Bushtucker Trial for the show I'm A Celebrity. 
Hancock, whose appearance in the programme while a serving MP has been condemned, took part in the challenge with comedian Seann Walsh.
Ahead of the trial being aired on ITV on Wednesday a letter was sent to some of his constituents in West Suffolk.
In it he says there are few places ""politicians can speak candidly to the nation.""
uncement that he was taking part in the reality show has already led to him being suspended as a Conservative MP but he will continue as an independent.
In the trial insects and slime are poured over him as he crawls through a tunnel and he and Walsh search for stars to win meals for their campmates.
Hancock seems to struggle telling hosts Ant and Dec: ""I can't find any stars""  but is not heard saying the catchphrase ""I'm a celebrity, get me out of here!"" which would allow him to abandon the challenge. 
Walsh is heard shrieking as more insects land on him from above. 
r are taking part in their first trial without any public vote as an initiation challenge on entering the camp in Australia.
After being widely criticised for his participation in the show, Hancock said he would donate some of his fee to charity and that he hoped to use his time in the jungle to raise awareness for his campaign to support people with dyslexia.
In a letter being sent to some of his constituents, Hancock said: ""There are many ways to do the job of being an MP… Whether I'm in camp for one day or three weeks, there are very few places people will be able to see a politician as they really are and where politicians can speak candidly to the nation.""
He added that he ""fully understood"" constituents' concerns and how there were those who did not think he should be on the show. 
re was further criticism of Hancock during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. 
As MP Neil Coyle was being heckled from the Conservative benches, he suggested Tory MPs could ""go eat kangaroo testicles"" in a reference to Hancock's involvement in the show. 
Hancock, who resigned as health secretary last year after breaching Covid social distancing guidance by kissing a colleague, has entered the jungle after spending a period of time in isolation.
ries of I'm A Celebrity launched on Sunday, with Coronation Street's Sue Cleaver, singer Boy George and footballer Jill Scott among the contestants. 
A spokesman for Hancock said: ""Matt will be making a donation to St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk, and causes supporting dyslexia - including the British Dyslexia Association, off the back of his appearance. 
""He will, of course, declare the amount he receives from the show to Parliament to ensure complete transparency, as normal."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63576972
technology	Kate Bush: The Lambeg that gave Running Up That Hill its thunder	"Singer Kate Bush ordered a Lambeg drum from a shop in Belfast
One of Northern Ireland's most mysterious musical stories has been given new life by the resurgence of one of the most famous pop songs of the 80s.
On one side - Kate Bush, the enigmatic singer-songwriter, and Running Up That Hill, which has hit number one in the UK charts a full 37 years after its original release. 
Back then, the song went to number three in the charts but thanks to prominent usage in Netflix's horror smash Stranger Things, it will become Bush's second number one of her career, a mere 44 years after Wuthering Heights.
On the other side, the Lambeg drum - Northern Ireland's most iconic musical instrument, a seriously loud and huge piece of kit with a booming sound made famous by street parades.
Unlikely musical bedfellows perhaps - but no better way to ring out Running Up That Hill's ""thunder in our hearts"" than with the thunderous timbre of the Lambeg.
Kate Bush, one of the biggest pop stars in the world at the time, seemed to think so. 
Which is why William Hewitt, a drum maker on Sandy Row in Belfast, found himself with a strange request back in the early 1980s - and why the singer ended up with a bespoke drum, adorned with white fluffy clouds and apparently dubbed The Cloudbuster.
Elizabeth McKinley, William's daughter, told BBC News NI all about how her father - who ""wasn't really an excitable man at the best of times"" - came home to tell her the star had come into his Drum Sounds shop.
""She'd come into the shop with two young boys and apparently they were members of the band and someone had put her in the direction of my father as the drum maker - and he said 'you'll never guess who she was?', and he told us it was Kate Bush. He was very happy about it.
""He knew of her music, that would've been all - never would've dreamt he would've met her.""
ry of Kate Bush and the Lambeg has taken on mythical status in Northern Ireland music circles.
Bush, famously reclusive, hasn't released any new music in 11 years, almost never gives interviews and rarely plays gigs - her first run of concerts since 1979 came eight years ago.
Her music has occasionally returned to prominence in the years since her heyday in the 80s and early 90s - for instance, when The Futureheads yodelled-up cover of Hounds of Love turned into an indie hit in 2004.
But for the most part, Bush and her music remains an enigma - and likewise, so does The Cloudbuster. She has never spoken about it and its status is unknown. Meanwhile, William Hewitt, its maker, has since died. 
However, Northern Ireland music journalist Stuart Bailie and former musician Mike Edgar took up the story in an online video posted in 2020.
In it, Edgar - a member of Cruella De Ville, a Belfast-based band signed to record label giants EMI in the 1980s - recalled how his A&R man John Bagnall, who also represented Kate Bush, asked him if he could source a Lambeg for her. She had seen one on TV and wanted to know if she could get her own.
Perhaps it shouldn't have been that surprising that Kate Bush would look to this side of the Irish Sea for musical inspiration.
Her mother, Hannah Daly, was from Waterford in the Republic of Ireland and an Irish dancer. The album Hounds of Love would go to feature a track called Jig of Life, which included an extended coda of traditional Irish music. 
Renowned traditional Irish musicians Dónal Lunny, John Sheahan and Liam O'Flynn played on the record. 
Despite famously composing much of Hounds of Love on a synthesizer - the Fairlight CMI - she melded those electronic sounds with acoustic folk instruments, such as balalaikas, bouzoukis and didgeridoos. And, of course, the Lambeg. 
According to Edgar, it was he who put the initial calls in to William Hewitt to arrange the drum to be made. He also recalled how it came to be painted with clouds.
Lambegs are traditionally associated with parades across Northern Ireland, with drummers beating out marching tunes. Usually they are painted with images associated with the Orange Order. But Kate Bush's request was a little out of the ordinary.  
""She had a particular picture she wanted on it,"" said Elizabeth McKinley. ""And father was used to doing the like of King Billy (King William of Orange) or orange lillies. But he had done banners so was quite a good painter, he was able to do the clouds and the picture from what she described she wanted.""
Elizabeth said it was Bush herself who came to get the drum and that she later wrote to thank her father.
""It's just a lovely thank you letter and it was handwritten and signed 'Kate Bush' - I have it somewhere. Somewhere among memorabilia…""
She also said Bush sent her father a video clip of the drum being used when recording the album.
rum, said Elizabeth, would have cost £300 or £350 in those days but now, even without being used by a beloved pop star, a brand new Lambeg would fetch about £4,000.
made drums - about 40 or 50 that William Hewitt would have made during his career - are still around, said Elizabeth. ""They're all out there somewhere, a lot of Lambeg men in the country have bought them and collected them over the years.""
She added: ""I was very proud of him. Proud of the banners every Twelfth, to stand and watch those banners come down - and certain drums would have my father's stamp on them and I would've known there's my father's (drum) heads. My father put the heads on that drum.""
rums are William Hewitt's legacy. And, now, so is the UK's number one single, finally at the top of the charts almost four decades after he tightened the drumheads on what would come to be known as The Cloudbuster.
Now, when Elizabeth hears the song and tells this story she thinks of him. She added: ""I think about him all the time."" "	/news/uk-northern-ireland-61844728
technology	Drones to track Walsall's off-road bikers	"A council is considering buying drones to deal with nuisance off-road bikers following hundreds of complaints.
In the past 12 months West Midlands Police has received 777 reports from residents in Walsall.
Walsall Council says the technology could help police gather evidence to track offenders and seize their motorbikes.
""These are deadly machines in the wrong hands,"" said Paul Gordon, the council's director of resilient communities.
Mr Gordon added the problem with off-road bikes spanned the borough but there were ""corridors of activity where we would want to take targeted action"", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
""We're gathering lots of data and we're starting to get the evidence together to be able to deal with this in a proactive way. The message from ourselves is 'we're coming to get you and your bikes',"" he said.
Ch Supt Phil Dolby, of Walsall police, said the West Midlands force did have use of drone technology but this was shared across the area, with demand high.
""Off-road bikes and the way they are being ridden at the moment is totally unacceptable, frustrating and very dangerous,""said Ch Supt Dolby. ""What's quite tricky for us is a tactical response that doesn't lead to injuries to the public, these people or my officers either being injured or in court.""
Police were ""coming around to"" the use of drone footage to track offenders, confiscate and crush vehicles, he added.
Walsall Council figures reveal a further 57 complaints of anti-social biking to its community protection team in the past 12 months.
Councillor Garry Perry, deputy leader for resilient communities, said he had also received more than 100 reports, largely of noise nuisance and intimidation, from residents in the Pelsall area.
""You have those who just have [bikes] for recreational use but you have another type who use those vehicles on the road without helmets and often with their faces covered,"" he said.
Walsall Council leader Mike Bird said his cabinet would look into financing a drone for the police to use solely in the borough.
""We've got to stop this. It is an invest to save,"" Mr Bird added.
