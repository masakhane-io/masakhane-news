entertainment	Pavement on their reunion: 'We're like an uncaged tiger'	"Depending on who you ask, Pavement are either the greatest indie band of the nineties, or a minor blip on the rock landscape.
Formed in California in 1989, they were the ultimate underground band, whose noisy, shambolic songs were laced with enough melodic charm to lodge permanently in your brain. 
r first two albums, Slanted and Enchanted (1992) and Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain (1994) were hailed as masterpieces of lo-fi, slacker rock - a description that's technically true, but which fails to capture their magic.
From the fuzzy squall of Summer Babe to the celestial balladry of Spit On A Stranger and the goofiness of Cut Your Hair, Pavement knew their way around a pop song, no matter how awkward the delivery. 
uilt an audience who gorged on frontman Stephen Malkmus's wayward song structures and cryptic lyrics (""Lies and betrayals / Fruit-covered nails,"" he sang, mystifyingly, on Trigger Cut).
But after Crooked Rain pushed Pavement towards the limelight, an unpredictable follow-up - 1995's Wowee Zowee - put them back in the shadows. 
It was an act of commercial self-sabotage that only deepened their cult appeal. Pavement never committed the ""sin"" of having a hit song and they quit while they were ahead: Disbanding in 1999, with just five almost-perfect albums to their name.
r last show, in London's Brixton Academy, hinted at internal tensions. Attaching handcuffs to his microphone, Malkmus told the audience: ""These symbolise what it's like being in a band all these years."" When the gig ended, the band left on one side of the stage, and Malkmus walked off in the opposite direction. 
But percussionist Bob Nastanovich says the myth surrounding Pavement's demise is more dramatic than the reality.
""It's never been anywhere near as bad as people thought it was,"" he says. ""There really wasn't that much drama at all. It was more about exhaustion and desire to do other things.""
For Nastanovich, that meant a career in horse racing - but today he's speaking on Zoom from San Francisco, where Pavement are in the middle of a reunion tour (their second, after a previous fling in 2010). 
We're quickly joined on the call by Malkmus, mid-order at a local coffee joint. Americano in hand, he chats enthusiastically about their upcoming London shows and the band's giant video screen, which he's nicknamed R2-FU.
""The tour's been great so far,"" he beams. ""I'm sort of like a tiger let out of the cage. An older, greyer tiger.""
His sunny disposition might seem out of character to longtime fans. In Pavement's prime, Malkmus was often accused of being surly and aloof. According to drummer Steve West, there were times he refused to speak to his bandmates, pulling a jacket over his head and referring to himself as ""the little bitch"".
But he rejected those characterisations, telling one reporter it was all ""part of the act"". 
""I'm nice at the bottom of my heart, but I like the 'tough love, bitchy performer' thing.""
, he seems mellow. He talks in ellipses and apologises several times for rambling - but there's an obvious affection for Pavement and its fans.
fanbase has only expanded in recent years.
As the dust of the 90s settled, Pavement's stock rose, with acts like Blur, Animal Collective, Deerhunter and Beabadoobee citing them as a major influence. Rolling Stone recently ranked Slanted and Enchanted at number 199 in its top 500 albums of all time. Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain landed at 343 and Wowee Zowee (which has undergone a critical reappraisal) was at 265.
""It's a great compliment,"" says Nastanovich. ""But I mean, they had to put something from early 90s on there, other than Nevermind.""
Over the years, the band's archives have been raided for a series of album reissues that further enhanced their reputation, but Malkmus claims not to have heard them. Instead, he prepared for the Pavement reunion on YouTube.
""I listened to every song, just about, that we ever did, starting from the very beginning to make sure I had enough material to surprise people and make it magical and every show different.""
He has kept his word. 
ur is designed as a series of mini-residencies, and every night delivers ""a different set and a different vibe"", raved Rolling Stone critic Rob Sheffield. ""Twenty-five songs in two hours, rampaging all over their catalogue, rocking the house each night with a couple dozen of the greatest tunes ever written for electrically amplified string instruments.""
roblem? That big video screen ruins their spontaneity.
""We're used to passing out setlists 20 minutes before we go on stage,"" says Nastanovich, ""but to get everything set up for the show to work, it needs to be in five hours beforehand.""
Even so, the band have frequently thrown their plans out the window. 
""Last night we had a couple of band meetings on stage and changed a couple of songs,"" he confesses. ""I'm sure it's thoroughly entertaining for the audience to watch, you know? A cluster of people deciding what to play next.""
But the tour also sees a level of professionalism Pavement lacked first time round.
""We had a proper rehearsal this time,"" says Malkmus, only half-joking. ""In the 90s, tours were hammered down our throats at all times and we'd just jump on them. 
""This time, we worked on our chops, which is a funny thing to say with Pavement. The drummer in particular spent a year practicing. We never had a chance to do that before.
""But it's still loose, it's still Pavement,"" he reassures. ""The emotions coming at you are gonna take you back to when you first heard us.""
One track, however, is a new addition to the set.
Harness Your Hopes, a b-side recorded during sessions for 1997's Brighten The Corners, has suddenly risen from obscurity to become Pavement's most-streamed song,
Malkmus only became aware when he heard the song in a bakery near his home in Portland, Oregon. At first, he thought it was the Rolling Stones' Tumblin' Dice. Then the vocals kicked in and ""my kids said they knew the song"".
It turned out the 25-year-old track had inspired a TikTok dance craze.
""I assumed it was a kind of smaller viral hit,"" he says, ""but it turns out we're like a strong Omicron.""
He laughs when I mention the second verse: ""Show me a word that rhymes with pavement/And I won't kill your parents and roast them on a spit"" (the joke being that the second line describes the word ""depravement"")
""That's the kind of thing you write when you're feeling cocky and you think it's a b-side,"" says Malkmus. 
""It's sort of bizarre, how history rewrites itself.""
g has brought Pavement a new audience, although Malkmus grumbles that they never make it to the moshpit.
""I hate to say it, but there's, like, a halo of wealth at the front, where the tickets cost more. And it's fine, but it's almost always older people with disposable income.""
Ultimately, though, Pavement are happy on the nostalgia circuit. 
""I like going to reunion shows,"" says Malkmus, ""because, almost always, the dudes and women are psyched to be up there. 
""I mean, I hear stories about mega-bands like The Police who exist in separate rooms and are mailing it in for the cash. This is not that.
""The feeling in the band is pretty much the exact same as it was the first time we ever got into a minivan in the 90s.""
g he won't consider, however, is adding to Pavement's body of work.
""That'd be really weird,"" he says. ""These songs are solid. They're old but they're still alive. I don't know why you would do it.""

entertainment	Somerset woman dedicates her first book to children she fostered	"A foster carer has dedicated her first book to all the children who came to her ""without warm jumpers"". 
Emma Lloyd, 52, who has fostered for more than eight years, said reading to the children would help them settle at night and ""forget unhappy memories"".
uthor, from Wellington, wrote the book after her own son thought the stories she made up should be shared. 
Little Red Dragon is about a dragon who encounters friendship and kindness as he looks for his missing jumper.  
Ms Lloyd said she was inspired to start fostering by friends and has since taken in babies, siblings and teenagers. 
""They can arrive late at night, maybe without pyjamas or shoes for the next day, and often without warm coats or jumpers,"" Ms Lloyd said.
""It's a scary time for these children and sometimes they display that through their behaviour. But it is an incredibly rewarding role.
""Seeing them a few months later, twirling around in their new party dress or proudly heading off to school - these are all little pictures I keep in my mind of children building their self-esteem and confidence,"" she said. 
Ms Lloyd was telling The Little Red Dragon to her eight-year-old daughter when her son, 17, walked in and told her she should ""write it down so other children could hear it"".
""For traumatised children especially, reading can allow them to lose themselves in another world and forget unhappy memories, or feelings of sadness or anger, just for a moment,"" she explained.
Ms Lloyd said rather than reading a book, she would dim the lights and tell her own story, which would comfort children, while not being stimulated by pictures, and help them get to sleep. 
On having the book published, Ms Lloyd said one of the ""nicest moments"" was when she received a video of a child she had fostered, with her new adoptive parents reading the book.
""That was lovely to see, because it was children like her that inspired me to publish it,"" she said.
Somerset County Council lead member for children and families, Tessa Munt, said the county urgently needed more foster homes and it was ""wonderful"" to see Ms Lloyd raising awareness of the importance of fostering.

technology	Mercedes-Benz to introduce acceleration subscription fee	"Mercedes-Benz is to offer an online subscription service in the US to make its electric cars speed up quicker.
For an annual cost of $1,200 (£991) excluding tax, the company will enable some of its vehicles to accelerate from 0-60mph a second faster.
It comes after rival manufacturer BMW offered a subscription feature earlier this year - for heated seats.
Mercedes has confirmed to BBC News it currently does not plan to introduce ""Acceleration Increase"" in the UK.
It will be available for purchase in the US on the Mercedes-EQ EQE 350 and EQS 450 vehicles, as well as their SUV counterparts.
According to the Mercedes US online store, the feature ""electronically increases"" the output of the car's motor, as well as the torque.
All told, it estimates this amounts to a 20-24% increase in output, allowing a Mercedes-EQ 350 SUV to accelerate from 0-60mph in about 5.2 seconds, as opposed to 6.2 seconds without the subscription.
Jack McKeown, Association of Scottish Motoring Writers president and motoring editor of the Courier newspaper, in Dundee, said Mercedes's new feature was ""unsurprising but dispiriting"". 
""When you pay a monthly subscription for a phone or for broadband, you're paying for the company to supply and maintain a data network,"" he said.
""Mercedes is asking you to pay for hardware it has already installed in the car - and which it presumably already made a profit margin on when you bought the car.  
""Trying to leverage even more profit out of subscription services is a worrying trend and I hope there is a consumer backlash against it."" 
In July, BMW faced a backlash when it announced customers could pay £25 per month to unlock heated seats and steering wheels in their cars.
And in December 2021, Toyota announced it would charge some drivers $8 per month to remotely start their cars using a key fob.
In 2019, Tesla introduced ""Acceleration Boost"", which makes its Model 3 vehicles accelerate from 0-60mph half a second faster for a one-time fee of $2,000.
Acceleration Increase subscription is listed as ""coming soon"" on the US Mercedes storefront, with no exact date given for its release."	/news/technology-63743597
politics	What's happening in Parliament next week?	"It's going to be a pretty weird week in Parliament. There's some significant law-making - on stamp duty and EU Law - but it will be completely overshadowed by the battle for the Conservative leadership. 
w PM could be anointed as early as Monday afternoon, or as late as Friday, if an online ballot of Tory members is required.
Question times and select committee interrogations will feature ministers who may not be in office a week later, or who may be auditioning for a promotion.
w prime minister will have allies to reward, opponents to de-fang, enemies to punish and big beasts to bring in, so expect significant ministerial changes.
And how much point is there in asking about policy? 
re's a big financial statement due on 31 October - the Monday after the new PM is due to emerge.
But will the new PM want the proposals now being drawn up, or even the chancellor doing the drawing-up? Or will the threat of a market backlash ensure that the new PM accepts whatever decisions Jeremy Hunt has made? 
Meanwhile, Mr Hunt's arrival in the Treasury has created a vacancy for chair of the Health and Social Care Committee.

business	Eight million Australians urged to turn off lights	"Australia's energy minister has urged households in New South Wales - a state that includes the country's biggest city Sydney - to switch off their lights in the face of an energy crisis.
Chris Bowen says people should not use electricity for two hours every evening if they ""have a choice"".
However, he added he was ""confident"" that blackouts could be avoided.
It comes after Australia's main wholesale electricity market was suspended because of a surge in prices.
Mr Bowen asked people living in New South Wales to conserve as much power as possible.
""If you have a choice about when to run certain items, don't run them from 6 to 8 [in the evening],"" he said during a televised media conference in Canberra.
Australia is one of the world's biggest exporters of coal and liquefied natural gas but has been struggling with a power crisis since last month. Three quarters of the country's electricity is still generated using coal. It has long been accused of not doing enough to cut its emissions by investing in renewables. 
In recent weeks, Australia has felt the impact of disruptions to coal supplies, outages at several coal-fired power plants and soaring global energy prices. 
Flooding earlier this year hit some coal mines in New South Wales and Queensland, while technical issues have cut production at two mines that supply the market's biggest coal-fired station in New South Wales.
Around a quarter of Australia's coal-fired electricity generating capacity is currently out of service due to unexpected outages and scheduled maintenance.
Some electricity producers have seen their costs soar as global coal and gas prices have jumped due to sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, demand for energy has jumped amid a cold snap and as Australia's economy opens up after Covid-19 restrictions were eased.
All of this has helped drive up power prices on the wholesale market to above the A$300 (£173; $210) per megawatt hour price cap set by the market's regulator, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo).
However, that cap was below the cost of production for several generators, who decided to withhold capacity.
On Wednesday, Aemo took the unprecedented step of suspending the market and said it would set prices directly and compensate generators for the shortfall.
It also asked consumers in New South Wales to ""temporarily reduce their energy usage"".
Aemo has not given a timeline on when the suspension would be lifted. It said in a statement, ""The price cap will remain until cumulative wholesale electricity prices fall below the cumulative price threshold.""
""Aemo, as the national power system operator, will continue to monitor the situation and provide further updates should conditions change,"" it added.
On Thursday, Australia's biggest electricity producer AGL Energy said it expected to be able to supply more power to businesses and consumers in the coming days.
It has three units that have been out of service at its coal-fired plant in Bayswater, New South Wales.
re among several planned and unplanned outages that have helped cause the power crisis.
AGL said that one of the units should return to service on Thursday, while another will come back online by Saturday.
Meanwhile, Australia's new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the crisis would be raised at a meeting with state premiers which starts on Thursday.
Lynne Chester, an energy expert from the University of Sydney, told the BBC that policymakers have been aware of the risks of ageing generators for decades.
""The sector's regulators and policy makers have ignored the escalating capacity constraints of aging generation assets, fired by fossil fuels, that dominate the sector,"" Prof Chester said.

health	South East Coast Ambulance Service issues New Year's Eve plea	"An ambulance service that covers four counties has called for support from the public ahead of New Year's Eve.
South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) urged people to only call 999 for genuine emergencies.
NHS services in the South East continue to face sustained pressure, with Surrey and Sussex NHS Trust, Medway Maritime Hospital and Secamb all declaring critical incidents this month.
Demand is expected to remain high across the New Year period.
Secamb is responsible for covering Brighton & Hove, East Sussex, West Sussex, Kent, Surrey, and North East Hampshire.
Last year, the trust said it answered about 1,000 999 calls in the seven hours from 20.00 GMT on 31 December.
rating New Year's Eve are urged to plan their evenings, including how they get home, ensuring they look out for others, and, if drinking alcohol, remembering the impact excessive drinking can have on health and emergency services.
Emma Williams, Secamb executive director for operations, said: ""We have faced significant pressure on our services for many weeks but we know that New Year's Eve can bring additional challenges.""
Ms Williams wants people to celebrate ""sensibly"" and says she understands how the decisions of individuals can impact an ""already stretched ambulance service"".
""I would like to thank all our staff and volunteers for their hard work and professionalism at this busy time and urge the public to show their support by using NHS services wisely,"" she added.
ublic is asked to help Secamb manage pressure by reserving 999 for genuine emergencies and making use of alternatives such as the 111 service, when incidents are not so serious.
Meanwhile, Chief Medical Officer for NHS Kent and Medway, Dr Kate Langford, urged people to be ""very, very selective"" when using emergency services amid an ""incredibly challenging"" period due to flu and Covid.
She said using 999 or an emergency department for something not life threatening could be ""delaying the care of someone who does have a life threatening condition"".
""Anything people can do to avoid using those routes unless it really is an emergency is greatly appreciated,"" she added.

politics	Rishi Sunak: Leaders react to next Conservative PM	"Politicians and other leaders have been reacting to news that Rishi Sunak is to be the new prime minister. 
He faces a number of challenges including a cost-of-living crisis, a war in Europe as well as pressure to get Stormont working again.
In May, Sinn Féin was returned as the assembly's largest party, however, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) blocked the forming of an executive.
DUP withdrew in protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
As it stands, unless an executive is formed by 00:01 BST on Friday 28 October, people in Northern Ireland could, once again, be heading to the polls.
Mr Sunak has received a mixed reaction from the Stormont party leaders and senior politicians in the Republic of Ireland.
Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O'Neill has said Rishi Sunak must ""prioritise the restoration of the executive"" and ""respect democracy"".
""In May, people voted for change. To make politics work,"" she said, referencing her party's success in the assembly election when it was returned with the most number of seats.
""I've been ready to form an executive with others to help workers and families under real pressure with the cost of living crisis.""
Sir Jeffrey Donaldson congratulated Mr Sunak on his victory in the Conservative leadership contest and said the challenge for the new PM remains to deal with the Northern Ireland Protocol.
DUP leader said Mr Sunak must ""restore Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom"". 
""There may be a focus on the unity of the Conservative Party, but the unity of our United Kingdom must be protected,"" Sir Jeffrey said.  
""If the prime minister wants to see a fully-functioning Stormont, then he must deal with it once and for all. 
""Delivering that solution would be a very powerful signal that that he is focused on building a better future for everyone.""
Alliance leader Naomi Long said Mr Sunak ""must prioritise reform of the institutions to end ransom politics"" and called on him to ""take the opportunity to have a fresh approach to Northern Ireland"".
""The lack of an executive is compounding the cost-of-living crisis and the unprecedented pressures on our public services and finances,"" Ms Long said. 
""Rishi Sunak needs to recognise, even if a solution to the protocol can be agreed with the EU, there remains an inherent instability at the heart of our institutions.""
Ms Long described the protocol as ""only the latest in a long line of grievances to have collapsed Stormont"" and called for reform of the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland.
Alliance leader said the prospect of fresh Stormont elections, with or without a deal on the Northern Ireland Protocol, ""solves nothing"".
Doug Beattie said that one of the new prime minister's priorities ""must be resolving the political impasse"" and ""dealing with the issues caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol"". 
Ulster Unionist leader said: ""Northern Ireland cannot continue to be used as political football between the United Kingdom and the EU. 
""The Protocol must be replaced with a deal that works for everyone.""
Mr Beattie said that ""everyone knows what needs to be done and now is the time to be getting on with it"".
Colum Eastwood branded the process in which Rishi Sunak succeeds Liz Truss as prime minister as a ""farce"".
Mr Eastwood said Mr Sunak had no mandate to serve as prime minister and urged him to call a general election. 
""It is completely illegitimate and an affront to democracy for the Tories to elevate Rishi Sunak to the position of prime minister with no mandate whatsoever,"" the SDLP leader said. 
""Mr Sunak's predecessors have completely destroyed the public's confidence in politics and public service and wrecked the economy.
""He should not be allowed another two years to desperately attempt to clean up their mess.""
Jim Allister said the new prime minister's actions on the Northern Ireland Protocol will determine ""how we will judge him"".
UV leader said the protocol is a ""core constitutional issue which he must deal with"" and said this ""sovereignty issue"" will determine the future of Stormont.
(Irish PM) congratulated Mr Sunak on becoming Tory leader, saying: ""I look forward to working with you, as British PM, on the important issues we face on these islands, and globally.""
ánaiste [Irish deputy prime minister] Leo Varadkar said he looked forward to working with Mr Sunak.
In a tweet, Mr Vardakar said: ""These are challenging times of war, inflation, global uncertainty. I look forward to the UK working with Ireland and the EU as friends and allies in the years ahead.""
European Council President Charles Michel offered his congratulations to Rishi Sunak. 
With UK-EU talks ongoing over the Northern Ireland Protocol, Mr Michel said in a tweet: ""Working together is the only way to face common challenges... and bringing stability is key to overcoming them.""
Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said the Irish government would work ""in partnership"" with Rishi Sunak's administration in response to the collapse of power sharing in Northern Ireland, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reports.
Speaking in Galway on Monday, Mr Coveney hoped both governments would work with the DUP to see if an executive could be formed to avoid an ""unnecessary election""."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63376833
health	Mental health: Former patient shares psychiatric unit diary	"Niamh Brownlee talks about penning a hospital diary
""I am the people I was always scared of - insane and imprisoned in hospital. What if they decide I'm too mad and I never leave again?""
Five years ago, like so many people do, Niamh Brownlee was keeping a daily diary. 
But hers was being written in a psychiatric hospital. Gripped by depression and bulimia, she was admitted in the spring of 2017 aged 24.
Niamh was consumed by dark thoughts she believed she could never share with anyone, not least because she feared infecting others with the darkness.
Afraid and confused, she detailed her agony, frustration and inner turmoil on the page. Now, having been down a long road to recovery, Niamh has published that diary. 
It covers the 31 days she spent as an inpatient and, according to Northern Ireland's mental health champion Prof Siobhan O'Neill, it can offer health care providers a crucial insight into the experiences of patients. 
""The diary became a way for me to offload everything that was in my head and to try to understand how I had ended up in hospital,"" she told BBC News NI.
""Looking in, there was no reason this had happened to me. I had a family and friends and a job and a social life. I remember thinking: 'How have I gotten here?' 
""The diary gave me the space to try to work that out.""
In the diary, Struggling to Breathe, she describes the daily routine of the hospital and interactions with other patients and staff, all at a time when she was at her most unwell.
On her second day in hospital, Niamh wrote: ""I'm afraid that if I speak or open up, the screaming and crying and thrashing in my head will make its way out of my mouth and everyone will hear and be disgusted and horrified."" 
And later: ""My biggest fear is that if I open my mouth it could spread to my friends and family and take them over too.""
Niamh said she now realises that part of why she became so unwell was because she kept her feelings a secret for so long. 
""The shame I felt for having depression was enough to completely overwhelm me. 
""Through all the work I've done to recover, I've realised there was nothing to be ashamed of. I have nothing to feel guilty about for becoming unwell.""
She added that it was routine for her ""to wake up every morning and think I don't want to be here anymore, I hate myself, I don't offer anything"".
""I can hear now that that's shocking, but for me it had become my every day. I don't think I could have been more unwell."" 
Now, after years of therapy with mental health charities and voluntary organisations, she said she is in a great place.
Once she was discharged and back at home she put the diary away in a box. 
""I suppose I felt I didn't need it anymore. It was only during [the pandemic] lockdown that I found it again.
""When I read it, I was just so shocked. I needed to sit with it for a while. 
""I thought: 'When I was ill I would have really loved to have read something like that.' To hear someone else's experience and hear about what helped them and how they were able to recover.""
Prof O'Neill said it was courageous to publish the diary, describing it as ""a really impressive and detailed testament"". 
""I think it's really important we know about the experience of service users and patients in our hospitals because we have so much to learn from that,"" she added.
Prof O'Neill said the diary is also now a book that will give people hope: ""It's a story about getting through difficult times. 
""Not everyone recovers but many people get to a point where they can live really good lives and that's a story that needs to be told.""

health	Surrey and Sussex NHS Trust declares critical incident	"A record number of patients going to A&E has led Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust to declare a critical incident.
rust said the problems were being made worse through an increase in staff sickness.
One doctor from Brighton, who has worked in A&E for 22 years, said he has seen ""nothing like this"".
Medway Maritime Hospital and the South East Coast Ambulance Service both declared critical incidents this month.
A Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust spokesperson said it faced challenges in discharging patients who were well enough to leave hospital, to create capacity for patients coming in.
rust took the decision to declare a critical incident in order to be able to take additional steps to maintain safe services for patients and cope with the growing pressures.
A spokesman said: ""Due to the significant ongoing pressure on local NHS services, alongside the need to act swiftly to ensure patients continue to receive safe, high quality care, Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust has declared a critical incident.""
In a further statement released on Thursday, deputy chief executive Paul Simpson said the trust had seen ""some improvement"" following a significant number of discharges.
""Preparations are being made to deal with the expected pressures over the weekend,"" he added.
Dr Robert Galloway, Consultant in Emergency Medicine at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, said hospitals were facing deep pressures. 
rust said essential services remain fully open for anyone who needs them and those requiring urgent medical help should continue to come forward. All time critical and cancer surgery continue unaffected.
People should continue to attend planned appointments unless contacted.

health	Linden Centre: Alarm 'possibly would' prevent patient's absconding	"A 23-year-old man may have been prevented from fleeing a mental health unit if all staff were wearing their security alarms, an inquest heard.
Jayden Booroff was found dead after absconding from the Linden Centre in Chelmsford, Essex, on 23 October 2020.
A coroner heard a nurse tried to ""grab"" Mr Booroff as he fled, but was not carrying her alarm to alert colleagues.
Doreen Mhone, the matron at the time, said the alarm ""possibly would have"" prevented the incident.
Ms Mhone, who was overseeing three acute wards and is now a service manager, said staff are told to bring their Pinpoint alarms to each shift.
Mr Booroff, described as a talented musician, was sectioned in October 2020 and taken to the Linden Centre, run by the Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust.
quest was told he had a history of undiagnosed mental health issues, and had previously been treated at The Lakes in Colchester.
He went missing at about 19:45 BST and his body was found near Chelmsford railway station about two hours later.
Jurors also heard staff were reminded in 2017 to ensure doors were closed behind them after an inpatient ""tailgated"" a nurse out of the building.
Area coroner Sonia Hayes asked Ms Mhone why a similar incident happened nine days later.
Ms Mhone admitted staff were likely to have been unaware of the new guidance, but added: ""We would look at the incident not as an isolated incident, and try to ascertain where it went wrong, have a discussion with the team basically, on what they've learnt from that incident.""
Mr Booroff's keyworker on the ward admitted she went on annual leave on 22 October having not completed his care plan.
She told jurors Mr Booroff did not engage with her, adding: ""When I came back to work on the Wednesday [the following week] I had paperwork ready to sit with Jayden because I really believed that after the weekend and a few days of rest he might have been able to engage better with myself.
""I had the kind of view that he was into music and arts, so I really wanted to sit with him and see where he wanted to go following admission.""
urt heard the junior nurse had not read all of Mr Booroff's previous care notes, which were more than 70 pages long and included suicidal thoughts, and had not updated his risk assessment.
""You can navigate through the system and look at different case notes and histories, but it is not a simple task of clicking and showing all [the records] rolling one after another,"" she said.
wo-week inquest at Essex Coroner's Court is due to conclude on Friday.

technology	India gambles on building a leading drone industry	"Newly qualified drone pilot Uddesh Pratim Nath is excited about the opportunities his new skills have opened up for him.
""Being certified has opened new avenues for me. I have been working with different industries like survey mapping, asset inspection, agriculture and many others,"" he says. 
Drones come in all shapes and sizes. The smaller ones typically have three of four rotors and can carry something small like a camera. The biggest, usually used by the military, look more like aeroplanes and can carry substantial payloads.
Mr Nath, 23, had been designing drones, but decided that being certified to fly them would bring more job satisfaction and financial rewards.
A five-day course was enough to get him started, and he's now flight-testing drones that will be used for mapping.
Next he wants to master flying heavier and more complicated models.
Mr Nath is reaping the benefits of a big push by the Indian government into the drone industry.
In February this year India banned the import of drones, except for those needed by the military or for research and development.
government wants to develop a home-grown industry that can design and assemble drones and make the components that go into their manufacture.
""Drones can be significant creators of employment and economic growth due to their versatility, and ease of use, especially in India's remote areas,"" says Amber Dubey, former joint secretary at the Ministry of Civil Aviation.
""Given its traditional strengths in innovation, information technology, frugal engineering and its huge domestic demand, India has the potential of becoming a global drone hub by 2030,"" he tells the BBC.
Over the next three years Mr Dubey sees as much as 50bn rupees (£550m; $630m) invested in the sector.
Neel Mehta is the co-founder of Asteria Aerospace, which has been building drones for 10 years. He welcomes the government's efforts to boost the sector. 
It has allowed his company to expand beyond building drones for the defence sector and move into new areas.
""Drone companies now have a clear growth roadmap, large order books and promising future trajectory. In India, we now have drones being used in real-world, impactful large-scale applications, while being economically viable,"" says Mr Mehta.
Currently drones do all sorts of jobs in India. Police use them for monitoring the traffic and border security forces use them to search for smugglers and traffickers. 
re also increasingly common in the farming sector, where they are used to monitor the health of crops and spray them with fertiliser and pesticides.
However, despite the excitement and investment around India's drone industry, even those in the sector advise caution.
""India has set a goal of being a hub of drones by 2030, but I think we should be cautious because we at present don't not have an ecosystem and technology initiatives in place,"" says Rajiv Kumar Narang, from the Drone Federation of India.
He says the industry needs a robust regulator that can oversee safety and help develop an air traffic control system for drones.
will be particularly important as the aircraft become larger, says Mr Narang.
""Initiatives have to come from the government. A single entity or a nodal ministry has to take this forward if we want to reach a goal of being the hub by 2030,"" he says.
India also lacks the network of firms needed to make all the components that go into making a drone. 
At the moment many parts, including batteries, motors and flight controllers are imported. But the government is confident an incentive scheme will help boost domestic firms.
""The components industry will take two to three years to build, since it traditionally works on low margin and high volumes,"" says Mr Dubey.
Despite those reservations, firms are confident there will be demand for drones and people to fly them.
Chirag Shara is the chief executive of Drone Destination, which has trained more than 800 pilots and instructors since the rules on drone use were first relaxed in August 2021.
He estimates that India will need up to 500,000 certified pilots over the next five years.
""With 5G around the corner, the drone technology will have the platform to unleash its full potential, especially for long-range, high-endurance operations,"" he says.
More technology of business:
Some companies are already using autonomous drones that use artificial intelligence (AI) to get to their destinations. Could that eliminate the need for drone pilots in the future?
It's not something that concerns newly certified pilot Uddesh Nath.
""Drones will always require a pilot or someone remotely controlling and monitoring them. Different drones require different handling and AI is not yet that advanced.
""Even if it learns to control itself, we cannot teach the drone to react in every situation,"" he says."	/news/business-62966802
business	Germany takes control of stakes in Rosneft oil refineries	"German government has taken temporary control of two subsidiaries of the Russian energy giant Rosneft.
move by the government puts it in charge of Rosneft's stakes in three refineries in the country.
udes a key facility in the northeast of the country which supplies around 90% of Berlin's fuel, and in which Rosneft held a majority stake.
Germany's economy ministry said the move was necessary to counteract an impending threat to energy security.
In a similar move in April, Germany took control of subsidiaries of Russian gas giant Gazprom.
On Friday, the German government handed control of the PCK Schwedt refinery in Brandenburg to the national energy regulator, along with stakes in two other refineries in the south of the country.
my ministry said the move was necessary because critical service providers and customers were no longer willing to work with Rosneft, putting the continued operation of the refineries under threat.
Schwedt refinery is Germany's fourth-largest and is the main supplier of petrol, diesel and aviation fuel for Berlin and the surrounding area. Rosneft has a 54% stake in the facility. 
refinery has received all its crude from Russia via the Druzhba pipeline since it was built in the 1960s. Parts of western Poland are also supplied by Schwedt.
It's less than a year since Rosneft agreed to buy out Shell's holding in PCK, a move that would have given it more than 90% ownership of the vital Schwedt refinery.
was scuppered by the Ukraine war. Now the German government has control - a symbol of the vast changes imposed on Europe's energy sector by the conflict.
In happier times, the refinery would take in vast quantities of crude brought from central Russia through the Druzbha pipeline, and pump out refined products for Berlin and Brandenburg.
But with Germany having pledged to boycott Russian oil, even though the pipeline itself is not covered by the EU's forthcoming embargo, new sources of supply will have to be found.
With Rosneft in charge that was seen as an impossible task. There were concerns in Berlin that the Russian firm would simply suspend operations at the plant, rather than use non-Russian oil.
w been removed - although it's not yet clear where alternative supplies will come from. 
Rosneft Deutschland, which accounts for about 12% of German oil processing capacity, will fall under the trusteeship of the Federal Network Agency regulator, which said the original owner no longer had authority to issue instructions. The regulator was also handed control of Rosneft subsidiary RN Refining and Marketing.
""With the trusteeship, the threat to the security of energy supply is countered and an essential foundation stone is set for the preservation and future of the Schwedt site,"" Germany's economy ministry said.
It claimed critical suppliers such as insurance companies, IT providers and banks were no longer willing to work with Rosneft, either with the subsidiaries themselves or through the refineries.
Federal Network Agency has also taken control of Rosneft Deutschland's shares in the MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe and Bayernoil refinery in Vohburg. Rosneft owns 28% and 24% stakes respectively.
Germany needs to stop Russian oil imports by the end of the year under European sanctions imposed over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
ministry said Friday's move included a package to ensure the Schwedt refinery could receive oil from alternative routes.
It is unclear who could step in to replace Rosneft as operator of the refinery. Shell, which owns a 37.5% stake in Schwedt, has wanted to withdraw for some time.
Germany said this week it would step up lending to energy firms at risk of being crushed by soaring gas prices after Russia cut supplies to Europe in retaliation for Western sanctions.
German utility Uniper said on Wednesday that the government might take a controlling stake, saying an earlier state rescue package worth €19bn euros was no longer enough.
government has also put SEFE, formerly known as Gazprom Germania, under trusteeship after Russian energy giant Gazprom ditched it in April."	/news/business-62924071
business	EasyJet holiday bookings up despite cost-of-living crisis	"People are protecting their spending on holidays despite the cost-of-living crisis, the boss of EasyJet has said.
Johan Lundgren told the BBC the airline had seen strong demand for flights over half term, Christmas and New Year despite the ""pressure"" on households.
However, he said demand outside peak periods remained below usual levels.
It came as the low-cost carrier reported a sharp bounceback in sales and narrowed its losses for the year to 30 September.
mpany said it had faced ""multiple headwinds"" in the period, including Covid restrictions and the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which drove up fuel prices.
However, Mr Lundgren told the BBC's Today programme that there was ""a great deal of pent-up demand"" this summer despite the uncertainty surrounding the state of the economy.
""At the same time we see there is a strong demand in the peak periods,"" he said, adding that budget airlines tended to do well in downturns because ""people gravitate towards value"".
According to a survey of 2,000 people conducted by EasyJet, 64% plan to fly abroad in 2023, while 70% said that they would prioritise a holiday over other expenditure in their yearly budget.
Many said they would cut back on other discretionary spending, such as eating out or buying new clothes, to ensure they could travel abroad.
However, Mr Lungren said the airline needed to do more to ""stimulate"" demand outside peak periods and there were ""big cost increases coming towards the industry"".
Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is running at a 41-year high in the UK, as energy and food prices have soared.
EasyJet said that, like all airlines, it faced cost pressures including higher fuel costs, a stronger US dollar and demands for higher wages. 
Mr Lundgren declined to say how much ticket prices for next summer could rise by.
Rival budget carrier Ryanair has said its prices are rising, with boss Michael O'Leary warning that the era of the €10 ticket is over.
rline's average fare would rise from around €40 (£33.75) last year to roughly €50 over the next five years, he told the BBC in August.
According to a recent BBC survey of more than 4,000 adults, 85% are worried about the rising cost of living, up from 69% in a similar poll in January.
As a result, nine in 10 people are trying to save money by delaying putting the heating on."	/news/business-63791613
sports	Six Nations 2022: What is the tournament's greatest match of all time?	"The Six Nations has delivered some of the most memorable matches in rugby history, but which was the greatest of them all?
Former British and Irish Lions captain Sam Warburton and ex-England scrum-half Danny Care debate and discuss that question on the latest episode of Six Nations Greatest.
x matches they came up with are ranked in reverse order below. Take a trip down memory lane, then rank them yourself at the bottom of this page.
What happened: Scotland led 24-14 with seven minutes to go in Cardiff, but a yellow card for replacement hooker Scott Lawson gave Wales hope. 
Leigh Halfpenny scored under the posts in the 77th minute and, after Scotland's Phil Godman was sin-binned, Stephen Jones took three points to level things at 24-24 with 15 seconds remaining. 
With the clock in red, Shane Williams found his way over to seal victory as the Cardiff crowd exploded with joy.
Warburton: It was my first Six Nations campaign and I just remember Wales being completely outplayed. We were chasing the game. 
I remember running back to the halfway line with Johnathan Thomas and I remember the noise was so loud celebrating and we were looking at each other talking, from about a metre away, I could see his mouth moving but could hear nothing. It was just a wall of noise. 
You hardly ever win in that dramatic fashion. At international level you get one of those every four or five years.
What happened: England travelled to Cardiff chasing a Grand Slam in the Championship decider. Wales, beaten at home by Ireland in round one, needed a winning margin of at least seven points to take the title. 
As England's discipline crumbled, Wales led by six at the break but two second-half tries from wing Alex Cuthbert helped the hosts to a record winning margin of 27 points.
Warburton: We did our anthem and it was out of this world. It was ridiculous. My single greatest moment, without a doubt. Emotionally that game drained us. 
People probably think that we had the biggest party of the year but I remember going back to the hotel, most of us sat down, had a bottle of beer and we literally just sat there for about three hours. It was just an enormous weight off our shoulders.
Care: We weren't prepared for what was to hit us in that caldron, that atmosphere we met. It was all Wales and we couldn't wrestle back any momentum. It was probably one of the harshest lessons I've learnt.
What happened: Wales went to Paris seeking a Grand Slam and, after a fast-scoring start for both sides, Josh Adams' try edged the visitors ahead. Victory seemed secure when they led by 10 points with three minutes remaining. 
France lost Paul Willemse to a red card, before two Welsh players were sin-binned and with the man advantage, Charles Ollivon made it across the try-line in the 77th minute. With the clock in red, Brice Dulin crossed to break Welsh hearts.
Warburton: That was agonising because it would have been Alun Wyn Jones' second Grand Slam as captain. It just shows how tough the Six Nations is… to win away from home and to win a Championship. Wales did everything they had to do for 79 minutes and 50 seconds but they lost in the end.
What happened: Ireland travelled to Wales seeking their first Grand Slam in 61 years. Wales led 6-0 at the break thanks to two Stephen Jones penalties, but Brian O'Driscoll's pick-and-go try and an incredible take by Tommy Bowe down the right wing put Ireland ahead. 
wo more penalties from Jones brought Wales to within two points and his 76th-minute drop-goal seemed to seal victory. But Ronan O'Gara scored a drop-goal of his own with two minutes remaining to make Irish rugby history.
Warburton: It was such a dramatic away win for Ireland that went right to the wire. For the two seconds it takes to score a drop-goal, the whole stadium holds their breath. Maybe not the most entertaining game from minute one to 80 but the significance it has for Ireland puts it in our top six.
What happened: England travelled to Dublin hoping for a first Grand Slam since 1995, having lost on the final weekend in several recent attempts. Ireland were looking to secure a first clean sweep since 1948. 
floodgates opened in the second half as Mike Tindall crossed, Will Greenwood made it over twice and Dan Luger scored. Jonny Wilkinson added 15 points from the boot - including two drop-goals - to complete a comprehensive win.
Warburton: England just did a demolition job and I remember watching it thinking that's what cut-throat, ruthless, world-class dominating teams do. Away at Ireland is one of the hardest away games you can have. To go there and deliver with such dominance sent a message to the rest of the world.
Care: It was such a unique game in that both teams were going for the Slam [on the final day]. It was all to play for.
What happened: A heavy defeat for Scotland seemed certain when England raced into a 31-point lead after half an hour. A second-half blitz by Scotland made it 31-31 and Sam Johnson looked to have sealed victory when he scored in the 76th minute. But George Ford crossed at the death to complete a remarkable draw.
Care: This for me was a crazy Six Nations game. For entertainment value, this is a 10 out of 10. Those moments when you need an ice-cool player - George Ford was the man. I don't think we'll see a game like that again.

entertainment	Brian Eno on how Woodbridge helped create ambient music	"""father of ambient music"" has been speaking about the influence of US airbases on his musical education.
Brian Eno, the former synth player with Roxy Music, has worked as a collaborator and producer with world-famous artists and bands including David Bowie, U2 and Coldplay.
Eno returned to his birthplace of Suffolk at the weekend to open the Woodbridge Ambient Music Festival. 
He said he was happy ambient music had returned to Woodbridge. 
f a postman, now in his 70s, Eno lived in Woodbridge for 18 years. 
He attended Ipswich Civic College in the 1960s where he studied painting and experimental music. 
festival audience at St Mary's Church heard about the influence of the nearby US air force bases at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge, since vacated by the Americans.
He said Woodbridge then had a population of about 4,000 locals with some 17,000 Americans within a five-mile radius. 
He described hordes of large Cadillac cars regularly getting stuck in the narrow Suffolk lanes.
""We had something like 11 or 12 coffee bars with jukeboxes... which had almost exclusively American Southern R&B music,"" he said.
""So there was an entirely different music world here than almost anywhere in England.
""What was playing in these jukeboxes was so much better than the English version of rock n roll at that time."" 
Eno said it was those formative experiences that got him ""thinking about music"".
""What became very clear was that you had to search out good music. You couldn't just switch on the radio and get it automatically,"" he said. 
""I eventually ended up exchanging cassette tapes with other people who were into music, and finding I liked tapes where the music did not change very much, where there was not much variety.""
Eno said in the 1960s ""albums always had the idea that there had to be variety"".
""So you'd have a fast song and a slow song and another fast song. The assumption being, nobody would want to stay in the same mood for more than three-and-a-half minutes,"" he said. 
""I was very clear that I liked staying in the same mood for hours on end if I could.
""I remember I used to take walks towards Kyson Point [overlooking the River Deben estuary] and I used to imagine what would it be like if you could make music like a painting.""
Eno said he liked music ""that stayed still, so that you were the person that did the moving in relation to them"".
By the time he got to art school, he had begun listening to left-field classical composers like Philip Glass, Terry Riley and Steve Reich who were creating what has been termed as minimal music. 
r sounds often had an ""intense repetition"" that was attractive to the young Eno, but he still felt ""it was all a bit too spectacular"".
musician said it was ""really here in Woodbridge where I started imagining this idea of a kind of endless, rather still, music"".
He began making ambient records in the 1970s.
""I came up with the idea of ambient music. Of course it wasn't just me - there were a lot of people who also felt it in the air and wanted to work in that musical area - I just gave it a name.""
Eno was speaking to an audience about his musical connection to the area just before introducing tabla player Talvin Singh and pianist Tom Rogerson.
He ended by saying: ""I'm here just to introduce this concert and to say how glad I am that ambient music has come back to Woodbridge. I hope you enjoy it.""

politics	Rishi Sunak backtracks on £10 missed NHS appointment fines	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has scrapped a Tory leadership campaign pledge he made to fine patients in England £10 if they miss GP or hospital appointments. 
He made the pledge during this summer's leadership contest against Liz Truss. 
Mr Sunak had argued it was ""not right"" some patients were failing to turn up, taking slots from those in need. 
But a No 10 spokeswoman said that, after ""listening to GPs"", the government decided it was ""not the right time"" for the policy. 
She added that Mr Sunak wanted to deliver ""a stronger NHS and the sentiment remains that people should not be missing their appointments and taking up NHS time"".
Critics of the proposal included doctors' union the British Medical Association (BMA), which said it would ""make matters worse"" and threaten the NHS's principle of free care at the point of need.
BMA welcomed the decision to scrap the plan and said it ""cannot be brought back to the table later down the line"".
It said ""punishing"" patients was not the answer to the many reasons people miss appointments, and the policy would ""only deter the most vulnerable from seeking the help they need, worsen health inequalities, and ultimately undermine the essential trust between doctor and patient"".
Instead, the BMA said the government must work to improve pay and other conditions to ensure the NHS has safe levels of staff.
Reflecting a similar view, the Royal College of GPs said the plans would have disadvantaged some of the NHS's most vulnerable patients.
Chairman of the college Prof Martin Marshall said the move would ""simply have been tinkering at the edges given the scale of the crisis facing GPs and our teams"".
Outlining the policy in July, Mr Sunak said patients would be given the ""benefit of the doubt"" the first time they missed an appointment without providing sufficient notice, but further absences would incur a £10 charge.
Fines would also be waived in exceptional circumstances, such as if a patient had an emergency. 
He explained the system would be ""temporary"" as backlogs caused by the pandemic were cleared.
But he gave few details of the how the system would work, writing in the Sunday Telegraph: ""If we have people who are now showing up and taking those slots away from people who need [them], that's not right.
""I'm all for a healthcare system that's free at the point of use, but not one that's free at the point of misuse.""
Asked if other pledges on the NHS made during the summer leadership campaign still stood, she said Mr Sunak's ""initial ideas"" over summer would be discussed with cabinet ministers and any announcements would be ""set out in due course"". 
Mr Sunak had also pledged to eliminate one-year waiting times by September 2024, and get the number of people waiting for non-urgent treatment in England falling by next year. 
He pledged to do this by boosting the number of ""diagnostic hubs"" outside hospitals, including by repurposing empty High Street shops. He also pledged to reform dentists' NHS contract, and ring fence the annual £3bn NHS dentistry budget.

me as Mr Sunak met patients and staff at Croydon University Hospital in his first visit as prime minister. 
A patient was filmed telling the prime minister he needed to ""try harder"" to pay NHS staff more.
Mr Sunak replied ""he would take that away"" following the exchange.

business	House prices climb 11% despite cost of living squeeze	"House prices are continuing to rise despite the growing cost of living crisis.
Nationwide said prices climbed 11% in the last 12 months, although the rise over the last month was just 0.1%.
""The housing market has retained a surprising degree of momentum,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist.
But he said that there were ""tentative signs of a slowdown in activity"".
July figure was slightly ahead of June's annual rise of 10.7% and left the average house at £271,209.
""Demand continues to be supported by strong labour market conditions, where the unemployment rate remains near 50-year lows and with the number of job vacancies close to record highs,"" said Mr Gardner.
""At the same time, the limited stock of homes on the market has helped keep upward pressure on house prices.""
Bank of England is expected to increase interest rates by as much as 0.5% on Thursday when and that could ""exert a cooling impact on the market"" he said.
""We continue to expect the market to slow as pressure on household budgets intensifies in the coming quarters, with inflation set to reach double digits towards the end of the year.""
First-timer buyer mortgage completions remain around 5% above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Nationwide, despite the rising affordability pressures caused by the cost of living squeeze.
""First-time buyer numbers remain strong but that is likely to reflect significant financial input from the Bank of Mum and Dad, as deposit levels rise along with house prices and interest rates,"" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients.
Borrowers remained extremely keen to secure a fixed-rate mortgage before rates go up again, as they are expected to later this week, he said. ""Minds are focused on getting deals done before the cost of borrowing inevitably rises further still.""
""Today's market is being fuelled by people's desperation to find a home before interest rates rise further and the cost of living crisis bites deeper,"" said Nicholas Finn, managing director of Garrington Property Finders.
ursday's expected bank rate rise to 1.75% will have a ""dampening effect on the market,"" said Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest.
She predicted the effects of soaring inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze will ""add more pressure on the property sector"".
""There are a barrage of challenges to come - from the surge in energy prices in October, to runaway inflation continuing to outstrip wage growth - and the pressure on household finances will intensify.""
Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said rises in mortgage rates will cause buyer demand to cool further.
""The rate for a two-year 75% loan-to-value fixed-rate mortgage already has increased to 2.88% in June from 1.57% in December - the fastest six-monthly increase since at least 1995,"" she said.
uld rise to about 3.1% by the end of the year if the Bank of England increased rates in line with current market expectations, she added.
If the recession many are predicting sees unemployment rise sharply, the property market will invariably take a hit, said Andrew Montlake, managing director of mortgage broker Coreco.

Police officers have flooded now-empty protest sites, with some protesters saying police have contacted them to seek information on their whereabouts.
Meanwhile the country's health officials say lockdowns should be ""imposed and eased quickly"".
China has recorded record numbers of new cases in recent days.
It is the only major economy with a zero-Covid policy, with local authorities clamping down on even small outbreaks with mass testing, quarantines and snap lockdowns.
Over the weekend, thousands in China took to the streets demanding an end to the strict measures - with some even making rare calls for President Xi Jinping to stand down.
But a heavy police presence in China's major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, seems to have curbed further protests on Monday and Tuesday.
ruling Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, which oversees domestic law enforcement across China, said it was ""necessary to crack down on infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces in accordance with the law"". 
ment, reported by Chinese news agency Xinhua, did not mention the recent demonstrations, which began after a fire in a high-rise block in Urumqi, western China, killed 10 people on Thursday. 
Many Chinese believe Covid restrictions in the city contributed to the deaths, although the authorities deny this.
Police officers were seen on Tuesday patrolling in large numbers in parts of Beijing and Shanghai where demonstrations were held at the weekend.
re were also reports of around 150 officers showing up at a busy shopping area in the southern city of Shenzhen after rumours of a planned protest there circulated on social media.
Also on Tuesday, Chinese health officials said the authorities would work to reduce ""inconvenience"" caused by the Covid pandemic.
Mi Feng, spokesperson of China's National Health Commission (NHC), told reporters that lockdowns should be ""imposed and eased quickly"" and that ""excessive control measures should be continuously rectified"".
Health officials earlier called for more targeted Covid measures - saying complaints over tough curbs were a result of the ""arbitrary"" local roll-outs, rather than national guidelines.
In southern Guangdong province, authorities announced changes to local Covid policy on Tuesday evening, allowing some close contacts of Covid cases to quarantine at home rather than in state facilities. 
Elsewhere, the UK has summoned the Chinese ambassador for a meeting after a BBC journalist, Ed Lawrence, was beaten and briefly detained while covering anti-government lockdown protests on Sunday."	/news/world-asia-china-63796135

technology	Elon Musk suspends Kanye West from Twitter for inciting violence	"Kanye West has been suspended from Twitter and accused of ""inciting violence"" over offensive tweets - just two months after his last ban.
US rapper, who now goes by the name Ye, posted a series of erratic tweets - one of which appeared to show a symbol combining a swastika and a Jewish star.
witter's new boss Elon Musk was asked by one user to ""fix Kanye"".
West had ""violated our rule against incitement to violence"", Musk tweeted.
""Account will be suspended,"" Musk wrote in a Twitter post.
Also on Thursday, during an interview with US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and with his face covered in a mask, West praised Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and ranted about sin, pornography and the devil.
f the UK's Holocaust Educational Trust described West's comments as ""repulsive and sickening"". 
""These comments mixed with his high profile and huge following have dangerous consequences,"" chief executive Karen Pollock said.
In recent months West has caused controversy with a series of antisemitic and racist remarks - leading to clothing giant Adidas cutting ties with the rapper.
West was initially locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts after posting antisemitic messages in October. Both platforms removed West's posts - which accused rapper Diddy of being controlled by Jewish people - saying the star had violated policies on hate speech.
me in response to a backlash against his show at Paris Fashion Week, where he wore a T-shirt carrying the slogan ""White Lives Matter"".
Anti-Defamation League in the US branded his phrase ""hate speech"" and attributed it to white supremacists, who began using it in 2015 in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.
Earlier this year, West was suspended from Instagram for 24 hours in March after using a racial slur in reference to comedian Trevor Noah.
In 2018, singer Will.i.am led a backlash against West after he claimed the enslavement of African-Americans over centuries may have been a ""choice"" - remarks he later tried to clarify.
His latest Twitter ban comes hours after the right-wing social media platform Parler - which styles itself as a ""free speech"" alternative to mainstream platforms - said West could no longer buy the firm.
In a statement, Parlement Technologies said: ""The company has mutually agreed with Ye to terminate the intent of sale."" 
firm - which runs the much smaller platform, popular with conservatives and the far right - said the decision was made in mid-November.
""Parler will continue to pursue future opportunities for growth and the evolution of the platform for our vibrant community,"" the firm said in its statement.
Musk took control over Twitter in October and immediately embarked on a series of radical changes within the social media giant - including lifting the bans on controversial accounts.
He has clarified that he had no role in bringing West back on Twitter, saying the account was restored before he acquired the social media platform.
West was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago and has publicly spoken about his challenges with his mental health.
However, medical experts and people who share West's condition have warned that mental health problems do not go hand-in-hand with antisemitism."	/news/business-63826675
business	Jack Dorsey: Twitter co-founder breaks silence on Elon Musk takeover	"witter co-founder and ex-CEO Jack Dorsey has addressed the mass sackings at his former firm, apologising for growing Twitter ""too quickly"".
Half of the social media giant's staff are being fired, a week after Elon Musk bought it in a $44bn deal.
Billionaire Mr Musk has said he had ""no choice"" but to slash the company's workforce as the firm is losing more than $4m (£3.5m) a day.
witter staff took to the platform to express their anger at the firings. 
In a statement posted on the microblogging site, Mr Dorsey - who quit as CEO in November and left the board of directors in May - said Twitter staff ""are strong and resilient. They will always find a way no matter how difficult the moment. I realise many are angry with me. I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly. I apologise for that.""
""I am grateful for, and love, everyone who has ever worked on Twitter. I don't expect that to be mutual in this moment...or ever…and I understand,"" he added. 
His statement appeared to endorse the need for dismissals at the firm. The 45-year-old Mr Dorsey has been supportive of Mr Musk's takeover.
Back in April when Mr Musk first began his purchase of Twitter, Mr Dorsey said the 51-year-old was the ""singular solution I trust"" and that the South African's takeover was ""the right path...I believe it with all my heart"".
Mr Dorsey created Twitter in 2006 along with Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass. He sent the company's first Tweet, writing ""just setting up my twttr"". 
uts have come across Twitter's 7,500-strong work force, and there are fears it could damage the firm's content moderation efforts. 
Despite the dismissals Mr Musk has said the firm's policies remain ""absolutely unchanged"".
A host of major brands have halted advertising spending with Twitter in recent days, including Volkswagen, General Motors and Pfizer.
Almost all of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising, and Mr Musk has been looking for ways to cut costs and make money in different ways from the platform.
In a move much publicised in advance, Twitter launched a subscription service on Saturday allowing users to buy blue-tick verification on the platform for a monthly fee of $7.99 (£7)."	/news/technology-63527893

technology	Elon Musk: Twitter won't 'take yes for an answer'	"Billionaire Elon Musk has said he aims to complete his purchase of Twitter by the end of the month, but the company ""will not take yes for an answer"".
In a court filing, he said the social media platform had raised concerns about the ""theoretical possibility of a future failure to obtain debt financing"" to pay for the deal.
witter said it did not trust that the offer would come through. 
witter sued Mr Musk in July after he tried to back out of buying the firm.
judge overseeing the case gave the two sides until 28 October to work out a deal, agreeing to put legal proceedings on hold at the request of Mr Musk.
Mr Musk said litigation was no longer necessary, after he said in a surprise move this week that he was prepared to go forward with the original takeover plan, pending receipt of the financing and an end to the legal battle.
""There is no need for an expedited trial to order defendants to do what they are already doing,"" Mr Musk's attorneys wrote in a filing.
""Yet, Twitter will not take yes for an answer. Astonishingly they have insisted on proceeding with this litigation, recklessly putting the deal at risk and gambling with their stockholders interests.""
In its own filing for Delaware Chancery Court on Thursday, Twitter said it was opposed to suspending litigation, calling such a move ""an invitation to further mischief and delay.""
It said it did not trust Mr Musk's promises, noting that one bank helping to finance the deal had testified this week that it had not received any notice from Mr Musk about plans to move forward.
""Defendants can and should close next week,"" the company wrote. ""Until defendants commit to close as required, Twitter is entitled to its day in court.""
Mr Musk announced a plan to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in April. But he backed away from the deal just a few weeks later saying he was concerned that spam accounts on the platform were higher than Twitter had claimed.
witter ultimately sued to force Mr Musk to complete the deal. 
In its lawsuit, Twitter argued Mr Musk was worried about the price he had agreed to pay, after a sharp downturn in the value of tech shares, including Tesla, the electric car company he leads and is the base of much of his wealth.            
Mr Musk was due to be questioned this week as part of the preparation for the trial, which was scheduled to begin 17 October. The trial is now postponed to 28 October to allow a deal to close, according to a court filing. 
Shares in Twitter ended the day down more than 3%, amid investor doubts the deal will go through."	/news/business-63166568
