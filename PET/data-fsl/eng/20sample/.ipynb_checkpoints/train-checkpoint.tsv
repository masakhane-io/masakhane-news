business	Amazon could pay UK shoppers £900m compensation	"Amazon shoppers in the UK could receive a share of £900m in compensation, once a legal claim is submitted against the technology giant. 
roposed claim alleges the company breached competition law and caused customers to pay higher prices.
It is being led by consumer-rights champion Julie Hunter, who says products sold on Amazon.co.uk and the Amazon app obscured better-value deals.
ue to be filed before the end of the month.
Started as an online bookseller, Amazon is now the biggest e-commerce company in the world.
More than 80% of purchases on the site are made via featured offers in the ""buy box"". 
But Ms Hunter alleges independent sellers are excluded from the buy box, even when they offer the same product cheaper or on better terms - thus breaching UK and EU competition law.
""Nine out of 10 shoppers in the UK have used Amazon, according to surveys, and two-thirds use it at least once a month,"" she said. 
Ms Hunter alleges Amazon uses ""tricks of design to manipulate consumer choice and direct customers towards the featured offer in its buy box"".
featured offer is the only one considered and selected by the vast majority of users, many of whom trust Amazon and wrongly assume it is the best deal, according to Ms Hunter.
gal action, to be filed in the Competition Appeal Tribunal, in London, will seek damages from Amazon estimated in the region of £900m.
David Greene, from the London Solicitors Litigation Association, told BBC News the likelihood of success was difficult to assess.
""Clearly Amazon will fight the case at all stages, including class certification, but the tribunal has made a number of orders recently for similar actions, certifying the optout process,"" he said.
""Big tech companies are well resourced to fight.""
Anyone living in the UK who has made purchases on Amazon.co.uk or the Amazon mobile app since October 2016 is an eligible member of the claimant class. 
roposed lawsuit is an optout collective-action claim, which means affected shoppers, on whose behalf the class action is brought, will not pay costs or fees to participate. 
Lesley Hannah, one of the partners at Hausfeld and Co LLP, who are leading the litigation, said: ""Competition laws are there to protect everyone. They ensure that individuals can make genuine and informed choices and are not simply led into making selections which benefit the companies they interact with.
""Fairness is at the heart of competition law - and consumers are not being treated fairly by Amazon."" 
Ms Hunter added: ""Amazon shouldn't be allowed to set the rules in its favour and treat consumers unfairly. That is why I am bringing this action."" 
An Amazon official said: ""This claim is without merit and we're confident that will become clear through the legal process. 
""Amazon has always focused on supporting the 85,000 businesses that sell their products on our UK store - and more than half of all physical product sales on our UK store are from independent selling partners. 
""We always work to feature offers that provide customers with low prices and fast delivery.""
European Commission is pursuing two formal anti-trust investigations into Amazon. 
One, from November 2020, is evaluating the same alleged ""self-preferencing"" by Amazon as is alleged in the UK claim. 
mmission's preliminary finding was the rules and criteria for the buy box unduly favoured Amazon's own retail business and marketplace sellers using its logistics and delivery services. 
It is currently evaluating commitments offered by Amazon to address these concerns.
In July 2022, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced it was investigating Amazon's business practices, including how it set the criteria for selecting of the featured offer. 
CMA indicated its investigation followed on from the European Commission's."	/news/technology-63328589

ft in chronic pain after operations by Prof Sam Eljamel at Dundee's Ninewells Hospital
A damning Scottish government report last month accused NHS Tayside of letting patients down.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he expected NHS Tayside to give the issue the highest priority - a police investigation is also ongoing.
Dozens of patients are also calling for an external and independent review of what happened to them.
ged a protest to highlight their cause outside Ninewells Hospital. 
Scottish government has turned down calls for a public inquiry.
Prof Eljamel, the former head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside in Dundee, harmed dozens of patients before he was suspended in 2013.
He was allowed to voluntarily remove himself from the General Medical Council's register and is now working as a surgeon in Libya.
Elizabeth Rose from L&M MediLaw said she had been approached by some of Eljamel's patients to look into any harm they experienced under his care, as well as the actions or omissions of Tayside Health Board. 
wyer also backed the patients' calls for a public inquiry.
She said: ""Although our investigations are at very early stages, a public inquiry would allow those affected to understand what happened to them and why.""
Jules Rose was among those protesting outside Ninewells Hospital.
After her operation in 2013, Ms Rose discovered that Prof Eljamel had removed her tear gland instead of a tumour on her brain.
She still has not been told exactly when health bosses knew he was a risk to patients.
Ms Rose said that a class action, or group proceeding as it is known in Scotland, was being considered.
However, she said that a public inquiry was the patients' priority.
She said: ""Patients have been complaining to NHS Tayside for years and they have got nowhere.
""They have got every door closed in their face. 
""Why was Tayside allowing the surgeon to continue butchering people for so many years, what were they doing?
""Where were their systems and processes?
""All these questions need answered by external scrutiny.""
An NHS Tayside spokeswoman said the health board was aware of the protest.
She added: ""We continue to be in contact directly with Ms Rose and have offered her another meeting with the Chair, Chief Executive and Medical Director. 
""Ms Rose has advised that she welcomes this further opportunity for discussion.  
""We are also making arrangements for other patients who wish to discuss their circumstances to be invited to a meeting."" "	/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-63877241

Following an experiment using artificial intelligence (AI), more than 20,000 hidden pools were discovered.
massed some €10m (£8.5m) in revenue, French media is reporting.
Pools can lead to higher property taxes because they boost property value, and must be declared under French law.
ftware, developed by Google and French consulting firm Capgemini, spotted the pools on aerial images of nine French regions during a trial in October 2021. 
regions of Alpes-Maritimes, Var, Bouches-du-Rhône, Ardèche, Rhône, Haute-Savoie, Vendée, Maine-et-Loire and Morbihan were part of the trial - but tax officials say it may now be rolled out nationwide.
re were more than 3.2 million private swimming pools in France in 2020, according to data website Statista, with sales already booming before the Covid pandemic. 
But as more employees worked from home, there was a further surge in pool installations.
According to Le Parisien newspaper, an average pool of 30 sq m (322 sq ft) is taxed at €200 (£170) a year.
x authorities say the software could eventually be used to find undeclared home extensions, patios or gazebos, which also play a part in property taxes.
Antoine Magnant, the deputy director general of public finances, told Le Parisien: ""We are particularly targeting house extensions like verandas. 
""But we have to be sure that the software can find buildings with a large footprint and not the dog kennel or the children's playhouse,"" he added. 
rackdown comes after Julien Bayou, of France's Europe-Ecology Greens party, did not rule out a ban on new private pools. 
Speaking to BFMTV, he said that France needs a ""different relationship to water"" and that the ban would be a ""last resort"". 
""The challenge is not to ban swimming pools, it is to guarantee our vital water needs,"" he said. 
His comments come as France tackles its worst recorded drought that has left more than 100 municipalities short of drinking water.
In July, France had just 9.7mm (0.38in) of rain, making it the driest month since March 1961, the national weather service Meteo-France said.
Irrigation has been banned in much of the north-west and south-east of France to conserve water.

entertainment	The Traitors: What happens when the castle cameras stop rolling?	"Behind the walls of a Scottish castle, a group of 22 people have watched their number dwindle as they are slowly picked off by a ruthless band of killers. Theo Mayne, one of the contestants on the hit BBC reality show The Traitors, explains what life was like as he tried to stay in the game.
""I was paranoid every moment of the day,"" the Leeds-born cheerleading coach says.
""Not only didn't you know who to trust, but you also had Claudia ready to come in and drop a bombshell.""
In the sweeping Scottish Highlands, Claudia Winkleman has played taskmistress for three weeks over an ever-shrinking band of players stationed at Ardross Castle.
Contestants are split into either faithful or traitors, with the former trying to smoke out the latter before they 'murder' them and are forced to leave empty-handed.
faithful can also be banished by their own after a gruelling roundtable discussion where fingers are pointed and accusations fly.
Warning - this article contains spoilers for the series.
""It was savage,"" says Theo. ""I was savage. I called multiple people out. 
""The round tables are tough because people are just clutching at straws. What you see on TV, it happened, it was crazy.""
room was cold and discussions were in-depth, with some players leaving in tears. Faithful Aaron had a panic attack as the spotlight of suspicion mistakenly fell on him.
""The traitors led that round table. The faithfuls were like sheep and just followed others,"" Theo recalls.
Admitting he's ""an emotional person"", the 27-year-old says the experience was intense.
He had to fight back tears as he stood up and told the group, who had just voted for him to go, that he was actually a fellow faithful.
""You don't know who to trust, and when you do trust someone they backstab you,"" he says.
's fate was sealed during the roundtable vote when his friend Amanda, who had previously said she ""100%"" trusted Theo, revealed she believed he could be a traitor too.
Amanda was later unmasked as one of the murderous traitors.
What was that like for Theo?
""It was tough,"" he exclaims.
""I spent so many times with Amanda on and off camera.""
Welfare teams worked with the cast during filming to make sure contestants were happy with the experience.
Before each episode goes out, the group are told what to expect, including what might have made the final edit.
So what happens when the players finish at the end of each day's filming?
Contestants are separated and are transported individually to their off-site accommodation.
won't meet or speak to each other until the next morning, when they are taken back to the country home for their breakfast reunion.
While the faithful toss and turn in the night trying to figure out who could be killing them, the traitors continue filming in the early hours, plotting their next move.
""I don't think I could have been a traitor from the start, but I think if I was given an ultimatum I would have said yes,"" admits Theo.
""Everyone trusted me at that point, so I'd like to be recruited, but I'm a nosy person so I'd have seen who the other traitors were and be like, 'Oh, it's you!'""
Host Claudia Winkleman was ""invested"" in the game and the players, he adds.
""The day I was banished and the cameras stopped rolling, she gave me a tight hold and said, 'it's alright, it'll be OK' and I think I needed someone like that.
""She's just a genuine warm heart, but great to see a savage side to her.""
She joins the group on their challenges - some filmed miles from the castle.

So do the contestants, who filmed the series in May, still stay in touch?
Well, they have a WhatsApp group - and everyone, even traitors - are included, reveals Theo.
During the show, phones become red hot as messages and memes fly in as their drama is relived on TV sets across the nation.
Since his appearance, Theo says he's been recognised everywhere he goes - including while doing his weekly shop at Aldi.
""The support I've had has been phenomenal. It's been overwhelming,"" he smiles.
A mix of hidden and overt cameras captured the action, with almost every moment of their time in the castle filmed, meaning their secretive chats were often recorded.

""I just want to be a beacon of light for people and just show you can come from any background and you can do anything if you work hard.
""There's not enough diverse, gay, multicultural people on TV and we need more of that.

Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA) survey found almost 40% of businesses reported a decrease in spending since May 2021.
Business say the drop-off is due to the cost-of-living crisis and the appeal of international travel. 
ruggle to compete on price with global destinations.
More than 700 tourism businesses across Scotland took part in the survey, which ran from 17 May to 8 June.
A record 55% of businesses reported that their international bookings for June-August were lower in comparison with May 2019 - before the pandemic.
It also highlighted problems with staffing and recruitment, with 60% of hotels saying they are unable to trade effectively at current staffing levels. 
Marc Crothall, STA chief executive, said the report showed recovery from the pandemic was happening at a much slower pace than anticipated and not across all tourism sectors.
He said: ""The cost-of-living crisis is hitting Scotland's tourism sector very hard on many levels.
""People are hesitant about committing to booking a break due to household financial challenges and uncertainty and with the rise of energy prices and supplier costs, many businesses are finding the level of recovery almost static.
""This impacts the ability for our tourism industry to remain competitive globally; we struggle to compete on price and we're unable to retain and attract the quality of staff required to deliver the level of service demanded by today's consumers.""
He added that the disruption caused by rail strikes made it harder for the industry to thrive.
Malcolm Roughead, chief executive of VisitScotland, said the survey underlined some of the challenges facing the tourism industry but also highlighted some positives.
He said: ""There are some encouraging signs with the return of international visitors and consumer research which shows more UK residents expect to take an overnight domestic trip between June and September than in 2021."""	/news/uk-scotland-61881242

Beth Foreman attended Lincoln County Hospital with baby Clio on Friday and left with a penicillin prescription.
She was told it was ""imperative"" her 11-month-old daughter took it that night, but all nearby pharmacies told her they did not have any in stock.
government said there was ""no supplier shortage"" of antibiotics.
Ms Foreman said she called NHS 111 after her daughter became ""poorly and lethargic"" with a bright red rash on her face.
""You could have literally fried eggs on her cheeks, she was irritable, crying and she'd waited for five to six hours in the hospital until she'd been seen.""
Ms Foreman said they left hospital at 23:45 GMT on Friday ""having been told they didn't have penicillin"".
""Off I went in minus two degrees with my 11-month-old baby on my own, with my partner working away, in search of penicillin somewhere in Lincoln.""
She said all overnight pharmacies told her they did not have any supplies, with parents, family and friends all encountering the same problem while attempting to help.
""It was very scary, I spent the whole night very concerned about my daughter and literally searching for what appeared to be a non-existent medication that was very important to her health.""
She said she was advised by the overnight pharmacies to return to the hospital for further advice. 
""After some persuasion and a lengthy discussion at the hospital they did manage to find us the penicillin from an inpatient ward, and claimed it was the last bottle in the building,"" she said.
Clio's father Dean Wain, a lorry driver who was working at the time, said: ""I was worried and upset, I'd been told my daughter's in hospital and my girlfriend was out trying to source medication.
""How can a hospital say you need a medication, and not be able to give it you - where do you go hunting for it at midnight, with a screaming baby?""
Ms Foreman added: ""It's the thought that your child might potentially need this to stop what is initially a minor illness from developing into something very serious, it's terrifying.""
Department of Health and Social Care said there was ""no supplier shortage of antibiotics available to treat strep A"".
A spokesperson said: ""We sometimes have surges for products and increased demand means some pharmacies are having difficulties obtaining certain antibiotics.
""We rely on competition to drive down the prices of generic medicines which generally results in lower prices for the NHS - this means prices can fluctuate, but no company should use this as an opportunity to exploit the NHS.
""Where companies are found to be abusing their dominant position by charging excessive and unfair prices, the Competition and Markets Authority can take action against businesses and individuals engaged in anti-competitive conduct.""

politics	Gavin Williamson: Downing Street looking into bullying claims	"Downing Street has said it is seeking to establish the facts about abusive comments allegedly made by Cabinet Office minister Sir Gavin Williamson.
A senior civil servant told the Guardian Sir Gavin had bullied them and told them to ""slit your throat"".
He has also been reported to the MPs' bullying watchdog over messages to Tory colleague Wendy Morton.
Sir Gavin denies the allegations. No 10 said it was looking into the claims and was prepared to take action.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the language Sir Gavin had used was ""not acceptable"", but No 10 earlier insisted the PM still has full confidence in him.
A series of text messages by Sir Gavin to Tory colleague and then-Chief Whip Wendy Morton were published on Sunday.
In them, he appears to complain MPs not ""favoured"" by then-Prime Minister Liz Truss were being excluded from attending the Queen's funeral at Westminster Abbey.
He accused Ms Morton of ""rigging"" the ticket allocation to punish people - including himself - who were not supportive enough of Ms Truss.
Sir Gavin reportedly warned Ms Morton ""not to push him about"" and that ""there is a price for everything"".
Last month, Ms Morton sent the messages to the Conservative Party after making a formal complaint about Sir Gavin's behaviour.
On Tuesday, she referred Sir Gavin to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). 
ks into claims of parliamentarians and staff who feel they have been bullied or harassed. 
Guardian has reported that the senior civil servant who claims to have been bullied by Sir Gavin has also referred the MP to the ICGS.
Last year, investigations by the ICGS took 216 days on average to complete.
Under the process, complaints are initially assessed by an external investigator. A decision is then made on whether to move to a full investigation.
Downing Street said it was carrying out an informal fact-finding investigation into the comments as well.
rime minister's spokesman said the investigation may act before either of the existing processes are complete.
Meanwhile, Sir Gavin's former deputy when he was chief whip claimed he acted in an ""unethical and immoral"" way in the role. 
Anne Milton, who was deputy chief whip from May 2015 to July 2017, described his behaviour as ""threatening"" and ""intimidating"". 
Ms Milton, who was expelled from the Conservative parliamentary party in 2019 over Brexit and subsequently lost her seat, told Channel 4 News: ""I got the impression that he loved salacious gossip, and would use it as leverage against MPs if the need arose.""
Watch: Sunak on Williamson texts - Not right, not acceptable
In response to the allegations by Ms Morton, Sir Gavin told the Sunday Times: ""I of course regret getting frustrated about the way colleagues and I felt we were being treated.""
Asked if it amounted to bullying, Mr Sunak said ""an independent complaints process"" was under way and it would be ""right to let that process conclude"".
In a separate development, an unnamed Ministry of Defence official told the Guardian Sir Gavin told them to ""slit your throat"" and ""jump out of the window"" when he was defence secretary. 
fficial said they raised concerns to the Ministry of Defence's human resources department but made no formal complaint.
In a statement, Sir Gavin said: ""I strongly reject this allegation and have enjoyed good working relationships with the many brilliant officials I have worked with across government. 
""No specific allegations have ever been brought to my attention.""
Mr Williamson does not deny using the language.
Sir Gavin was defence secretary between 2017 and 2019 under Theresa May, until he was forced to resign after details of Huawei's potential involvement in the UK's 5G network were leaked.
He was brought back into government by Mr Sunak, after helping run the prime minister's leadership campaign.
Labour frontbencher Jonathan Ashworth said Rishi Sunak had shown a ""complete lack of judgement"" in bringing Sir Gavin back into government despite knowing there were allegations against him.
He said Mr Williamson portrayed himself as a ""cartoonish character bullying colleagues"" and that ""it's just not what we need around the cabinet table"".
Sir Gavin was appointed minister without portfolio on the first day of Mr Sunak's premiership. Among his responsibilities are tackling overseas conflict and improving the government's communications. 
Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said Sir Gavin's role in government was ""very important"".
Mr Stride told Times Radio: ""I think Gavin is somebody who, as I say, has particular talents and a particular understanding of the parliamentary party.""
Liberal Democrats are demanding an independent Cabinet Office inquiry into Sir Gavin's remarks.
""Anything less would be an abdication of leadership from Number 10, and make a mockery of Sunak's promise to govern with integrity,"" Lib Dem spokesperson Christine Jardine said."	/news/uk-politics-63555085
business	Government borrowing costs rise after PM's U-turn	"Government borrowing costs rose on Friday afternoon after the prime minister announced another U-turn on the mini-budget.
und, which initially held firm earlier on Friday, also lost ground.
moves came as Liz Truss sacked her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, and said a rise in corporation tax would now go ahead.
However, some economists warned that the latest developments might not be enough to restore the UK's credibility.
""It's unlikely that the removal of Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor and the new plans to cancel the cancellation of the rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25% from next April will be enough on their own to regain the full confidence of the financial markets,"" said Paul Dales, Chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
He also pointed out that despite another U-turn on the 45p tax cut, there are still unfunded tax cuts of about £25bn left over from the mini-budget - down from £45bn originally.
f government borrowing rose across a range of bonds traded on the financial markets following the announcement. 
rest rate - or yield - on bonds due to be repaid in 30 years' time climbed to 4.85%. 
5.17% on 28 September in the aftermath of the mini-budget when Mr Kwarteng set out one of the biggest tax cuts packages seen in decades but did not explain how they would be funded.
Meanwhile, the yield on bonds due to be repaid in five years' time, which underpins the cost of new five-year fixed rate mortgages, jumped to 4.35%.
und - which had jumped on Thursday as speculation mounted about a possible U-turn - also sank by more than 1% to just under $1.12 on Friday before clawing back some losses.
Prime Minister Liz Truss admitted the government's mini-budget had gone ""faster and further"" than many expected. 
""We need to act now to reassure the markets of our fiscal discipline,"" she said.
government also announced that Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign and health secretary, will succeed Mr Kwarteng. He will be the UK's fourth chancellor so far this year and will face big challenges with prices soaring and hikes in interest rates.
Speaking to the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam, leading economist Mohamed El-Arian said that the events seen in the UK over the last few weeks in particular were ""unthinkable"".
""There are already scars. If you had to refinance your mortgage, if you're looking to buy a house - you've been hit,"" he said of the recent market turmoil.
He said Mr Hunt ""needs more measures, he needs to cover more of the unfunded tax cuts that were introduced… most of the damage is recoverable but it needs action and time"".
Investec economist Ellie Henderson described markets as ""dizzy"" over the series of policy reversals and changes.
""Markets seem unconvinced that today's announcement was enough to fully restore confidence in the UK government,"" she said.
government had already U-turned on its plan to scrap the top rate of income tax for people earning £150,000 a year or more. Reducing the tax rate for top earners would have cost £2bn. 
Moving ahead with the increase in corporation tax should add an estimated £18bn a year in tax revenue to the government's coffers.
rime minister added that ""spending will grow less rapidly than previously planned"". 
reasury also confirmed that the incoming chancellor would still deliver the government's ""economic plan"" on 31 October, which will set out how the remaining tax cuts will be funded, and how debts will be reduced.
On Friday, an emergency bond-buying scheme set up by the Bank of England to restore calm in the financial markets following the previous mini-budget will also come to an end. 
government raises money it needs for spending by selling bonds - a form of debt that is paid back plus interest in anywhere between five and 30 years.
Pension funds invest in bonds because they provide a low but usually reliable return over a long period of time.
However, the sharp fall in their value after the mini-budget forced pension funds to sell bonds, threatening to create a ""downward spiral"" in their prices as more were offloaded, which left some funds close to collapse.
rked an emergency intervention by the Bank of England, which has stepped in to buy £19.3bn worth of government bonds.
re has been strong speculation that the Bank will extend the scheme past the Friday deadline.
But on Tuesday, the Bank's governor Andrew Bailey dashed those hopes, telling pension funds: ""You've got three days left now and you've got to sort it out.""
Bethany Payne, global bonds fund manager at Janus Henderson, told the BBC it was not clear whether pension funds have done enough to strengthen their finances.
""The risk is that we don't know how pension funds have used this window of time and whether they have used it effectively by raising cash and doing everything they need to,"" she said.
""So the true test of the market will be this afternoon and Monday morning to see whether they have done enough."""	/news/business-63243918
entertainment	Eurovision scraps jury voting in semi-finals	"Eurovision Song Contest has announced major changes to the voting process at next year's contest.
Professional juries have been scrapped from the semi-finals, meaning that viewers alone will choose who qualifies for the grand final.
Countries who are not competing in the contest will also be allowed to cast votes for the first time.
move comes after it was discovered that six juries traded votes at this year's contest in Turin, Italy.
Irregular voting patterns were detected from Azerbaijan, Georgia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and San Marino, said the EBU, which organises the contest.
jury votes were discounted, and substituted with an aggregate score, calculated from the results of other countries with similar voting records.
In the end, the contest was won by Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra, with the UK's Sam Ryder taking second place.
Liverpool will host the event in 2023.
Professional juries, which comprise professional songwriters and music industry figures, have existed since at least the second Eurovision Song Contest in 1957 (the voting system for the first competition has never been revealed).
Under the current system, their scores are combined with the results of a public vote to determine the overall winner. 
ractice will continue in the final, said the EBU in a press release.
V presenter Nicki Chapman, who has served on the UK jury twice, welcomed the change, saying fans often know more than the professionals.
""There'll be lots of people breathing a sigh of relief, because real Eurovision fans are online months and months in advance. They know every single song, and they'll have their favourites.
""So when Ireland gets knocked out, for example, so many people are disappointed. This [change] gives everybody the chance to put their favourite through and, when it comes to the final, the juries will have 50% of the votes.""
Allowing non-participating countries to vote will reflect ""the global impact of the event,"" said Martin Österdahl, the contest's executive supervisor.
""Everyone watching the show, wherever they live in the world, can cast their votes for their favourite songs.""
Online votes from the ""rest of the world"" will be added together and converted to points that will have the same weight as one participating country in both of the semi-finals and the grand final, the EBU said.
""I love the idea it's going to go global,"" said Chapman, who worked with David Bowie, the Spice Girls and Amy Winehouse before moving into television.
""I wonder whether, say an artist such as Adele might suddenly think, 'Actually, I want to be part of this. This goes out to a global audience, I want to represent the UK'. Wouldn't that be wonderful?""
In the past, Eurovision viewers have frequently voted in opposition to the juries. This year,for example, Ukraine overwhelmingly won the tele-vote at the final, scoring 439 points, but came fourth in the jury vote, with 192.

technology	How flowers are 'put to sleep' for long sea voyages	"Workers in heavy coats shift boxes of flowers from a cold store into a refrigerated container. Once packed, these blooms will travel hundreds of miles by road, in a special 'controlled atmosphere' container from Nairobi to the coast.
On arrival at Kenya's biggest seaport, Mombasa, the container is loaded onto a ship for a voyage to Europe of around 30 days. Despite their lengthy journey, they will still be sold to European shoppers with a vase-life of about a week.
So, how is this possible?
""The flowers will be kept at a temperature of 0.5 degrees celsius throughout the journey,"" says Elizabeth Kimani, the manager of quality and standards at Sian Flowers.
As well as controlling the temperature, the atmosphere system in the container reduces the oxygen level from 20% to 4%, while increasing the carbon dioxide level from 0.4% to 4%. 
gy is all part of the elaborate process of preserving the blooms for as long as possible. 
""Through this [system] you stop all activity in the flowers that, as a result, go into dormancy,"" Ms Kimani says, explaining that the flowers are put to sleep.
A sophisticated tracking system allows staff from the shipping company to monitor the temperature, oxygen and CO2 levels throughout the journey.
But flowers destined for such a long voyage need extra attention to prepare them, as soon as they are picked.
""We harvest them early in the morning, when it's still cool and they will be the first to go into the cold room,"" explains Linda Murungi from grower, Sian Flowers.
Freshly-harvested roses, for instance, are then dipped into a chemical mixture to protect them from the fungus, botrytis.
After that, the stems are put into buckets to absorb a hydration solution so they can survive the thirty days without water. They are also put in a solution that curbs the growth hormone, ethylene, which causes the ageing of the flowers.
Once that process is completed, the flowers are then packed into cartons with holes in the top and bottom, which allow air from the container's system to circulate.
Kenya has become one of the world's biggest flower exporters thanks to its equatorial location, high altitudes and relatively cheap labour, it competes for dominance in the market with Colombia and Ecuador.
For years, the two Latin American countries have been exporting about 10% of their flowers by sea freight to North America and Europe.
As these flowers are at sea for a much shorter period of time, firms exporting from Latin America do not use controlled atmosphere, or post-harvest treatments. 
Kenyan exporters however, have to be extra-careful. There is no direct shipping route in to Europe, instead, containers are transferred in the Middle East from smaller vessels to much larger ones.
""All processes around sea freight require extreme precision - there's no room for shortcuts,"" says Jeroen van der Hulst, chief executive at consulting company, FlowerWatch. ""One mistake and your flowers might arrive as compost in Europe."" 
Kenyan flowers' complex journey involves a higher risk of delay, as containers occasionally miss their transfer window.
rt of Mombasa has also been known for delays and bureaucracy. Another challenge is it also lacks a so-called 'green line' for perishable products - flowers have to queue up with all the other containers.
Due to these challenges, Kenya's flower farmers have, in the past, been wary of sea freight preferring to transport their flowers by air but shifted during the pandemic.
farmers saw the price of air freight soar from around $1.80 per kilo, in January 2020, to around $2.80 per kilo in June 2022, according to Harm-Jan Mostert commercial manager for Africa at Royal FloraHolland, the Dutch company behind the world's biggest flower auction.
ransport situation became so difficult that some growers even resorted to destroying parts of their harvest. 
""Only this year, more than three hundred containers with ten tons of flowers each have been exported from Kenya by sea"", Mr Van der Hulst says. ""That's a substantial saving of thirty full cargo aircrafts.""
In addition to being cheaper, using sea freight can cut carbon emissions by between 84% and 95% respectively, according to a study funded by the UK government in 2021.
Although, clearly if you are worried about the carbon footprint of cut flowers, then it's probably best to buy a seasonal bouquet grown closer to home.
More technology of business:
Walking through his green house in Naivasha, Robin Letcher from Royal De Ruiter East Africa, explains to BBC News that rose breeders are also trying to develop new varieties.
Pointing at some red roses he says: ""This variety, for example, has firmer petals that are less sensitive to botrytis [fungus], which is good for sea freight.""
In the future, this could potentially reduce the need for chemicals during post-harvest treatments, although it could take seven to ten years to develop successfully so, ""is something for the longer term"", he adds.
Many flower producers remain nervous about switching over to sea freight.
""A stupid mistake, a port strike or bad weather at sea can really get you in trouble with sea freight,"" Mr Letcher explains.
Last year, for example, a container accidentally went to Singapore. ""It [eventually] arrived in the Netherlands after 53 days. So, all the flowers had to be destroyed, which was a disaster for the producers,"" he says.
Growers also need to contend with the perception in the industry that flowers sent by sea freight have a shorter shelf life, particularly at the world's largest flower auction in the Netherlands.
Customers do not notice much of a difference, according to Ms Kimani who says the sea freight blooms are indistinguishable from air freight flowers, adding that some of their roses even travel better by sea, than by air. 
""Although air freight only takes around 12 hours, we sometimes witness enormous temperature peaks during the journey...which obviously has a negative influence on the flowers,"" she explains. ""With sea freight, however, our flowers are continuously in dormancy.""
gistics of moving these flowers is not a simple decision, as prices are constantly changing. Shipping prices have also been rising closer to air freight costs.
But in the longer term, Mr Moster forecasts sea freight will account for at least 20% of Kenyan flower exports - a sector worth  $934m per year.
""Air freight prices probably will never fall back to the level of before the Covid-19 crisis, so also from a cost perspective sea freight remains interesting,"" Mr Moster says."	/news/business-61877762

health	Climate of fear putting patients at risk, say doctors	"Whistleblowers at one of England's worst performing hospital trusts have said a climate of fear among staff is putting patients at risk. 
Former and current clinicians at University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Trust allege they were punished by management for raising safety concerns, a BBC Newsnight investigation found. 
One insider said the trust was ""a bit like the mafia"". 
rust said it took ""patient safety very seriously"".
It said it had a ""high reporting culture of incidents"" to ensure accountability and learning. 
Staff concerns included a dangerous shortage of nurses and a lack of communication leading to some haematology patients dying without receiving treatment, an investigation by BBC Newsnight and BBC West Midlands found.  
rust - which is rated ""requires improvement"" by healthcare regulator the Care Quality Commission - is one of the largest in the UK, with four hospitals serving more than two million patients a year. 
f 20 patients in the haematology department of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, which is run by the trust, led to a review in 2017 by consultant Emmanouil Nikolousis. 
Mr Nikolousis, who left the trust in 2020, told the BBC he was shocked by the failings he found and believes patients' lives could have been saved.  
A report by Mr Nikolousis criticised a lack of ""ownership"" of patients and a lack of communication among senior clinicians. In some cases this led to patients dying without having received treatment, he said. 
""Certainly there should have been different actions done,"" he said. ""They could be saved. Certainly, when you don't have an action done, then you don't really know the outcome.""
""All these diseases in haematology, they're highly complex…they require immediate management and they require ownership of the patient. And quite a lot of times they require coordination of the teams, and that certainly hasn't happened.""
Mr Nikolousis said he felt he had no option but to quit after his findings were ignored and his position was made ""untenable"". He left the NHS after 18 years. 
""They were trying, as they did with other colleagues, to completely sort of ruin your career,"" he said. 
Another clinician, who the BBC has agreed not to identify, said when they and other consultants raised safety concerns they would be ""punished quite quickly and quite harshly"".
""They will make all kinds of spurious investigations and they will try to intimidate you that way,"" the whistleblower said. 
In the past decade, the trust has referred 26 of its doctors to the General Medical Council, which can investigate a doctor's fitness to practise, a Freedom of Information Act request by an NHS safety campaigner found. In all cases the GMC took no further action. 
Eye surgeon Tristan Reuser was referred to the GMC in 2017, several months after raising concerns about a lack of nurses to support operations at the Heart of England NHS Trust, which merged with UHB in 2018. On one occasion he needed to perform emergency eye surgery, but there were no nurses to help and he resorted to using an untrained, non-clinical staff member to assist the procedure. 
He said that whistleblowers were subjected to ""victimisation and retribution using GMC referrals"". 
""I think my case particularly, I have no doubt that that was true,"" he said.
""If you criticise senior management, they'll have you.""
GMC took no further action against Mr Reuser, but issued a formal warning against the hospital's medical director David Rosser for not telling them the eye surgeon was a whistleblower. It said his conduct risked ""bringing the profession into disrepute and it must not be repeated"". Mr Rosser is now chief executive of UHB. He is due to stand down at the end of the year for another NHS role in the region. 
Mr Reuser won an employment tribunal for wrongful dismissal. 
Although the tribunal found that Mr Reuser was unfairly dismissed, the trust told the BBC that the tribunal did not support his claim that he was dismissed because of his whistleblowing and pointed to other whistleblowing doctors against whom they say no action was taken.
Mr Reuser said he remains worried that patients would suffer if senior management did not listen to criticism about safety issues. 
""Somebody has to speak up on behalf of the patients,"" he said. ""I felt a moral obligation to speak out about this, because what happens in Birmingham, what happens to Birmingham patients is just shocking."" 
In the 12 months from April 2020, there were 12 ""never events"" - serious safety incidents which should never happen if proper safety procedures are correctly implemented. That was the highest figure in the country for the period. The number fell to four in the following 12-month period. 
rust said: ""All patient safety concerns and incidents are rigorously investigated to prevent harm to our patients.""
It said there were well-established routes and support in place for staff to raise concerns, and it promoted and encouraged this.

politics	Labour vows to lift ban on onshore wind	"A Labour government would lift a planning ban on new onshore wind farms, Sir Keir Starmer has vowed.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's refusal to back onshore wind ""is about putting his party first, and the country second"", the Labour leader said. 
Mr Sunak scrapped a move by predecessor Liz Truss to relax planning rules to allow more onshore wind turbines.
But Sir Keir said not backing onshore wind was a ""national act of self-harm, choking off our economic potential"".
Onshore wind is one of the cheapest forms of new power in the UK, and Sir Kier said that removing planning barriers would ""slash energy bills"".
Labour has already pledged to double onshore wind and quadruple offshore wind in its plan for clean power by 2030.
During a visit to a wind farm in Grimsby, North Lincolnshire, on Thursday, Sir Keir said the plan would involve ""persuading some communities to get on board"".
He said he would not hesitate to ditch the planning ban on onshore wind so that ""we can create tens of thousands of good quality skilled jobs"", even if it ""means some communities adapting to a new landscape"".
Labour's proposed planning changes include removing the loophole that allows a single person's objection to stop an application, bringing planning requirements in line with other infrastructure and imposing new targets to get planning decisions on renewables down from years to just months.
re would also be a crackdown on Whitehall blocking developments, and moves to proactively identify land for renewable energy opportunities
However, a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK government has ""increased the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid by 500% since 2010 - with 40% of our power now coming from cleaner and cheaper renewable sources"". 
""A record amount of renewable energy was secured through the latest round of our flagship scheme for incentivising large-scale renewable electricity generation. 
""We continue to support more renewable projects to come online, as clean, more affordable energy brings down costs for consumers and boosts our long-term energy security.""
Mr Sunak told the House of Commons on Wednesday that the government would focus on offshore rather than onshore wind.
""It is right that we bring people with us as we transition to net zero,"" he said. ""The worst thing we can do is alienate communities if we want to actually deliver on our climate commitments."""	/news/business-63579588
business	'Rising prices are harder on my money than the pandemic was'	"Single mum Faith Angwet struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic but says the cost of living crisis has hit her even harder.
""I was starting to feel like I was getting to a good place but now the price of everything has gone up it has pushed me right back,"" she said.
Ms Angwet is one of an estimated 1.5m UK households that will struggle to pay food and energy bills in the next year.
's according to research which also predicts a UK recession in 2022.
National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has also warned that a combination of rising prices and measures announced in the Chancellor's Spring Statement - such as the decision not to scrap a planned rise in National Insurance tax - are hitting the poorest households hardest.
Ms Angwet, 36, from Southwark in south London, is a single mother-of-two who has been unemployed since having her daughter two years ago.
""In the pandemic if you couldn't afford something you could shop around or buy in bulk. But now you can't afford it everywhere. And if I am able to buy in bulk, if the kids see it they want to eat it now. So I find myself hiding things from them so I can bring it out another day like magic.""
gs have got so bad that Ms Angwet sometimes forgoes her prescription for blood pressure medication so she can afford to buy formula and nappies for her daughter.
As she is unemployed, she cannot get any other form of benefit or financial help from the government so has turned to food banks for support. 
She said her five-year-old son's free school meals were a ""huge help"" and that she was grateful for nappies and clothes from Little Village baby bank.
""It's got to the point that I turned to a payday loan, but they want you to borrow more than you need. We can't always go to the food bank, it's a vicious cycle,"" she said.
Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 30-year high, as the Ukraine war drives up fuel and energy prices.
Bank of England has warned inflation might reach 10% within months.
k tank urged the government to raise Universal Credit by £25 per week between May and October, which would cost around £1.35bn, and give £250 each to 11.3 million lower income households.
""Without this targeted support we expect a further increase in extreme poverty,"" the think tank said, with about a quarter of a million households sliding into extreme poverty, taking the number to about a million.
About half a million households would ""face the choice between eating and heating"" without these payments, it said, adding that the chancellor had a reported £20bn of ""headroom"" for government spending that could be used to cushion the shock to income.
k tank predicted that inflation would average 7.8% in 2022 and will remain above 3% until 2024 - above the Bank of England's 2% target.
At the same time, economic growth is set to slow.
While NIESR forecast that UK economic growth in 2022 would increase by 3.5% on average, it predicted a fall in the final two quarters of the year.
would push the UK into a recession, which is two consecutive quarters of economic decline.
Meanwhile, government policies are set to leave households with even less disposable income, according to NIESR.
It forecasts household income when adjusted for inflation will fall by 2.4% in 2022, along with a small rise in unemployment next year.
Danker, director general of the CBI, which represents big businesses, told the BBC's Today programme that companies were suffering too. 
He said inflation, higher energy prices, labour shortages and the war in Ukraine had made firms ""pause before investing"", and that this was stopping them ""creating jobs and paying good wages"". 
He said the government needed to create ""reasons to invest"" such as subsidising the shift to clean energy or cutting business rates for shops. 
""If we wait... the economy will end up in more trouble,"" he added. ""Get firms investing now because that will stop us facing dire consequences later on.""
Professor Stephen Millard, NIESR's deputy director for macroeconomics, said: ""Although the war in Ukraine is fundamentally a human tragedy, it has resulted in another supply shock for the UK economy: pushing down growth and pushing up on inflation.""
He added: ""We need fiscal policy to loosen and monetary policy to tighten if the UK economy is going to sail safely through these treacherous seas.""
A Treasury spokesperson said the country has had a ""strong economic recovery"" from the pandemic but acknowledged that these are ""anxious times"", and said the government is taking action to support households.
""This includes a tax cut of over £330 a year for the typical employee, lowering the Universal Credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn, and providing millions of households with up to £350 each to help with rising energy bills,"" the spokesperson said.
""Public debt is at the highest levels since the 1960s and rising inflation is pushing up our debt interest costs, which means we must manage public finances sustainably to avoid saddling future generations with further debt.""
Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government should bring in an emergency budget ""urgently"", adding: ""With a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits we can cut household bills by up to £600 and support businesses through the cost of living storm.""
It comes as NIESR separately forecast that global economic growth would be 1% lower, or about $1.5tn, at the end of 2022, due to the Ukraine war.

business	Juul: US bans all products from leading vaping company	"US is banning the sale of all products sold by Juul, one of the country's top e-cigarette companies.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it did not have enough data to be sure that marketing the firm's products was ""appropriate for the protection of public health"".
Juul said it would challenge the move.
It comes after other recent anti-smoking efforts by the FDA, including plans to reduce the amount of addictive nicotine allowed in cigarettes. 
gency had already barred the fruity flavours that helped make Juul a phenomenon among teenagers a few years ago.
""Today's action is further progress on the FDA's commitment to ensuring that all e-cigarette and electronic nicotine delivery system products currently being marketed to consumers meet our public health standards,"" FDA commissioner Robert M. Califf said in a statement.
Juul, founded in California in 2015 by a pair of former smokers, has promoted its vaping pods as a healthier alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes.
But the products, which contain high concentrations of nicotine, raised alarm as use among teens exploded, with more than quarter of high schoolers using e-cigarettes in 2019, according to a federal survey.
In 2020 the FDA said it would require companies to submit their e-cigarette products for approval. It has since granted some of them a green light.
In its statement, the FDA said it had not received any information to suggest an ""immediate hazard"".
But it also noted the major role Juul, whose products under review had nicotine levels of 3% and 5%, still plays in the market.
""We recognise these make up a significant part of the available products and many have played a disproportionate role in the rise in youth vaping,"" Mr Califf said.
Juul said it would seek a stay of the ruling, which would allow it to keep selling as it explores options including an appeal.
""We respectfully disagree with the FDA's findings and decision and continue to believe we have provided sufficient information and data based on high-quality research to address all issues raised by the agency,"" the firm's chief regulatory officer, Joe Murillo, said in a statement.
""We intend to seek a stay and are exploring all of our options under the FDA's regulations and the law, including appealing the decision and engaging with our regulator.
""We remain committed to doing all in our power to continue serving the millions of American adult smokers who have successfully used our products to transition away from combustible cigarettes, which remain available on market shelves nationwide,"" he added.
Juul has already seen its business hit by regulatory action, as officials investigated its marketing practices to teens and tightened rules on what flavours could be sold. International restrictions have also limited its expansion outside the US.
Altria Group, which took a 35% stake in the company in 2018 for more than $12bn, has been forced to write off much of the value of its investment.

health	Base editing: Revolutionary therapy clears girl's incurable cancer	"A teenage girl's incurable cancer has been cleared from her body in the first use of a revolutionary new type of medicine. 
All other treatments for Alyssa's leukaemia had failed.  
So doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital used ""base editing"" to perform a feat of biological engineering to build her a new living drug.
Six months later the cancer is undetectable, but Alyssa is still being monitored in case it comes back. 
Alyssa, who is 13 and from Leicester, was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in May last year. 
-cells are supposed to be the body's guardians - seeking out and destroying threats - but for Alyssa they had become the danger and were growing out of control. 
Her cancer was aggressive. Chemotherapy, and then a bone-marrow transplant, were unable to rid it from her body. 
Without the experimental medicine, the only option left would have been merely to make Alyssa as comfortable as possible. 
""Eventually I would have passed away,"" said Alyssa. Her mum, Kiona, said this time last year she had been dreading Christmas, ""thinking this is our last with her"". And then she ""just cried"" through her daughter's 13th birthday in January. 
What happened next would have been unthinkable just a few years ago and has been made possible by incredible advances in genetics. 
m at Great Ormond Street used a technology called base editing, which was invented only six years ago. 
Bases are the language of life. The four types of base - adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) - are the building blocks of our genetic code. Just as letters in the alphabet spell out words that carry meaning, the billions of bases in our DNA spell out the instruction manual for our body. 
Base editing allows scientists to zoom to a precise part of the genetic code and then alter the molecular structure of just one base, converting it into another and changing the genetic instructions. 
rge team of doctors and scientists used this tool to engineer a new type of T-cell that was capable of hunting down and killing Alyssa's cancerous T-cells. 
rted with healthy T-cells that came from a donor and set about modifying them.
final stage of genetic modification instructed the T-cells to go hunting for anything with the CD7 marking on it so that it would destroy every T-cell in her body - including the cancerous ones. That's why this marking has to be removed from the therapy - otherwise it would just destroy itself.  
If the therapy works, Alyssa's immune system - including T-cells - will be rebuilt with the second bone-marrow transplant.
When the idea was explained to the family, mum Kiona was left thinking: ""You can do that?"" It was Alyssa's decision to be the first to take the experimental therapy - which contained millions of the modified cells - in May this year.
""She's the first patient to be treated with this technology,"" said Prof Waseem Qasim, from UCL and Great Ormond Street. 
He said this genetic manipulation was a ""very fast-moving area of science"" with ""enormous potential"" across a range of diseases. 
Alyssa was left vulnerable to infection, as the designer cells attacked both the cancerous T-cells in her body and those that protect her from disease. 
After a month, Alyssa was in remission and was given a second bone-marrow transplant to regrow her immune system. 
Alyssa spent 16 weeks in hospital and couldn't see her brother, who was still going to school, in case he brought germs in. 
re were worries after the three-month check-up found signs of the cancer again. But her two most recent investigations have been clear. 
""You just learn to appreciate every little thing. I'm just so grateful that I'm here now,"" said Alyssa. 
""It's crazy. It's just amazing I've been able to have this opportunity, I'm very thankful for it and it's going to help other children, as well, in the future.""
She's eyeing-up Christmas, being a bridesmaid at her auntie's wedding, getting back on her bike, going back to school and ""just doing normal people stuff"".
family hope the cancer will never return, but are already grateful for the time it has bought them. 
""To have this extra year, this last three months when she's been home, has been a gift in itself,"" said Kiona.
Dad James said: ""I find it quite hard to talk about how proud we are. When you see what she's gone through and her vitality of life she's brought to every situation, it's outstanding.""
Most children with a leukaemia respond to the main treatments, but it is thought that up to a dozen a year could benefit from this therapy.
Alyssa is just the first of 10 people to be given the drug as part of a clinical trial. 
Dr Robert Chiesa, from the bone-marrow transplant department at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: ""It is extremely exciting. Obviously, this is a new field in medicine and it's fascinating that we can redirect the immune system to fight cancer.""
gy, though, only scratches the surface of what base editing could achieve.
Dr David Liu, one of the inventors of base editing at the Broad Institute, told me it was ""a bit surreal"" that people were being treated just six years after the technology was invented. 
In Alyssa's therapy, each of the base edits involved breaking a section of genetic code so it no longer worked. But there are more nuanced applications where instead of switching an instruction off you can fix a defective one. Sickle-cell anaemia, for example, is caused by just one base change that could be corrected.
So there are already trials of base editing under way in sickle-cell disease, as well as high cholesterol that runs in families and the blood disorder beta-thalassemia.
Dr Liu said the ""therapeutic applications of base editing are just beginning"" and it was ""humbling to be part of this era of therapeutic human gene editing"", as science was now taking ""key steps towards taking control of our genomes"".

business	Sports Direct owner Frasers Group scraps home working	"Office staff at Mike Ashley's Frasers Group will no longer work from home on Fridays after a memo said some were ""not treating Friday as a working day"".
memo from the retail group's chief operating officer, David Al-Mudallal, seen by The Sun, said there were ""too many examples"" of people not being contactable when they needed to be.
So-called ""Frasers Fridays"" was started as a flexible working policy in 2020.
A spokeswoman said the firm believed people worked better in an office.
keswoman told the BBC ""collaboration"" was ""key to how we deliver value"".
""We believe that we are all at our best when we work together in an office environment,"" she added.
Mr Al-Mudallal was reported to have told staff that some of their social media profiles were ""demonstrating that they're not treating Friday as a working day"".
He added that Fridays had become an ""unproductive day of the week"".
Frasers Group, which includes brands such as House of Fraser and Evans Cycles, is owned by Sports Direct founder and retail billionaire Mike Ashley.
Mr Ashley handed over the day-to-day running of his retail empire to his future son-in law, Michael Murray, in May.
It is understood bosses at Frasers Group had been measuring the productivity of staff on Fridays since the start of the flexible working scheme and decided to pull people back into the office.
Flexible and hybrid working patterns - where some people get to work some days at home and others in offices - have become more common since coronavirus pandemic restrictions were lifted.
However, companies differ in their opinion of new working practices. In April this year, Airbnb decided to let its employees work from anywhere for as long as they like, but last year the boss of Goldman Sachs rejected remote working as a ""new normal"" and labelled it an ""aberration"" instead.
Working from home for part of the week has become the norm for some employees, a survey of managers has suggested.
Chartered Institute of Management found in February that more than 80% of firms had adopted hybrid working - most since the pandemic.
ute said firms should embrace hybrid work as ""best practice"".
In April, Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said hybrid working let firms widen the net when recruiting to try to tackle skills shortages, and it can improve productivity and work/life balance.
However, he added that there were also potential downsides to hybrid working, including the possibility of ""a two-tier workforce"", with a split between those who have lots of flexibility and those who cannot work from home.
UK government said in September 2021 that would like to give workers the right to request flexible working when they start new jobs from day one, and is reviewing more than 1,600 responses to a consultation that closed in December last year."	/news/business-62175875
business	UK house prices forecast to fall for the next two years	"UK house prices will fall for the next two years before starting to rise again, according to the government's official forecaster.
A drop of 9% is expected between now and autumn 2024, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has said.
will be a relief to some potential first-time buyers following a period of sharp rises in property prices.
But a squeeze on their own finances will limit their ability to save for a deposit.
f a mortgage is also likely to stay much higher than homeowners have become accustomed to during the last decade. A typical two- or five-year fixed-rate deal currently has an interest rate of just over 6%.
Higher mortgage rates and the wider impact of a slowdown in the economy, such as rising unemployment, will unite to push down house prices, the OBR said.
It forecast that there will still be an average increase in property prices this year of 10.7% despite the recent slowdown.
will be followed by two years of falls, with house prices down by 1.2% next year, and 5.7% in 2024.
OBR suggests that property prices will start to rise again at a rate slightly faster than people's incomes - up by 1.2% in 2025, 3% in 2026 and 3.5% in 2027.
However, it pointed out there was ""significant uncertainty over this forecast"" given the sensitivity of house prices to mortgage rates and general borrowing costs.
UK housing market, in reality, is a series of local markets, so house price falls could have more impact in some areas than others. 
For example, despite the rebound after the 2008 financial crisis, house prices in the north-east of England only returned to their pre-crash levels at the end of 2020. Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland, house prices still remain below their pre-crisis peak.
Squeezed incomes mean that first-time buyers may still be asking for the help of parents and grandparents to get enough for a deposit, even if house prices fall.
Richard Fearon, chief executive of Leeds Building Society, said: ""Our research shows that 81% of aspiring first-time buyers say that the cost of living crisis has made it harder for them to save for a deposit and almost half of them now doubt they will ever get onto the housing ladder.""
He said a lack of homes was still the key long-term issue in the market.
A new deadline will see a reversal of the cuts in stamp duty at the end of March 2025. This may also affect potential buyers' long-term plans in London and the south-east of England, where the vast majority of stamp duty is paid.
Other measures announced in the Autumn Statement could have a notable impact for other parts of the housing sector.
renting social housing in England will still face higher rental bills - but not as high as might have been the case.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government would cap the increase in social rents in England at a maximum of 7% in 2023-24, rather than the 11% potential rise under previous rules. This cap does not apply to shared ownership rents or private sector rents.
Meanwhile, buy-to-let landlords - who may include so-called accidental landlords who find themselves with two homes after moving in together - face a higher capital gains tax bill if they sell up.
ual allowance before capital gains tax is paid will be reduced from £12,300 to £6,000 in April and then to £3,000 a year later. The tax is paid when you sell an asset, such as company shares, a second home, or a buy-to-let property."	/news/business-63676119

business	Mortgage rates rise sharply as squeeze tightens	"Major mortgage lenders are increasing the cost of home loans, with the average two-year fixed rate now close to 6%, new figures show.
A typical two-year fixed mortgage deal is currently 5.75%, up from 4.74% on the day of the mini-budget, financial information service Moneyfacts said.
Lenders have been scrambling to reprice deals after the pound's fall fuelled forecasts of higher interest rates.
Mortgage rates have climbed since December as interest rates have risen.
In December, the average two-year fixed deal was 2.34%.
Fixed deal interest rates do not change during the term of the mortgage, so rates are quoted for new or renewing borrowers.
Lenders have also withdrawn hundreds of products in recent days, which may leave some borrowers with difficulties securing a deal. 
recently re-priced deals have tended to be from major lenders who want relatively low-risk borrowers. Those homeowners who have high debt levels, or who may have missed repayments on credit, may find their choice is much more limited in the short-term.
Brokers say there is still money available for mortgage providers to lend, but the days of ultra-low rates - typical of the last decade - have quickly disappeared.
""We did not expect that to happen quite so rapidly,"" one broker said.
Mortgage rates have been rising ever since the Bank of England began a series of seven consecutive rises in the Bank rate - the benchmark figure of interest rates. Rates then jumped after the mini-budget prompted widespread expectation of a faster and higher jump in the Bank rate in the coming months.
Lenders look at the long-term cost of borrowing, and potential demand, and try to stay a step ahead of the Bank of England when setting the rates for fixed rate deals.
Roughly 100,000 people a month come to the end of a fixed deal and often remortgage, while first-time buyers also sign up to fixed deals. The 1.5 million homeowners on variable or tracker deals often see their costs rise in direct response to a Bank rate rise.
A typical five-year fixed deal has been slightly cheaper than a two-year fixed deal for some time - but both are now seeing rates rise sharply.
""The normal rules of lending have changed,"" said Aaron Strutt of Trinity Financial.
Halifax - the UK's biggest mortgage lender - said it would launch its new, higher rates on Wednesday. 
""The new rates reflect the continued increase in mortgage market pricing over recent weeks,"" a spokesperson for Halifax said.
In recent days, other major lenders such as NatWest, Nationwide and Virgin Money have increased their rates.
NatWest did so on Sunday, a highly unusual day of the week to make a change, according to brokers, signalling the speed at which the market is changing.
A homeowner borrowing £200,000 on a 30-year mortgage may have been looking at a rate of 3.5% and a monthly repayment of £898 just over a week ago. Now, there are more likely to be facing a 5.5% rate and a monthly repayment of £1,135.
As always, there is uncertainty over the longer-term trend for mortgage rates. People will have to consider how much they can borrow, and what lenders will judge them to be able to afford.
Amid the turmoil of last week, lenders pulled deals off the shelf at unprecedented levels, with brokers saying deals were lasting for a very short period of time as people flooded them and lenders with enquiries.
Moneyfacts said that there were 3,961 deals available on the morning of the mini-budget, compared with 2,262 at the start of this week - a 43% fall. Products were last withdrawn quickly at the start of the pandemic, but not at such a level.
Many of deals were withdrawn by smaller, more specialist lenders. That may create added uncertainty for those with more chequered borrowing histories.

technology	TikTok Now: BeReal-style feature prompts copycat claims	"kTok users have noticed a new feature promising ""a whole new creative experience"" - but they've been quick to question how new it really is.
, called TikTok Now, released in the UK this week, asks users to take a photo or video from their phone's front and back cameras at a random time of day.
kTok has encouraged people to ""share their most authentic moments"".
But many have pointed out that it looks pretty similar to BeReal.
, seen as an alternative to the filtered and curated feeds often associated with social media, has grown rapidly since it was launched by a small French company.
It's currently ninth in Apple's overall UK App Store downloads chart, compared with TikTok's 14th place.
But it has got some catching up to do, with some reports putting its total downloads at about 27 million against TikTok's estimated three billion.
re are some subtle differences between TikTok's offering and BeReal's.
Both will send users a notification at a random time of day, after which they'll have a limited time to snap a photo. TikTok Now also allows for 10-second videos.
BeReal prompts you with the message ""It's time to BeReal"", whereas TikTok has settled on ""It's Time to Now"" for its daily countdown launch.
As for sharing your posts, BeReal is restricted by design - photos are only meant to be seen by a small circle of close friends, in line with the app's low-key attitude.
kTok Now offers users the ability to share their posts with the wider world, although it will be limited to friends by default.
And younger users will have automatic restrictions placed on their posts.
Following TikTok's announcement earlier this year, people were quick to point out that the concept behind TikTok Now looked very familiar.
Others were more direct, accusing it of ""blatantly copying"" its smaller competitor.
xperts leapt on the fact that Instagram had been beaten to the launch, after the company confirmed last month that it was testing Candid Challenges, its own BeReal-style feature.
And industry analyst Matt Navarra said the announcement by ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, was ""shameless and ferociously fast"".
Could my BeReal get me sacked?
Instagram U-turns on TikTok-style revamp
kTok reveals 2022 summer breakout artist
Social media companies have a track record of ""borrowing"" ideas from each other - with varying degrees of success.
Some features we take for granted - Twitter's ""Like"" button, Instagram's Stories and the trend for short, vertical videos - have either inspired imitators or been copied from elsewhere.
For example, Instagram recently rolled back an unpopular TikTok-style revamp that filled people's feeds with videos.
Even celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner weighed in, accusing the app of trying to imitate its rival and urging it to ""make Instagram Instagram again"".
And you might remember Fleets - Twitter's ill-fated attempt to introduce disappearing tweets similar to Instagram's Stories features.
Or you might not. After a backlash, the company quietly retired the feature after just a few months, saying it hadn't ""seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped"".
As for TikTok Now, users in the USA got it first, with the button for the feature replacing the current Friends tab. There are plans to release it as a separate app in some countries.
It remains to be seen whether it will stick around long-term or vanish more quickly than a Vine video.

business	Russian gas firm Gazprom to cut some supply to Shell	"Shell has said it will work to keep gas flowing to its customers in Europe after Russian energy firm Gazprom said it would cut supplies from tomorrow.
Gazprom said it would halt gas to Denmark's Orsted and to Shell for its contract to supply gas to Germany, after both refused to make payments in roubles, Reuters reported.
Shell told the BBC it would continue to get gas from its other sources.
gas giant said it would continue to phase out Russian fossil fuels.
move by Gazprom comes after European Union leaders said they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine.
In response to Western sanctions, Russia has already cut off gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, Finland and the Netherlands, after the countries refused to comply with Russian demands to switch to payment in roubles.
move expands that retaliation to Germany and Denmark.
Vladimir Putin's decree has been seen as an attempt to boost the Russian currency, which has been hit by sanctions, as more foreign exchange demand for roubles is likely to increase demand and push up its value.
Shell told the BBC it had not agreed to ""new payment terms set out by Gazprom"", which included the creation of Russian bank accounts.
""We will work to continue supplying our customers in Europe through our diverse portfolio of gas supply,"" a spokesman said.
""Shell continues to work on a phased withdrawal from Russian hydrocarbons, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.""
Meanwhile, Orsted said on Monday that Gazprom stopping gas flows would put Denmark's supplies at risk.
Shell has taken a hit of $5bn (£3.8bn) from offloading its Russian assets as part of its plans to withdraw sever ties with the country. It also confirmed it had quit its joint ventures with Gazprom.
firm pledged in April to no longer buy oil from Russia, but said contracts signed before the invasion of Ukraine would be fulfilled.
Shell was criticised when it bought Russian crude oil at a cheap price shortly after the war began.
war in Ukraine has pushed countries in the West to phase out Russian energy supplies.
Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, which is also the bloc's main oil supplier, but some countries are more dependent Russian fossil fuels than others, so sudden supply cuts could have huge economic impact.
Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, said it was ""clear"" that European countries and companies was want to reduce imports of Russian fossil fuels.
However he warned of the ""ongoing risk that efforts to reduce Russian oil and gas imports results in higher oil and gas prices"", limiting the impact on Russia.
""Russian volumes may gradually be reduced but they are 'compensated' by higher overall prices,"" he added. 
He said the geopolitical tensions were set against ""an already tight oil and gas market prior to the invasion of Ukraine"".
Countries have been filling gas storage sites ahead of winter due to the threats of Russian supply cuts.
So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen.
Meanwhile the EU leaders have agreed an immediate ban on Russian oil being transported into the bloc by sea.
In late March, Russia said ""unfriendly countries"" would have to start paying for its oil and gas in roubles after Western allies froze billions of dollars it held in foreign currencies overseas.
Under the decree, European importers must pay euros or dollars into an account at Gazprombank, the Swiss-based trading arm of Gazprom, and then convert this into roubles in a second account in Russia.
majority - 97% - of EU companies' gas supply contracts with Gazprom stipulate payment in euros or dollars."	/news/business-61652931
politics	When will Northern Ireland next go to the polls?	"Voters in Northern Ireland have avoided a return to the polls before Christmas.
But if the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) continues to refuse to reform an executive, the Northern Ireland secretary will remain under a duty to call another assembly election next year.
Legislation setting new deadlines is now in force, but it is possible those dates could end up drifting.
xt local government elections could also be rescheduled due to a clash with King Charles III's coronation in May.
Council elections in Northern Ireland take place every four years and the next one is currently scheduled for Thursday, 4 May 2023.
However, the decision to hold King Charles III's coronation ceremony two days later has put a spanner in the works.
Unlike in Great Britain where council elections are also happening, results in Northern Ireland will not be counted overnight.
Counting is not due to begin until the Friday morning.
During the last council elections in 2019, counting continued well into Saturday evening.
rocess can take many hours as results are determined using the proportional representation system of Single Transferable Vote (STV). 
DUP and the Alliance Party's deputy leader, Stephen Farry, have asked if government will change the date of the election to ensure it does not clash with the coronation events, which a number of local politicians would be expected to attend.
Yes, the law allows for this to happen.
It was even referenced by Northern Ireland Minister Lord Caine on Monday when asked by peers if the government intended to do so.
He pointed to Section 84 of the Northern Ireland Act, the legislation underpinning Stormont's institutions after the Good Friday Agreement peace deal was reached in 1998.
wer allows Mr Heaton-Harris to change the date of a council election.
Lord Caine did not commit outright to maintaining the current 4 May date.
Instead, he told peers that the timing of local government elections would be considered in due course, and that there was a ""short window"" to reach a decision.
It is not clear how short or long that window is but it is understood the Electoral Office would need clarity in early 2023, before it begins notifying schools and other centres of the requirements around polling day.
On Thursday, the Northern Ireland secretary also confirmed the government is ""taking soundings"" on whether to change the date of next year's council election. He said that decision would be made after he had spoken to all the political parties at Stormont about it. 
After Mr Heaton-Harris decided not to call a Stormont election before Christmas, he introduced legislation to delay the deadline for reforming a power-sharing government.
It put in place two new dates: initially 8 December, with the option of a six-week extension until 19 January.
In the event that talks between the UK and EU have not made progress on the Northern Ireland Protocol - the reason the DUP has protested and blocked Stormont from functioning - the secretary of state could then face another big decision.
Would he at that point follow through on his legal duty to call a fresh election within 12 weeks, at the latest taking place on 13 April?
ms an unlikely prospect, given it would fall just three days after the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.
Events marking the anniversary are already being planned and there is speculation of a visit to Northern Ireland by US President Joe Biden.
government could then opt to introduce legislation to push back further the deadline for restoring the executive, although this is an option it said it was not considering for now.
If the executive is not restored and an assembly election is not further delayed, the government could choose to hold it and the local government elections on the same day.
In 2014, council and European Parliament elections were held on the same day although counting of the results took place on separate days.
Carrying out similar plans next year would be less than ideal for electoral staff if they had to manage two counts concurrently.
rospect of 850 council candidates and more than 200 assembly runners canvassing at the same time could also prove challenging.
Difficulties aside, we can rule very little out and it will be up to the government to decide the dates.
For now, watch this space.

entertainment	Black Panther Suffolk exhibition creator wins museum award	"A woman has been recognised for her work on a museum exhibition that features three costumes from the Marvel movie Black Panther.
Elma Glasgow, the founder of Aspire Black Suffolk, won the Museums Association Radical Changemaker award.
It was for her work connecting communities with museums across Suffolk with the Power of Stories exhibition.
She said she was left ""humbled"" by the accolade.
When the exhibition was on show at Christchurch Mansion in Ipswich from June to September 2021, it won temporary exhibition of the year at the Museum and Heritage Awards and attracted more than 24,000 visitors from June to September.
It includes outfits worn by three characters in the film: T'Challa, the Black Panther and king of fictional African country Wakanda, played by the late Chadwick Boseman, his scientific genius sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) and Okoye, Wakanda's military leader (Danai Gurira).
Wakanda Forever, the sequel to Black Panther has been released at cinemas.
judges said: ""Elma's drive to celebrate black heritage in Suffolk has created opportunities for thousands of people to connect, understand, and explore previously excluded histories.""
Ms Glasgow said: ""I'm so humbled but thrilled to win the award.
""Never, in my wildest dreams, did I think I'd be earning a living from work I've been passionate about since my teens: anti-racism and equality. 
""I sincerely hope this national recognition will help Aspire Black Suffolk grow its positive social impact by working with more organisations in the arts, culture, heritage, schools, universities and with clients in other sectors. ""
Power of Stories can be seen at Snape Maltings until 19 February, 2023 and was previously on display at Moyse's Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds and The Food Museum, Stowmarket.

business	Lowestoft: 'If empty shops open up everybody wins'	"In the Queen's Speech the government announced that councils would get new planning powers to force landlords in England to let out empty shops to rejuvenate high streets. What do people in the Suffolk coastal town of Lowestoft, the UK's most easterly point, make of the plans?
Home to more than 70,000 people the coastal town of Lowestoft is the most easterly settlement in the UK.
who live there say the town has been caught in a vicious economic circle in recent years.
As shop after shop has closed, the fewer visitors come and the cycle continues.
Mandy Peterson, has run Lennie's, a plant shop in the town for four years. 
""I took voluntary redundancy and I thought I would use that money to set myself up in a business that I thought I would enjoy doing.
""Lowestoft has taken a real dip in how much retail there is here, it doesn't look so nice to walk through when everywhere is closed. 
She says local shop keepers do work together and ""help each other"". 
Her message to anyone thinking of opening a new business - ""give it a go.""
She does not think forcing landlords to let out empty shop units will work in all situations. 
""I'm not sure if we should force anybody to do anything personally, the thought of empty shops being open, marvellous, everybody wins. The landlord wins for the rent, the community wins for the financial  flow and it's a better area for everyone to live in.""
She remembers a time when in the '80s and '90s there were ""nice shops"" with ""loads of choice"" in Lowestoft. 
""I was born here, so I've seen a big change. It's awful if you're a local person and you've seen the town that you've lived in all your life go down.""
She believes things could turn around if there is the ""will and the finance"" in place. 
Pamela Norman says Lowestoft has ""gone downhill very badly, there's nothing"", so she does not come into town a lot. 
""It needs to be more people friendly, there's just nothing here""
re are only ""a couple of shops, there's not a lot""
""Awful"" is what Nicki Cross thinks of the seaside town. 
She also believes it has gone ""downhill so much, I've lived here all my life and there's nothing here"". 
""Regeneration"" is the answer, she said.
""The shops are closing left, right and centre, we're just getting no new trade, the road network system is absolutely awful.  
""Something seriously needs to be done as the town is dying a death.""
Danny Steel, a commercial property specialist and chairman of the business improvement group, Lowestoft Vision, believes the government's scheme to make sure empty shops are taken over, will have some positives.  
""In some cases yes it will and in other cases it could cause problems, the devil is in the detail,"" he said.
Mr Steel does not think just having retail shops is the answer as the nature of town centres is changing. 
He would like to see coffee bars, restaurants, nail bars, doctors' surgeries and dentists, alongside shops and homes. 
Plans are in place to turn units in the town into housing and ""we want that, we need a thriving,  breathing, living town centre"", he said.
""Wouldn't it be great if in the evenings there were children playing out in the pedestrian precinct... it would be a proper community.""
He does not think Lowestoft is any different to most towns, as he think Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic and internet shopping has all added to changes. 
""Last year something like 30 percent of all sales were internet based so the whole retail offering from town centres is reducing very very quickly.
""It would be great to see the town centres busy again and bustling, but bustling maybe for different things rather than retail.""

politics	Rishi Sunak admits not enough asylum claims are being processed	"Keir Starmer says PM did 'grubby deal' to avoid an election
Rishi Sunak has admitted not enough asylum claims are being processed, but promised to fix the system.
He was responding to questions from Sir Keir Starmer who accused the government of having lost control.
Labour leader also called for Suella Braverman to be replaced with a ""proper home secretary"". 
Last week MPs were told that just 4% of those coming to the UK via small boat Channel crossings in 2021 had received decisions on their asylum claims.
government is also facing questions about severe overcrowding at the Manston asylum processing centre in Kent, which has reportedly led to outbreaks of disease and violence. 
re have been reports of over 4,000 people staying at the centre, despite it being meant to hold just 1,600 when it was built.
Migrants are supposed to be kept at the centre for 24 hours only but the chief inspector of immigration has said some people had been there for over a month. 
On Monday, Ms Braverman said illegal migration was ""out of control"" and acknowledged the system was ""broken"".
Repeating her comment at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir asked Mr Sunak ""who broke it?""
""If the asylum system is broken and his lot have been in power for 12 years - how can it be anyone's fault but theirs.""
rime minister defended his government's record, pointing to an increase of staff at Manston and the number of hotel beds available for arrivals. 
""These are significant steps that demonstrate we are getting a grip of this system,"" he told Sir Keir.
He accused Labour of not having a plan to fix the problem, describing their policy as ""a blank page"". 
Sir Keir said the government had wasted £140m on the Rwanda scheme which has so far failed to deport any failed asylum seekers. 
He urged the government to ""scrap the Rwanda gimmick, crack down on smuggling gangs, end the small boat crossings, speed up asylum claims and agree an international deal on refugees? 
""Start governing for once and get a grip.""
was a difficult PMQs for the new prime minister for two reasons.
Firstly, he is Conservative prime minister number five after 12 years of Conservative government, and so there is nowhere to hide and no-one else to blame when things go wrong.
And secondly, because of the bluntness of his home secretary.
Suella Braverman said the other day that illegal immigration was ""out of control"".
And Sunak was forced to admit the speed of processing asylum claims isn't good enough.
rime minister is, for now, managing to keep his side on side - with tribal stuff that Conservative MPs lap up about Keir Starmer having wanted Jeremy Corbyn to become prime minister.
But you have to wonder about the shelf life of those attack lines as the problems for the government stack up.
Earlier this year, the government announced plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda where they could claim refuge. 
Ministers argue this would reduce the numbers crossing the English Channel, but the policy has been held up by legal challenges.
Almost 40,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far in 2022 - the highest number since figures began to be collected in 2018. 
rocessing asylum claims is partly down to a rule change from 2019, whereby the Home Office scrapped a target for decision-making.
Council leaders in Kent have warned the home secretary the county is at ""breaking point"" dealing with the migrant issue, with public services coming under ""extreme pressure"".
Earlier this week, Ms Braverman described the numbers arriving in the UK as an ""invasion on the south coast"".
United Nations Human Rights Commissioner has now criticised the home secretary, saying invasion was ""a horrible word"".  
Speaking in Geneva, Volker Türk said politicians had to be sure their words didn't ""add fuel to the fire on issues that are about human beings"".
Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has also expressed anger at the rhetoric used in the UK, after figures showed a big rise in the number of Albanians coming to the UK in small boats. 
""Targeting Albanians (as some shamefully did when fighting for Brexit) as the cause of Britain's crime and border problems makes for easy rhetoric but ignores hard fact,"" he tweeted.
""Albanians in the UK work hard and pay tax... [the] UK should fight the crime gangs of all nationalities and stop discriminating [against] Albanians to excuse policy failures."""	/news/uk-politics-63486665

ravelling to the capital will also have to do tests for the first three days of their visit, and stay inside until they are given the all-clear.
Millions of other people across the vast country are also under Covid lockdowns, as cases continue to soar despite the efforts of authorities. On Sunday, 24,730  new cases were recorded, nearing the country's daily infection peak in April.
Beijing  reported 316 new Covid cases to 15:00 on Monday, according to Reuters news agency. Among the three deaths reported since Sunday afternoon was an 87-year-old man.
Liu Xiaofeng - the deputy director of Beijing's municipal Centre for Disease Control and Prevention - described the situation as the most complex and severe yet seen in the city, the news agency added.
A day earlier, a municipality spokesman warned Beijing was facing ""a grim and complicated epidemic prevention and control situation"", according to China Daily.
While China says its strict zero-Covid policy means that it has seen far fewer coronavirus deaths than much of the rest of the world - although it is thought the true figure could be far higher - there have been repeated stories of delayed emergency treatment for seriously ill people in locked-down areas or quarantine facilities.
In recent days there has been a swell of outrage online, following reports a baby had died because her medical care had been delayed by Covid restrictions. 
Earlier this month there were angry demonstrations in the western city of Lanzhou after a father said delays in getting his toddler son to hospital had contributed to his death from carbon monoxide poisoning. Then in October, there were reports of a a 14-year-old girl dying in Henan Province after falling ill in a Covid quarantine centre.   
Elsewhere, Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, has tested positive for Covid, the day after he met Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit in Thailand.

business	What can be done to tackle the energy crisis?	"A sense of scale is important when considering the size of the energy crisis now facing every household in the country - and what the government will have to do about it.
Average energy bills of nearly £300 per month are unthinkable and unmanageable for several million households. 
Friday's energy price cap announcement from Ofgem puts them at this level from October onwards. 
But some predictions have that number at £550 per month by April - closer to the average cost of a mortgage - as wholesale gas prices have surged yet higher in recent days.
For an average household on £31,000 income per year, energy costs are set to exceed income tax bills. Or alternatively, the energy rise we will have seen since last year, is the equivalent of adding 15p to 20p to the basic rate of tax.
It will drain the disposable income of several million households. 
And it is not just an issue which will transform the path of the economy. These rises are so large and so widespread that they could test the nation's social resilience too.
Even the energy industry itself doesn't think these rises are possible.  
At a recent meeting with the government to discuss the Energy Tariff Deficit Fund, a key takeaway was that not one energy firm believed that it is feasible to charge the nation what the companies themselves are having to pay to purchase gas. 
mazing and remarkable situation.
So that gaping hole, that is getting larger every day, week and month is now in the hands of the government.
Ultimately, the government must choose who needs help. It will be over half of households at least. 
Extending it to everyone will cost much more, but will also rein in the overall inflation rate, and be far simpler. There is a vein of thinking that wealthier households that accumulated savings during the pandemic should pay their own way.
It comes down to a choice between tens of billions of pounds and several tens of billions.
And so far, we are getting very little of the relevant detail from the Conservative leadership, and future Prime Minister, candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.
re is also the question of who should pay eventually. Government borrowing will go up at first. But the energy industry has suggested that customers essentially repay this back with higher bills for the next decade through the Energy Tariff Deficit Fund.
result would be to keep bills from rising much above £2,000 on average, but there would have to be acceptance that they would come down only very slowly into the 2030s, even if the war in Ukraine is over.
may not work. So those parts of the energy industry making even greater profits from exactly the same gas extraction might face a further tax grab. Or general taxes might have to increase. This would require a breaking of some of the promises in the Conservative leadership campaign even before it is over.
Extra borrowing could take the strain. 
But market interest rates are already surging and high inflation is also fast increasing the price of government borrowing. The Bank of England also faces even higher inflation and even higher government borrowing.
It is a potent mix: inflation, recession, high debts, and the core reason for it all, a wartime energy shock
And perhaps that is the point. It is not the market driving this. It is geopolitics, diplomacy and conflict. 
Margaret Thatcher's former energy secretary Lord David Howell, told the BBC this week the country needed to be on ""a war-footing"" as regards energy and that these bills were simply ""impossible"".
At the very moment that most households come to see that the ""energy price cap"" is not really a cap on the price they pay for energy, it seems likely that the government may have to encourage immediate measures to save energy.
w Prime Minister will have to make an ominous judgement even before they get the keys to Downing Street."	/news/business-62689389
entertainment	Festivals still facing pandemic strife, Hay boss says	"Festivals continue to face challenges with the Covid pandemic changing the way people choose how they plan ahead, the Hay Festival's new boss has said.
Julie Finch said cultural organisations found people now often left it to the last minute before deciding what to do.
She said that made it difficult to plan audience capacity at events like the Powys town's cultural festivals.
She has admitted having a wish-list of hoped-for guests, adding ""someone like Michelle Obama would be fantastic"".
Hay festival was founded in the Welsh border book town in 1988 and has branched out beyond bringing leading authors to presenting events including scientists, politicians, musicians and comedians.
""What's happened in Covid is that people's behaviour has changed and they're choosing what they want to do and taking more care about that,"" said the chief executive.
""We've planned on certain capacities arriving and we don't know until the day sometimes at the moment whether or not people are going to turn up.
""It is incredibly difficult for festivals to plan.
""I think what we've all got to acknowledge is that, on top of the financial situation, we're also recovering from Covid still in terms of the bounce back, and lots of institutions have development and it's going to take up three to six years in order to turn around the organisations.""
But some events at next month's Winter Festival have already sold out in advance, including a session with former Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable.
Asked about guests who could appear at future Hay festivals, Finch said there was a ""top secret"" list but added that someone liked former US First Lady Michelle Obama could be an inspiration for audiences.
""We're currently working through our wish-list and there's some really interesting people who've shaped the world, so someone like Michelle Obama would be fantastic,"" she told the BBC Radio Wales Sunday Supplement programme.
""Wouldn't it be great if she came to Hay Wales to talk to us about her story and also inspire young people?"""	/news/uk-wales-63103561
health	Abortion: Full NI service to be set up after delays	"A permanent abortion service is now being commissioned in Northern Ireland, the government has announced.
move comes three years after MPs voted to change Northern Ireland's abortion laws while devolution was suspended.
Setting up full services has been held up due to political deadlock.
Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris said health trusts will now be able to recruit and train staff to support ""sustainable services"".
On Friday he said he had instructed Stormont's Department of Health to press ahead with setting up the service.
Earlier this year, his predecessor Brandon Lewis took powers allowing the government to intervene in this way.
Since March 2020, health and social care trusts have been allowed to carry out early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, but the service has been running on an ad hoc basis.
government said the formal commissioning would allow trusts to ensure ""high quality services"" are available across Northern Ireland. 
Mr Heaton-Harris has also written to Stormont's party leaders informing them of the development.
He said his officials would continue to work with the Department of Health and the healthcare sector to ensure a range of services was in place in the coming months.
It could be early to mid-2023 before the service is fully up and running, and it will also need to be funded by Stormont's block grant.
Last week the government said funding for the current financial year would be ring-fenced within the Department of Health's budget.
Department of Health said it acknowledged the legal requirements placed on it by the secretary of state and had been working closely with the Northern Ireland Office on the planned commissioning of abortion services in Northern Ireland. 
It added: ""Today's legal instruction on commissioning and the ringfencing of funding will mean that HSC Trusts will have the necessary resources to ensure a full range of abortion services will be available in NI, including putting in place the necessary staffing and training required.""
In 2019, MPs passed legislation to decriminalise abortion.
Abortion is a devolved matter, but at that time devolution in Northern Ireland was suspended due to a political row.
gislation passed by Westminster also put the onus on the government to draw up a new framework for abortions to be carried out in Northern Ireland in a range of circumstances
ws came into force in March 2020, after the executive had been restored.
But the parties disagreed on the commissioning of a full service, with the Democratic Unionist Party using its veto to block the matter.
-Health Minister Robin Swann of the Ulster Unionist Party also said he could not commission the service himself, as the matter was controversial and cross-cutting, meaning it required approval from the entire executive. "	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63833719
politics	I'm a Celebrity: Adam Hills holds mock surgery in Hancock constituency	"Comedian Adam Hills has held a mock political surgery in the constituency of Matt Hancock, who remains on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
f Channel 4's The Last Leg gave people in Mildenhall, Suffolk, the chance to raise concerns while their MP competes in the Australian jungle.
Hancock has faced criticism for joining the show when Parliament is sitting.
""Comedians shouldn't be doing the jobs of politicians,"" tweeted Hills, who said people had ""genuine issues"".
""It was a pleasure to meet the people of Mildenhall in Suffolk today. I hope their MP does the same soon,"" he posted.
In a tweet, which has since been deleted, police in Mildenhall thanked Hills for taking the time to visit the area and listen to the concerns of local residents. 
Speaking about the fake surgery on Good Morning Britain, Hills said: ""I thought people would have comedy issues but no, people wanted better access to public transport, to dentists, to doctors, all that kind of stuff.
""People aren't angry, they just want their MP to turn up and listen to their concerns.
""A whole bunch of people said it would just be nice to get a response, we've sent emails, we've sent letters and when that response is, 'I'm sorry, I'm eating a kangaroo's penis in the Australian jungle right now', that's kind of not what they're hoping for.""
Hancock has previously stressed the first thing he will do after leaving the jungle will be to return to West Suffolk and hold a surgery with his constituents.
In an interview before heading into the celebrity jungle, he said: ""There are lots of different ways to communicate with the public and we [politicians] are wrong if we think you can only do that on the traditional political shows where you are mainly only talking to people who take an active interest in politics.""
Watch: Boy George in tears over Matt Hancock's participation on reality show
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak previously said Hancock's decision to enter the jungle was not ""noble"" because he was failing to prioritise his ""constituents and our country"".
On Tuesday, campaigners flew a banner over the I'm A Celebrity campsite, reading: ""Covid bereaved say get out of here!""
In June last year, Hancock resigned as Health Secretary after he was caught breaking coronavirus social distancing rules by having an affair in his ministerial office with Gina Coladangelo, who was his aide at the time.

business	Orkney Christmas businesses hit by Royal Mail strikes	"Businesses in Orkney have said they are being hit hard by the Royal Mail strikes in the build-up to Christmas.
Negotiations between the organisation and the CWU union, over pay and conditions, have stalled.
With uncertainty over delivery dates, some business owners in Orkney are reporting a drop in online sales.
Members of the CWU are due to continue striking on Sunday as well as on 14, 15, 23 and 24 December.
Judith Glue's knitwear shop has been a fixture on Kirkwall's Broad Street since 1979.
She was an early pioneer of online sales in Orkney, and now sends goods worldwide via her website. 
She says she has lost thousands of pounds of sales of Orcadian food hampers, as the postal strikes mean perishable items cannot be sent. 
""It's had quite a serious affect on our business,"" she said. 
""We made the decision to send them out in the first two weeks of December, but we're not guaranteeing Christmas delivery.""
She said they had moved to more non-perishable items - for example less smoked salmon and farmhouse cheese.
""Sadly, this has affected our suppliers as well, as we've not been able to order the same quantity as other years.
""This situation has shown how essential the Royal Mail is for Orkney. I don't think people realise how much the islands rely on the postal service.""
Sheila Fleet Jewellery is also based in Kirkwall, as well as having a gallery and cafe in Tankerness. 
r goods globally, using Orkney's airmail service to get the parcels to mainland Scotland.
""It's having a profound effect on our business,"" managing director Martin Fleet said.
""We rely on the Royal Mail's special delivery service, it's been a lifeline to us for many years.
""With the strikes coming up, our team has had to work incredibly hard to get as many parcels out as soon as we could, in order not to let any of our customers down."" 
He said they supported some of the reasons behind the strike, but said it had the potential to be ""absolutely devastating"" to the business.
""I really hope they can find a resolution, so that the universal postal service can continue,"" he said.
A Royal Mail spokesperson said: ""Royal Mail continues to deploy contingency plans to keep communities, businesses and the country connected throughout the CWU's industrial action.
""We apologise for any disruption and delay that CWU strike action is causing to our customers in Orkney.""
Last week, Royal Mail advised people to post Christmas mail earlier than usual.
CWU said staff want a pay rise to match the soaring cost of living and accused management of trying to ""force through thousands of compulsory redundancies"".
Royal Mail plans to cut 10,000 jobs by next August, including 5-6,000 redundancies. The company said it ""will do all we can to avoid compulsory redundancies, including offering a voluntary redundancy scheme"".

business	Elon Musk warns Twitter deal stuck without fake account proof	"Elon Musk has said his $44bn deal to buy Twitter may be in jeopardy due to a disagreement over the number of fake accounts on the social media platform.
Mr Musk tweeted that the deal ""cannot move forward"" unless Twitter backs up its claims that less than 5% of daily users are fake or spam accounts.
witter has defended its figures, adding that Mr Musk waived rights to ""due diligence"" to clinch the deal.
raised doubts about the takeover.
Analysts have speculated that Mr Musk may be looking for ways to renegotiate the price of the deal or walk away.
Mr Musk agreed the $44bn (£34.5bn) deal to buy Twitter with its board in April, but last week Mr Musk said the deal was ""on hold"" while he sought details about fake accounts.
He has continued to press the issue in tweets and public appearances, while also hinting that he could seek a lower price.
On Tuesday, Mr Musk said Twitter boss Parag Agrawal had ""publicly refused to show proof"" that fewer than 5% of its accounts were fake, and said the deal ""cannot move forward"" until Mr Agrawal does show proof.
Mr Musk's tweet then appeared to be deleted.
re, who also runs carmaker Tesla, has put the number of fake accounts at 20% or more.
Elon Musk has doubled down on his position that his deal to buy the social network is on ice while the actual amount of spambots and accounts operating on it is investigated.
witter chief executive Parag Agrawal has hit back, and tempers are flaring.
When the richest man in the world replies to one of your tweets with just one symbol, the poo emoji, well, I suppose at least you know you've got his attention.
I long ago gave up trying to read the mind of Elon Musk but let's indulge in a moment of speculation.
He's making a big deal about fake accounts. Is it a convenient peg on which to hang a renegotiation? His initial $44bn offer for the firm was considerably higher than its current stock suggests.
He moved swiftly and aggressively, perhaps even impulsively.
fund it, he's already had to sell a chunk of shares in one of his other companies, the electric car firm Tesla, and that in turn made a dent in the value of that company as it made other investors nervous.
If either party in the Twitter deal walks away now, there's a $1bn termination fee.
may sound like small change to a multi-billionaire - although Mr Musk maintains he is asset-rich rather than cash-rich - but it perhaps gives him leverage to successfully shave a few billion off the offer price, because $1bn is not small change to Twitter and its shareholders.
However, Mr Musk might be right to question Twitter's worth.
If it really isn't bloated with spam, then perhaps it has less potential to be made great again, a phrase that may sound familiar given that he has already indicated that he would like to re-instate former US President Donald Trump.
Mr Trump, by the way, has so far declined the invitation.
Mr Musk and Mr Agrawal have been publicly debating the spambot figures on Twitter but relations appear to have soured. 
On Monday, Mr Musk responded to Mr Agrawal's defence of the the firm's spam reporting with a poo emoji, later repeating his claim that Twitter was underestimating the figure.
Mr Musk has said he is concerned that advertisers on Twitter don't know what they are paying for.
""So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,"" he wrote.
After putting his offer on hold Mr Musk told a conference in Miami on Monday that ""you can't pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed"".
He said that a deal is ""not out of the question"" at a different price but added: ""The more questions I ask, the more my concerns grow.""
witter has said it is committed to completing the deal at the agreed price. 
In a filing with regulators on Tuesday, it told shareholders that Mr Musk's apparent eagerness to get the deal done, even without ordinary research into the business, set him apart from any other potential suitors.
""Other potential [buyers] would require substantial due diligence, creating a delay and risk to reaching the signing of such a potential transaction,"" it said.
Mr Musk has called for tests of random samples of Twitter users to identify bots. He said ""there is some chance it might be over 90% of daily active users"".
Researchers have estimated that anywhere from 4% to 20% or more of the millions of Twitter profiles are fake.
witter shares on Monday closed more than 8% down at $37.39, sowing doubts that Mr Musk would go ahead with his acquisition at the agreed price.
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that it ""looks increasingly likely that Elon Musk is positioning to renegotiate a sharply lower price tag for Twitter or even try and pull the pin on the deal"".
She said that establishing the number of real users on Twitter is considered ""vital to future revenue streams via advertising or paid for subscriptions on the site"".
""The volatility which has hit tech stocks and contributed to a sharp decline in Twitter's valuation is also highly likely to be part of the equation,"" Ms Streeter said, adding that Mr Musk is ""clearly rueing the timing of his rash offer to pay $44bn for the social network""."	/news/business-61432483

health	Glan Clwyd: Serious failings led to death of man - inquest	"A man died from bronchial pneumonia in hospital after information regarding his care was not transferred correctly, a coroner's court has heard.
A hearing into the death of David Schofield Diamond found ""serious failings"" at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire.
79-year-old was admitted with pneumonia and sepsis two weeks before his death in November 2021.
Betsi Cadwaladr health board told the inquest plans to improve had been made.
Mr Diamond, from Prestatyn, had also tested positive for Covid-19 and was having difficulties eating and drinking. 
He was initially placed in the high dependency area of the Covid ward and his breathing was assisted, the hearing was told.
He was also assessed by the speech and language team, who recommended a soft diet of mildly thickened fluids. 
After about 10 days, his condition began to improve and healthcare staff discussed a discharge plan with him and his daughter. 
But when he was moved into another area on the same ward, the information regarding his fluids and diet was not transferred with him to the whiteboard above his new bed. 
ree days before his death, a physiotherapist noticed unthickened drinks on his bedside table, some of which had been consumed. 
On 11 November, Mr Diamond's condition deteriorated to a point where an assessment should have been made by the on-call doctor, with two-hourly observations then taken, and the nurse-in-charge informed. 
However, no observations were made for seven hours and the nurse-in-charge was not told. 
His condition continued to deteriorate and he became unresponsive. A chest X-ray showed there had been aspiration, and he was placed on intravenous antibiotics, but Mr Diamond died on 13 November. 
In a statement read to the coroner's court in Ruthin, the bank nurse looking after Mr Diamond overnight, Gwenda Long, said she had assumed the healthcare support team would do Mr Diamond's two-hourly observations. 
She said she did not escalate his condition to the nurse-in-charge or the assessment team because she had ""misread the term ward-based care"" in his notes, and thought medical escalation was not necessary. 
Giving a narrative conclusion, David Lewis, assistant coroner for north Wales, east and central, said the case showed a ""lack of recognition of deteriorating patient"" with ""human and communication errors"" involved. 
Mr Lewis said that though Mr Diamond had died from pneumonia, a natural cause, the aspiration that played a part was not natural, and it was ""likely"" he aspirated due to consumption of unthickened fluid in the hospital, in spite of recommendations. 
Mr Lewis added that though he could not be satisfied that it would have made a difference to Mr Diamond had a doctor been called at an earlier stage when his condition deteriorated, there had been ""serious failings"" in his care.  
Jane Woollard, associate director of nursing for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board told the inquest that an improvement plan had been put in place following an investigation into Mr Diamond's death, which included the introduction of colour-coded information sheets on dietary requirements which move around the hospital with patients and a plan to train all nurses to carry out swallow assessments. 
Mr Diamond's daughter, Jody Diamond said she felt let down and was ""heartbroken"" by the loss of her father. "	/news/uk-wales-63639930

ries sees all-electric SUVs racing across five remote territories to raise awareness of climate issues.
Each X-Prix features an equal mix of male and female competitors, with Britons Jenson Button and Jamie Chadwick billed as some of the contenders who will take part.
Extreme E will be broadcast live across the BBC.
Deserts, glaciers, rainforests... the places Extreme E visits are wildly different but have a common theme - highlighting the issue of climate change and its impact on various regions around the world.
ries has consulted with ecological experts to ensure the impact of its presence in these areas will be kept to a minimum, while scientists will also travel with the teams to investigate the effects of climate change.
ransportation of people and equipment to each region will be via an ex-Royal Mail cargo ship - the RMS St Helena - which has been modified to act as a 'floating paddock'.
re are also plans to ensure the series leaves a lasting legacy in each of the areas it heads to, including tree-planting, clean-up operations and solar-power initiatives.
No. Instead, the whole series will be broadcast on television and streamed online, with filming done by drones, not helicopters.
Extreme E will also create documentaries on each of the races' locations to highlight the issues they face.
Qualifying takes place on day one to determine the top three runners, who will progress through to a semi-final, with the top two making the final.
m next three (fourth to sixth) of qualifying go on to the 'crazy race'. The fastest team in that completes the two X-Prix finalists.
races are over two laps of about 16km, with four teams - all made up of one male and one female driver - going head to head.
A variety of drivers from different motor racing disciplines are taking part.
As well as W Series champion Chadwick, 2009 F1 world champion Jenson Button will be taking part in his own team. Seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton and his former rival at Mercedes Nico Rosberg will also run their own teams, with Hamilton employing rally legend Sebastien Loeb and Cristina Gutierrez to do the driving.
""This is a first in motor racing,"" said Extreme E founder Alejandro Agag. ""We are ensuring with our sporting format that drivers of all backgrounds will be able to compete with the same tools at their disposal at every event on the calendar.
""We are striving for equality, and this sporting format is the truest reflection of that goal.""
re are nine teams signed up with some significant names involved, including ex-Formula 1 design guru Adrian Newey who, alongside 2019 Formula E champion Jean Eric-Vergne, founded the Veloce Team.
Agag, founder of the Formula E series, announced the project in January 2019.
49-year-old Spanish politician-turned-businessman says he was motivated to create Extreme E by the successful launch of Formula E, which is now in its seventh year and established on the motorsport calendar.
""Extreme E is only possible because of what happened with Formula E,"" Agag added.
""People have questioned whether Extreme E can actually happen, but less than they did when we launched Formula E. It has been key to giving us energy, and we've gained credibility."""	/sport/motorsport/53545698

Rishi Sunak continues to forge ahead in the race, gathering the support of 128 MPs from all wings of his party, including former Johnson allies.
Mr Johnson is in second place with 53 backers, according to the BBC's tally.
However his campaign claims he has the support of 100 MPs - the number required to officially enter the race.
Mr Sunak's supporters raised doubts over this and called for the former PM to show proof. 
Penny Mordaunt is the only candidate to officially declare they are in the race, but she lags behind on support with 23 MPs.

If the party's MPs get behind just one candidate, we could have a new prime minister by Monday afternoon.
But if not, it will then go to an online ballot of the Conservative party membership, with the result to be announced on Friday. 
Polling suggests Mr Johnson, who has returned from a Caribbean holiday to consider his options, would be favourite to win a members' vote. 
roughout Saturday, MPs were publicly declaring support for their favoured candidate.
Mr Sunak picked up backing from all wings of his party, including the right, and from figures like Mr Johnson's former Chief of Staff Steve Barclay, his former Brexit Minister Lord Frost, Kemi Badenoch, the International Trade Secretary and Northern Ireland Minister Steve Baker.
Mr Baker - an influential MP on the right of the party - said Mr Johnson would be a ""guaranteed disaster"", and specifically expressed concern about an ongoing parliamentary investigation into whether the ex-prime minister lied to Parliament over Covid rule-breaking. 
He told Sky News a large number of Conservative MPs would ""refuse to lay down their integrity"" in order to defend Mr Johnson on the issue. 
Ms Badenoch, who made a big impact in the last Tory leadership contest but has ruled herself out this time, said in the Sunday Times that Mr Sunak was ""the serious, honest leader we need"".
Mr Sunak, who has yet to officially declare he is standing, also has the support of former chancellor and health secretary Sajid Javid, Security Minister Tom Tugendhat, former deputy prime minister Dominic Raab.
Pointing to the parliamentary probe facing Mr Johnson, Mr Raab told the BBC: ""We cannot go backwards. We cannot have another episode of the Groundhog Day, of the soap opera of Partygate"". 
He said he was very confident Mr Sunak would stand, adding: ""I think the critical issue here is going to be the economy. Rishi had the right plan in the summer and I think it is the right plan now.""
former PM has so far won the support of six Cabinet ministers: Ben Wallace, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Simon Clarke, Chris Heaton-Harris, Alok Sharma and Anne-Marie Trevelyan.
Also among supporters of Boris Johnson is former home secretary Priti Patel who said he could bring together a united team and lead the UK to a stronger and more prosperous future.
An ally of former home secretary Suella Braverman told the PA news agency she had been ""heavily courted"" by both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak and was likely to decide who to back on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Andrea Leadsom, former business secretary, said Ms Mordaunt was the unifying candidate; an experienced minister and a ""robust Brexiteer"".
Writing in the Express on Sunday, Ms Mordaunt set out her plan to ""unite the party and the country"" and said the Tories had ""let ourselves become distracted by internal disputes"".
She stressed the need to ""make Brexit work"", ""focus on the potential of all our citizens"" and ""defend our Union and its territorial integrity"".
Conservative MP Bob Seely said ""I think we owe the country a collective responsibility to apologise"" and said he believes Ms Mordaunt has the best chance of providing ""unity and leadership"" within the party.
Mr Johnson's potential bid to return to power comes just seven weeks after his final day in No 10.
His successor, Liz Truss, is the UK's shortest-serving prime minister, stepping down after 45 days in power.
She announced her resignation on Thursday, after a series of humiliating U-turns forced on her by an adverse reaction to her tax policies in the financial markets."	/news/uk-politics-63361384
business	John Lewis and DFS warn shoppers are spending less	"Retailers John Lewis and DFS have said customers are cutting back on the amount they spend due to the rising cost of living.
John Lewis said while shopper numbers were higher than last year, customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items.
""No one could have predicted the scale of the cost of living crisis,"" said John Lewis boss Dame Sharon White.
mpany reported a loss of £99m for the first half of its trading year.
Sofa retailer DFS Furniture reported slumping annual profits due to a dip in consumer spending, saying order numbers had ""softened markedly"" as shoppers tightened their belts.
Also on Thursday, fashion chain H&M filed lower-than-expected quarterly sales., but said it had seen a ""better start for the autumn collections than last year"".
Dame Sharon said customers were less likely to splash out on ""big ticket"" household items and were moving their spending to dining out at restaurants and to holidays.
""No one could have predicted the scale of the cost of living crisis that has materialised, with energy prices and inflation rising ahead of anyone's expectations,"" she said.
""As a business, we have faced unprecedented cost inflation across grocery and general merchandise.""
However, she said it was ""not unusual"" for the John Lewis Partnership to report a loss in the first half of the year as its trading is ""heavily skewed"" to Christmas, with most of its profits made in the final months of the year.
In the first half of last year, the partnership reported a loss of £29m.
mpany said its losses this year were due to a combination of rising wholesale prices for goods not being passed on to customers, households cutting back on spending, and the ""unwinding"" of Covid shopping habits.
It said it chose to ""forgo"" profit to help staff and customers through the cost-of-living crisis. The employee-owned group announced a £500 one-off payment to full-time workers, with a pro-rata amount for those working part-time, to support staff.
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ""fight is on for consumers' remaining disposable cash"".
She said DFS was the ""latest"" company to warn of the the ""painful effects"" of inflation. 
""DFS is not only having to cope with a slowdown due to purchases which were brought forward during the pandemic, but now as household bills mount for essentials like food and heating, a plush new sofa is a luxury many consumers are happy to do without,"" she said.
Overall UK inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, is running near a 40-year high, but the rate eased for the first time in almost a year in August, slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%.
Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills, and Waitrose said its sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes ""smaller by nearly a fifth"".
Bank of England has warned inflation could top 13% this year, and is expected to keep increasing interest rates in an attempt to control it.
John Lewis said its fashion sales increased as people shopped for travel and summer breaks. However, revenue from its home and technology ranges, which performed well during the height of the pandemic, declined.
mpany said the impact of the rise in the cost of living, specifically around energy costs, was ""evident in patterns of spending"", with sales of its own-brand items rising 28% and energy saving goods, such as air fryers and smart thermostats, increasing.
Dame Sharon said the outlook for the rest of the year was ""highly uncertain owing to the cost of living crisis and its impact on discretionary spending as well as criticality of our Christmas trading period"".
She said a successful Christmas was ""key for the business"", adding a bumper festive period beyond previous years was needed to ""generate sufficient profit"" for the company to be able to pay staff their usual bonus.
Last month, Dame Sharon told the BBC that an exodus of over-50s who left the workforce during the Covid pandemic had fuelled wage inflation.
UK has seen one million people, mostly in their 50s, leave work since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, with job vacancies at a record high.
It has meant employers who want to attract and retain staff are under pressure to lift wages, which in turn fuels inflation."	/news/business-62911971

Conservatives have given their MPs until 5 December to confirm whether they wish to contest the next election - which must be held by early 2025.
So far, 11 Tory MPs have announced they will not stand for re-election.

Levelling Up minister Dehenna Davison, Chloe Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, and Will Wragg, the chair of the public administration select committee, have all said they will stand down.
Uxbridge and South Ruislip Conservative association said it ""fully supported Boris Johnson as our local MP and candidate at any future election"".

Jazz singer Ni Maxine and indie pop band TRAITS performed in Liverpool's 20 Forthlin Road, where the track was written by Sir Paul and John Lennon.

g of the Regent in Redcar, which replaced its 1920s-built predecessor, had to be delayed because a new operator could not be found.
Its opening was again put back after operator Merlin ordered building work to take place to make room to sell snacks in the foyer. 
It said 700 people applied for 20 jobs at the Art Deco-inspired venue.
Regent closed in 2018 and was bulldozed after being declared unsafe.
first films to be screened at the new venue include musical comedy Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile and the DC superhero movie Black Adam, starring The Rock. 
Operas, ballets, concerts and live shows will also be beamed via satellite to the cinema from other venues including The Royal Opera House and the National Theatre. 
w cinema has three screens and can seat up to 200 people.
It was paid for by £9.6m funding from the Tees Valley Combined Authority.

technology	Twitter drama continues with blue-tick confusion	"witter halted its new $8 blue tick subscription offering on Friday in the latest head spinning reversal at the social media platform since billionaire Elon Musk bought the company. 
move came as a number of accounts impersonating big brands received the blue tick, previously a signal that the firm had verified the user as real.
In one instance, a user claiming to be drugs firm Eli Lilly said ""insulin was free"". 
witter did not comment.
rns about how Mr Musk's leadership was affecting the spread of misinformation on the platform. 
""We apologize to those who have been served a misleading message from a fake Lilly account,"" Eli Lilly tweeted a few hours after the prank post went up on Thursday, reiterating the name of its real Twitter handle. 
firm's shares fell 4% on Friday amid the confusion. 
US-based PR strategist Max Burns said he had seen fake accounts with the verified blue tick badge bought through Twitter Blue posing as support accounts for real airlines and asking customers who were trying to contact them on Twitter to direct message the fake accounts instead.
""How long until a prankster takes a real passenger's ticket information and cancels their flight? Or takes their credit card info and goes on a spending spree?"" he said.
""It will only take one major incident for every airline to bail on Twitter as a source of customer engagement.""
Mr Musk completed his $44bn purchase of Twitter late last month, and swiftly set about overhauling the company.
He has fired roughly 3,700 people - about half of the company's former staff - and pushed the firm to focus on finding ways other than advertising to make money.
His first email to employees warned: ""The road ahead is arduous and will require intense work to succeed.""
""Without significant subscription revenue, there is a good chance Twitter will not survive the upcoming economic downturn,"" he said.
firm's troubles as the digital ad market hits a downturn have been compounded as big brands and marketing firms halt spending on the platform amid concern about its direction.
witter Blue subscription service asked users to pay £6.99 ($7.99) per month for a blue tick, a symbol that was previously free.
move immediately raised concerns about fake accounts - the reason that Twitter had first introduced the system.
Lou Paskalis, president of marketing firm MMA Global, wrote on Twitter that Mr Musk needed to appoint a new chief executive and commit to stepping away from the company's operations. 
""It's clear that leading Twitter is not among your many talents,"" he wrote.
Mr Musk had also said Twitter users engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying a ""parody"" account would be permanently suspended without a warning. 
Several fake brand accounts, including those of Nintendo and BP, have been suspended. 
Mr Musk's actions have prompted the departures of a rash of high-profile executives who had survived the staff cuts, including people in charge of protecting user data.
""I've made the hard decision to leave Twitter,"" tweeted chief security officer Lea Kissner.
Federal Trade Commission on Thursday said it was watching events with ""deep concern"".
Yoel Roth, the site's head of trust and safety, also resigned just a day after staunchly defending Mr Musk's content moderation policy to advertisers.
Late on Thursday, Mr Roth's Twitter bio described him as ""Former Head of Trust & Safety at @Twitter.""
Mr Roth had became the public face of Twitter's content moderation after Mr Musk took over. 
Mr Musk had praised him for defending Twitter's ongoing efforts to fight harmful misinformation and hate speech.
I've heard Twitter in its current state described as an aeroplane, mid-flight, without pilots.
udden departure of the head of trust and safety, the chief information security officer, and both the chief privacy and compliance officers is a dramatic development. It's not clear how soon they will be replaced, while the firm remains this unstable and sweeping job cuts have already been made. 
From a security perspective, Twitter will, like all big platforms, be a constant target for hackers and bad actors around the world, meaning it cannot afford to take its eye off the ball and it must continue to ensure that its systems are robust, and threats are monitored. 
As for users' privacy, you don't need me to tell you how important that is. And indeed, as we've seen, the US regulators are already keeping a very close eye on what's going on. 
Elon Musk, on the other hand, says engagement and user numbers are higher than ever. We only have his word for it - I have to say that anecdotally I'm seeing plenty of Twitter Blue subscribers who seem happy with their new ""blue tick"". And however many of them there are, that's all fresh income that the firm did not previously have.  
But it's also causing its own headache because now anybody can have a badge which until very recently was a symbol of authenticity - including fakes.   And the confusion continues as this service appears to have been paused.
Musk has also said that bankruptcy is not out of the question. While it may feel like we are watching Twitter speeding towards the edge of a cliff, I think it's too early to tell whether it will manage to put the brakes on in time. In the early days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg's motto was ""move fast and break things"" - Elon Musk appears to have taken this to another level. "	/news/technology-63597087
health	Gambling: Former Tonbridge addict calls for preventative education	"A former gambling addict who ""lost everything"" has called for government action and changes to the industry.
Justyn Larcombe, from Tonbridge, wants new measures to be introduced after his addiction made him consider taking his own life.
Online gambling has caused a rise in suicidal young men turning to A&E, a new report has said.
A Betting and Gaming Council spokesperson said £100m has been pledged to tackle gambling harm.
Mr Larcombe's life was left ""in ruins"" after addiction cost him his wife, two sons, house, car and six-figure salary job.
Mr Larcombe thinks ""prevention and education is better than any cure"", and wants the dangers of a gambling addiction included in the school curriculum. 
He also said the industry ""needs to do more"" and supports a compulsory levy to fund addiction treatment.
former Army major said his addiction started after placing a £5 bet during a rugby match in 2009. 
As people celebrate the World Cup, Mr Larcombe wants people to be aware of the dangers of getting sucked in as it is ""so easy to get into gambling now"", particularly online.
NHS bosses claim online gambling is causing a rise in people ending up in A&E, particularly young men. A 42% annual rise in demand for NHS gambling clinics has resulted in the need to open another two facilities in England to cope.
A Betting and Gaming Council spokesperson said £100m in funding has been pledged for research, education and treatment services and their prevention programme has reached two million young people.
A Gambling Commission spokesperson said preventing gambling harm was at the ""heart"" of their work and they continue the drive to ""make gambling safer for everyone.""

health	UK zoonotic research site left to deteriorate - MPs	"UK's main facility for dealing with viruses that jump from animals to humans has been left to ""deteriorate to an alarming extent,"" according to MPs.
Public Affairs Committee report cited ""inadequate management and under-investment"" at the site in Weybridge.
It said the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) had ""comprehensively failed in its historical management"" of the centre. 
Defra said work was already under way to upgrade the laboratories.
re is operated by the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). It is central to the UK's ability to control the outbreak of animal diseases and detect any emerging pathogens.
Public Accounts Committee found more than ""1,000 single points of failure"" at the Weybridge site. 
Its report said deterioration had left the laboratories ""continually vulnerable to a major breakdown"" which would severely impact the UK's ability to effectively respond to outbreaks. 
Some of the deadliest viruses on earth are ""zoonotic diseases"" that cross between species such as Covid-19, Sars or Ebola.
report said the risk to the UK of a zoonotic disease was ""real and the consequences can be devastating"", and accused the government of not sufficiently prioritising this threat to ""UK health, trade, farming and rural communities.""
Committee chairwoman Dame Meg Hillier said: ""After the 2001 disaster of foot and mouth disease, the past decades have brought one animal-sourced disease after another. 
""It is shocking that government has allowed UK capacity in this area to deteriorate so alarmingly over that same period,"" she said. ""These diseases are devastating for our food production systems, the economy and, when they jump the species barrier to humans as Covid-19 did, to our whole society.""
UK and EU are currently in the grip of a record avian flu outbreak that has led to the culling of 48 million birds.
Prof Paul Wigley, professor of animal microbial ecosystems at the University of Bristol, warned that avian flu ""had the potential to jump to other species including us.""
""Weybridge has always been a central resource of facilities and people. It has been placed in a perilous position by underfunding and crumbling facilities,"" he said. ""Without support it is increasingly unlikely the UK could cope with another major outbreak of animal or zoonotic disease along with the ongoing avian influenza epidemic.""
government has plans to redevelop the site, with the construction of a new science hub due to start in 2027. However the level of funding needed is still not finalised.
Prof James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at University of Cambridge, said that the ""steady decline"" of the facility had been clear. 
""We can no longer be reliant on laboratory resources from partner European laboratories. The significance of laboratories is demonstrated clearly by their central role in the diagnosis and control of the ongoing unprecedented avian influenza outbreak.
""The current major Weybridge redevelopment programme is very welcome and important but it will take many years to be implemented and there are risks of laboratory failure occurring in the meantime.""
A Defra spokesperson said: ""Significant funding and work is already underway to upgrade (Weybridge's) laboratories and ensure we are protected from these diseases into the future.
""Its world-leading scientists and our field teams are playing a vital role in responding rapidly and decisively to the threats from animal diseases, including the current Avian Influenza outbreak, which is the largest on record.""

entertainment	Wagatha Christie case: Judgement at a glance	"One of the most talked about celebrity disputes has now come to an end. Rebekah Vardy has lost her defamation case against Coleen Rooney - the so-called Wagatha Christie libel trial.
Mrs Rooney had in a social media post accused Mrs Vardy of leaking private stories about her - stemming from her Instagram account - to The Sun. 
High Court judge Mrs Justice Karen Steyn has ruled that accusation was ""substantially true"".
And in a 75-page judgement, the judge made a number of scathing or illuminating observations on the case. 
""I find that it is, unfortunately, necessary to treat Mrs Vardy's evidence with very considerable caution,"" said Mrs Justice Steyn.
""Mrs Vardy was generally unwilling to make factual concessions, however implausible her evidence.
""This inevitably affects my overall view of her credibility, although I have borne in mind that untruthful evidence may be given to mask guilt or to fortify innocence.""
urt heard the phone of Mrs Vardy's then-agent Caroline Watt could not be submitted as evidence because it fell into the North Sea while she was filming the Scottish coastline. 
Mrs Vardy also claimed some of her conversations with Ms Watt were wiped, denying she destroyed any evidence. 
""The timing is striking,"" said the judge. ""In my judgement... the likelihood that the loss Ms Watt describes was accidental is slim.
""In my judgement it is likely that Mrs Vardy deliberately deleted her WhatsApp chat with Ms Watt, and that Ms Watt deliberately dropped her phone in the sea.""
Mrs Rooney's primary defence was that seven stories based on information on her private Instagram account had appeared in the Sun newspaper, saying it was as a result of leaks by Mrs Vardy. 
She accused Mrs Vardy of using Ms Watt as a conduit to the press. 
""It is likely that Ms Watt undertook the direct act, in relation to each post, of passing the information to a journalist at the Sun,"" Mrs Justice Steyn said. 
""Nonetheless, the evidence... clearly shows, in my view, that Mrs Vardy knew of and condoned this behaviour, actively engaging in it by directing Mrs Watt to the private Instagram account, sending her screenshots of Mrs Rooney's posts, drawing attention to items of potential interest to the press, and answering additional queries raised by the press via Ms Watt.""
Mrs Vardy denied she sat behind Mrs Rooney during a Euro 2016 football match in order to allow a photo agency to a get a photograph with the pair in the same shot. 
urt heard Mrs Vardy had in fact been allocated seats several rows in front of Mrs Rooney.
Mrs Rooney said Mrs Vardy had shown ""publicity-seeking behaviour"" in sitting behind her. 
""As the wife of the England captain, and having already been in the public eye for about 14 years by then, Ms Rooney had a higher public profile than Mrs Vardy,"" said the judge. 
""It is highly likely that Mrs Vardy ended up sitting directly behind Mrs Rooney, in circumstances where that was not her allocated seat, due to a deliberate choice to put herself in the same shot.""
""Some members of the public have responded to the reveal post by subjecting Mrs Vardy to vile abuse, including messages wishing her, her family, and even her (then unborn) baby, ill in the most awful terms,"" reads the judgement.
""Nothing of which Mrs Vardy has been accused, not any of the findings in this judgement, provide any justification or excuse for subjecting her or her family, or any other person involved in this case, to such vitriol.""
""In my judgement, Mrs Rooney was an honest and reliable witness,"" said Mrs Justice Steyn. 
""She sought to answer the questions she was asked without any evasion, and without conveying any sense that she was giving pre-prepared answers.""
""Mrs Vardy was keen to be the subject of (positive) press coverage and it is apparent that she thought Ms Rooney was, too,"" said the judge. 
""Mrs Vardy's perception seems to have been that the information on the private Instagram account was harmless and, when Mrs Rooney repeatedly made clear her objection to her private posts being given to the press, Mrs Vardy seems to have viewed this as making a fuss about nothing and attention-seeking."""	/news/uk-62345915
entertainment	Eurovision 2023: Glasgow or Liverpool will host song contest	"Either Glasgow or Liverpool will host next year's Eurovision Song Contest, after the shortlist of cities in contention was cut from seven to two.
uncement means Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield have missed out on the chance to stage the competition next May.
BBC said the two remaining cities, which both have riverside arena venues, had ""the strongest overall offer"".
A final decision will be made ""within weeks"", the broadcaster said.
UK was chosen to host the 2023 contest after organisers decided it could not be staged by this year's winner, Ukraine, because of the ongoing war. The UK's singer Sam Ryder was the runner-up this May.
A hotly-contested selection process saw 20 UK cities express an interest in hosting next year's show before that was narrowed down to seven, and now a final two.
winning location will attract thousands of visitors and the attention of around 160 million TV viewers around the world.
riginal seven shortlisted cities were scored on a set of criteria including: 
Glasgow was a bookies' favourite from the off, with its OVO Hydro venue having a capacity of 14,300.
rena would be a fitting setting in some ways after being filmed for the exterior of the venue in Will Ferrell's 2020 Netflix movie Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.
And of course, Glasgow lass Lulu won the 1969 Contest with Boom Bang-a-Bang. She says it's ""the perfect place... and it's about time"". 
Fellow Glaswegian Scott Fitzgerald came second in 1988 when he was beaten to the top spot by none other than Celine Dion.
r of Glasgow City Council said the city has ""everything it takes"" to host Eurovision.
""The competition has been very strong but Glasgow has an unrivalled track record for successfully hosting major global events,"" Susan Aitken said.

entertainment	The Fabs: How a '60s all-girl band (nearly) ruled the world	"""You're fabulous, fabulous to be with.""
So sang 1960s girl group The Fabs of their imagined loves. 
But in truth, the fabulous ones were the performers on stage.
It was a time where not many women played guitar and drums, but band leader Wally ""Waldini"" Bishop wanted to change that. 
He formed the quartet who would become The Fabs, whose story is being re-told in the Cardiff Music History: City of Sound exhibition.
One of the four was Sarah Wrigley, nee Johnston, a 19-year-old Cardiff girl whose musician father had taught her to play the guitar.
She said Wally Bishop had a show with dancers in Ilfracombe, Devon, but decided in 1963 to form a girl band in a similar vein to the Beatles. 
Sarah said Wally heard about her through her father and got the other girls, who did not play instruments, the gear and lessons they needed. 
Sarah said the quartet - her on lead guitar, Linda Mazey from Barry on drums, Margaret Lewis from Bedwas on bass guitar, and Newport's Maria Kitsom on rhythm guitar - were a bit of a ""novelty"" for those watching them in the summer of 1964.
""We did three or four numbers of the day which only required three or four chords… and we were very popular with the audiences.""
After the season, an offer came for a contract to perform for US bases in Germany for American GIs.
Sarah said the band all had ""good figures"" and wore ""all the gear all the time"".  
""The guys absolutely loved us,"" she added. ""It didn't really matter what we sounded like, to be perfectly honest, however I have to say after four months of playing six nights a week four hours a night, we did rapidly improve.""
group going back and forth to Germany as well as playing clubs in south Wales. 
But the band faced disparaging jokes made by boy bands they performed alongside, including from a future rock star. 
""We worked with The Who at one point. Roger Daltrey said to me as I came off stage from our spot, 'you're quite good, love, but you won't get anywhere' as pop groups were 'all boys'."" 
She said the band knew they were a ""novelty"", but also knew they had become good at playing and said they were not put off by Daltrey's comments.
After a year, Wally Bishop died. It did not stop The Fabs.
Sarah said: ""We'd been back and forth to Germany quite a bit, and we could drive, we could look after ourselves, we kind of knew our way around. So we decided to carry on by ourselves.""
Sarah said the group, despite being young and female, were treated well, were well paid and ""having a great time"". 
group performed covers of popular songs, but Sarah did write ""a few ditties"", including their theme tune You're Fabulous.
""We could throw [them] into the show so weren't doing totally all covers. We didn't worry about learning new songs all the time.
""Linda used to do a drum solo which used to raise the roof and they absolutely loved her doing that.""
women also found the attitude abroad towards them quite different, facing less sexism when they travelled to Spain, the Azores and Turkey, proving popular wherever they went. 
In 1967, the band were offered a contract for a nightclub residency in Mexico City, where the Olympic Games were to be held in 1968.
Despite being offered six months, they stayed for a year, living in an apartment and travelling to Acapulco on days off. 
rubbed shoulders with Hollywood. One evening, a rumour went around that film star Steve McQueen was there. 
During a break, Sarah slipped out to see if she could glimpse The Great Escape star, before feeling a tap on her shoulder. 
""I turned and he said 'Hi, my name's Steve. I saw you guys playing. You're great, what are you doing here?'""
She had to get back on stage, but - although the band would not initially believe her - McQueen arranged to meet the quartet afterward.
went to an all-night dinner together, and Sarah said, he was ""so interested in us"" and ""wanted to know what four Welsh girls were doing here"". 
ut a record while in Mexico to be sold in the club.
""In the UK people would spend weeks, months, longer, making an album. We did it in a day,"" Sarah laughed.
work visas for the USA, but American businessmen who befriended the girls paid for them to come to San Francisco to perform in a charity concert.
""To come home and say to people we've been to San Francisco, in '68, '69 - it was a massive time for flower power and all the stuff that was going on there.""
Encouraged by a visiting UK singer who said they should be back in the UK ""being a big hit"", they returned home, changed their name to The Jonson Sisters and appeared on the popular talent show Opportunity Knocks, which had 20 million viewers.
""We did go on and amazingly we won,"" said Sarah. ""We started to think, maybe this is it, maybe it's going to happen. We had lots and lots of work, we went up and down the country.""
were also offered a record contract, but despite cutting tracks at Rockfield studios in Monmouth in 1971, the producer told them he still could not sell the idea of a girl band to the big record companies.
After eight years together, things were also changing within the band. 
""Linda was married, Maggie was engaged, I think Maria was engaged, I was seeing the guy who was our road manager. We had other people to consider where we went and what we did.""
r final appearance was at Cardiff's New Theatre panto in the winter of 1971-72. 
remained friends, even attempting a comeback in the late 70s as Honky Tonk Women and Sarah later became a solo performer. 
David Taylor, who runs Cardiff Music History, came across the band when doing research for his site.
He has not found any other all-women bands in Wales from that period.
""I think that's what I found interesting, that they were four girls from south Wales at a time when it was so totally dominated by men.
""And not just that they were four girls, but that the music is really good. They were a really good band.""
Fabs feature in the exhibition as part of Llais at Wales Millennium Centre, while Sarah will speak on an all-women panel there on Saturday.
During lockdown, she used the enforced time at home to write her memoir, titled Twenty Pairs of Pants and a Passport.
She said: ""It was the travelling that really made our lives so adventurous and exciting. 
""Yes, it was great to get up on stage, we loved it, but to find ourselves in Mexico, Acapulco, San Francisco - when we look back, that travelling actually was for us an unbelievable happening."""	/news/uk-wales-63313669
politics	NI Protocol: Businesses question government's plans	"A consortium of business organisations has asked the UK government dozens of questions about how the replacement for the NI Protocol will work in practice.
rotocol is the post-Brexit trading deal agreed by the UK and the EU.
UK plans to override most of the agreement if the EU does not agree to changes.
questions from the NI Business Brexit Working Group suggest it is still unclear how UK unilateral measures would work on the ground.
It has called on the UK and EU to have businesses in Northern Ireland deeply involved in technical talks, warning that without that role there is a risk of ""misunderstandings and contradictions…resulting in further delay and controversy"".
rotocol keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, preventing checks on items at the Irish border and giving Northern Ireland manufacturers preferential access to the EU.
It also means there are checks and controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, leading to added cost and complexity for importing businesses.
UK government says the protocol is not working and needs to be changed, preferably by negotiation.
It is also proceeding with legislation, the Protocol Bill, which would see the UK make unilateral changes.
ges it is proposing include the concept of green lanes and red lanes.
rusted traders would use a green lane for GB goods that are destined only for Northern Ireland, meaning that would not need to be checked and would have minimal paperwork.
Goods destined to travel onwards to the Republic of Ireland would enter via a red lane, where they would be subject to standard EU controls and checks.
Alongside that is a plan for a dual regulatory regime, which would mean goods made to either EU or UK standard could be sold in Northern Ireland.
framework to empower the government to act, with the substance of these plans to be worked out later.
working group, whose members include the CBI, NI Chamber of Commerce and Ulster Farmers' Union have posed their questions in a consultation on the bill.
focus most of their queries on how the green lane and trusted trader concepts will work.
For example they want to know if the NI customer, the GB supplier, the haulier or all three would need to be a ""trusted trader"" for the purposes of the green lane.
ked if goods which have not been definitively categorised as staying in NI would by default have to use red lane procedures.
re is also a pointed question on the dual regulatory regime which asks the government to confirm ""whether there are any international precedents for introducing a full dual regulatory regime of similar size and scale with an open land border which it is using to inform its decision making?""
It's understood the government has engaged at length on the issues raised but no firm commitments have been given on how implementation will work.
working group also reiterates its view that the floor for any new agreement is the existing standstill arrangements and grace periods - not full implementation of the protocol."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63629061
health	Bristol team developing 'smart' menstrual cup and app	"A ""smart"" menstrual cup is being developed that aims to help empower women to get appropriate medical treatment and diagnosis.   
'Emm' cup is being developed by a Bristol team and is a reusable cup made from medical-grade silicone.
Currently in the second phase of testing, it is set to be launched in 2023.
GP and menopause expert Dr Julia Balfour said the Emm cup could reduce the need for invasive medical testing.
roduct aims to track the flow, volume, rate and regularity of menstruation and has sensors that connect with a smart phone app.
It has been designed to allow the user to track irregularities or changes in their cycle that could indicate a health issue, and its developers say it can also tell the user when the cup needs emptying.
Dr Balfour said certain female health conditions currently require invasive testing procedures and it would be ""lovely to imagine a world where this is being done effortlessly by a menstrual cup"".
CEO and founder Jenny Button said she had seen an opportunity to create a product that allowed women to ""non-invasively"" track their reproductive health.
""I wanted better health outcomes for women with the gender health gap,"" she said.
She said menstrual blood was rich in ""biomarkers"", which can provide information about health.
However, she said many woman were unable to identify reproductive symptoms due to not having access to their own menstrual health data.
One of the most common reasons women visit their doctor is due to heavy bleeding, says Ms Button, adding that one in five women suffer from menorrhagia - a condition that causes heavy menstrual bleeding.
""No one has the information on their menstrual volume at present, so diagnosis requires invasive tests or individual subjective recall of product usage."" 
Ms Button also hopes to encourage more women to transition to menstrual cups, reducing the number of period products that go to landfill each year.

technology	Twitter UK staff get deadline over cuts consultation	"witter staff in the UK who face losing their jobs have been given three days to nominate someone to represent them in a formal consultation about their employment.
Under UK employment law a consultation has to be carried out before redundancies can be made.
An email seen by the BBC from Twitter's European HR department says they have until 0900 Tuesday to decide who to put forward, and was sent on Friday night.
Staff can nominate themselves.
If there are more than 10 nominations, an election will be held, the email said, although there were no details offered as to how this would be organised.
It comes after Elon Musk, the company's new owner, said he had ""no choice"" but to cut 50% of Twitter's staff worldwide.
Mr Musk said the firm he bought for $44bn at the end of October is currently losing around $4m per day.
first Twitter layoffs were announced one day after Mr Musk bought the company.
CEO Parag Agrawal was among the workers who received their notice, with around half of Twitter's 7,500 staff expected to be cut. 
Following the announcement, the workers union Prospect said it now has ""dozens"" of Twitter UK staff members on its books.
If more than 100 people in the UK are affected by a firm's job cuts then there must be a 45-day consultation before any redundancies can be made, it added.
A senior official told the BBC three days was a very short time frame for people to organise themselves or communicate with each other, especially given that most still have frozen access to company-wide work platforms such as the messaging service Slack and their Twitter email accounts.
Seven days was considered a ""reasonable"" period of time for this to take place, she said, although there is no official rule. 
Mr Musk first announced he wanted to buy Twitter for $44bn in April - but it took a long and tumultuous six months for a deal to be struck. 
In July, the tech billionaire said he had pulled out of the sale because he had not been given enough information on how many real, active Twitter users there were.
witter responded by taking Mr Musk to court so that he would honour the sale.
urt case was then stalled when Mr Musk announced that he had bought the platform for $44bn at the end of October.
re is uncertainty over Mr Musk's plans for the platform's future. Online safety groups and campaigners have expressed concerns about his plans to relax content moderation and reverse permanent Twitter bans given to controversial figures, including former US president Donald Trump.
He also sparked criticism for suggesting that verified Twitter users pay $8 (£7) a month for their blue ticks."	/news/technology-63527336
politics	Will Tory political fortunes prosper under Hunt's plans?	"Jeremy Hunt says tax rises and spending cuts in the Autumn Statement are required to grip inflation and repair the public finances.
It's a contrast to both the Covid-era spending injections under Boris Johnson, and the now-reversed tax-cutting approach of Liz Truss. 
Now the message is: taxes are going up, and public spending squeezes are coming. 
From where I sat in the House of Commons watching the chancellor unfold his plans, Conservative MPs were pretty muted, but generally supportive.
m unlikely to rip the Tory party apart in the way September's mini-budget did. 
But there are some flashpoints ahead. 
With some personal tax thresholds frozen, millions of individuals are set to pay more tax. 
's something which is concerning some Tory MPs, particularly those on the right of the party who previously advocated tax cuts. 
Former business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg has told the BBC he was particularly concerned about tax rises during a recession. 
Fellow Tory MP Esther McVey has said putting taxes up was the ""last thing"" a Tory government should be doing.
Esther McVey says she could not support tax rises while the HS2 rail project continued.
Votes on tax changes and Budgets are usually seen as a de facto ""vote of confidence"" - or test of loyalty - in the government itself. So, we shouldn't overegg the impact some of this unease may have on the government's plans. 
It's unlikely many, if any, Tory MPs would vote against the government's plans as they could risk losing their place in the parliamentary party as a result. 
But some may become more vocal about this.
With cuts to tax-free allowances on things like dividends from shares too, one Tory MP told the BBC they were ""really disturbed"" that ""prudent people who have saved and put money to one side will face additional taxes on their savings and investments"".
re may not be heaps of sympathy among the general public for more top earners having to pay the top rate of tax.
But it's only a few months ago that some Tory MPs wanted to scrap the top rate of tax for the highest earners completely. Politically, not everyone in the party agrees with that decision. 
Labour is trying to draw clear dividing lines between themselves and the Tories on tax too - arguing they would scrap non-dom tax status and not lift the bankers' bonuses cap, or exempt private schools from VAT. 
Conservative think tank Bright Blue also argues the government ""missed an opportunity"" to move more tax from work and on to wealth by taxing profits from selling assets, inheritance and non-dom individuals more. 
Another squeeze that some people in England could start to see is a rise in their council tax bills. Councils in England can now raise council tax up to 5% a year without a vote. 
Some Tory MPs, including Bob Blackman MP, have expressed concern this could make local elections tricky for the party. 
Others in the party have raised concerns that it could be another blow for households struggling with rising prices and taxes. 
ry MP Jonathan Gullis said he was ""sure many local authorities will see this as the government passing the buck"".
""It is a very blunt way to try and raise money for councils across the country, and I fear it won't actually plug the gaps many of them face. ""Councils in areas like Stoke-on-Trent are simply going to need more help from government.""
One former cabinet minister who served under Liz Truss told us they were concerned about the impact these plans would have on the ""squeezed middle"". 
rgely because there will be further targeting of cost of living and energy support towards the most vulnerable.
government argue this is the approach that is ""compassionate"" but responsible.
But the former minister says there are some MPs concerned that some people who do not qualify for extra support because they are a pensioner, on benefits or disabled may still feel a squeeze from rising taxes - and energy bills from April - while prices are still very high. 
One issue bubbling for the Conservatives is on housing. 
Labour are hammering the line ""Tory mortgage premium"" to reference how interest rates have gone up following Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget. 
But one other political issue for the Tories could be the forecast for house prices to fall significantly. 
While this may be welcomed by those looking to buy a home, homeowners with lots of their cash and savings tied up in their house in Tory heartland areas may not be so positive. 
Chancellor has announced extra money for schools, the NHS and social care in England for the next two years.
But spending on public services in England will rise more slowly than planned - with some departments facing cuts after the next election. 
It's not clear yet which departments may be hit the hardest, but ministers will certainly be keen to make sure theirs aren't bearing the biggest brunt nearer the time. The planned increase to defence spending has already been delayed, and the international aid budget that was cut during Covid will also not go back to 0.7% of national income. 
When it was first cut, there was quite a significant Tory MP rebellion. One of the most prominent rebels, Andrew Mitchell, is now a foreign office minister. 
Politically one of the biggest challenges for the Tories just now is their slumping position in the polls: will the government's message of ""sound money"" be enough to get voters to trust them again?
Jeremy Hunt: Sound money has to come before tax cuts
Short of any unforeseen events, the economic blame game will define the next election campaign.
Mr Hunt has conceded that people's disposable incomes are set to fall to record levels.
But he's accused his critics of being detached from reality when they argue this was the Tory government's making.
He argues the opposition cannot claim economic problems are not to do with Covid or the war in Ukraine, but it's much harder for the government to deny that some economic problems - such as high interest rates on people's mortgages - are not in part caused by political decisions that spooked economic markets."	/news/uk-politics-63670675

politics	Local Democracy Reporters excluded from Bristol mayor's briefings	"Local Democracy Reporters (LDRs) have been excluded from formal mayoral briefings in Bristol.
It comes as a video went viral of the head of external communications at Bristol City Council querying a reporter's right to ask a question.
LDR Alex Seabrook had quizzed Bristol mayor Marvin Rees over a 9,200-mile trip to give a talk on climate change.
A council spokesman said it was ""completely false"" to suggest LDRS had been ""barred"".
He added that ""all mainstream local media outlets"" are invited to the briefings but that there had been a ""long-standing mutual agreement"" between the mayor's office and the Bristol Post about personnel attending press conferences.
He explained that whenever they are announced and held ""LDRs would not be sent due to the narrow definition of their role as an impartial service"".
wo Bristol based LDRS reporters have now been told they will not be invited to future press conferences with the mayor.
LDRS is funded by the BBC to provide public service reporting on local authorities. The reporters on the service are based with local newspapers.
xclude LDRs from the fortnightly briefings has led to a boycott of the meetings by other local media - including the BBC, BristolLive and BristolWorld.
Within hours of being posted, the video clip had been viewed more than 250,000 times on Twitter alone, with widespread support for Mr Seabrook and LDRS.
A BBC spokesperson said: ""We are deeply disappointed by the decision taken by the Mayor's Office to not allow the Bristol LDR into his fortnightly press conference. 
""It is an essential ingredient of local democracy that journalists should be able to ask robust, challenging questions to people in power. 
""We have today informed the Mayor that the BBC won't be attending the fortnightly Mayoral briefings until this important issue is resolved.""
During the exchange, Mr Rees insisted he saw ""no irony"" in flying to the TED climate change conference in Vancouver in April.
""The argument was that mayors need to be involved in shaping international policy, so there's no irony because I was there shaping international policy,"" he said.
After Mr Rees spoke, the council's head of external communications Saskia Konynenburg added: ""My question is, Marvin was fully-funded by TED to attend this conference, so I couldn't quite understand what the role as an LDR would be in asking that question. 
""I think it is probably [ok] from a journalist from a newspaper, but I can't quite see the link to LDR.""
uncil's response has done little to abate the furore over both its response and Ms Konynenburg's comments.
Leader of the Conservative Group at Bristol City Council, Mark Weston, said the ""petulant response"" from the mayor's office was ""absolutely outrageous and unacceptable"".
He added: ""The role of the press in our country is to ask awkward and difficult questions of those in power.  
""That is one of the ways politicians are held to account for their decision-making and is used to highlight potential acts of hypocrisy or inconsistency.""
BristolLive and Bristol Post editor Pete Gavan added it was ""vital that the BBC-funded reporters who make up the team locally are able to carry out their remit without interference"".
""Inevitably, we will sometimes ask tough questions or raise issues that politicians might find tricky,"" he said.
""But we believe this is a key function of a free press - and a sign of a healthy democratic landscape.""
Matthew Barraclough, head of the BBC's Local News Partnership, which oversees the public interest scheme, also tweeted his support adding the instance ""makes the case for the Local Democracy Reporting Service in a nutshell"". 
""Without LDRs working hard on behalf of local news media and their audiences, these 'comms bosses' can control the narrative.""

""He's playing (American) football; we're playing basketball. We can't touch him or guard him,"" said Russell. 
Russell and Anthony Edwards each scored 27 points for the Timberwolves.
Williamson was the number one draft pick in 2019, but missed more than a year through injury and was criticised over his weight.

""I watched a lot of old-school players and I tried to figure out their mindsets, and all their mindsets were the same. People remember winners,"" said Williamson.
""So whenever that time comes for me to be done with the game of basketball, I want people to say that he was a winner. And (team-mate) CJ (McCollum) looked at me and said, 'If you wanna be great, this is the time to step up.' And that was all the motivation I needed.""

for NHS England patients was first piloted in 2018.
Among other things, it can be used to make GP appointments, order prescriptions and download NHS Covid passes for international travel.
NHS said 448,000 people had used it to make organ-donation decisions between September 2021 and August 2022.
69% increase on the previous 12 months, which saw 265,000 people registering their decision through the app.
umber of app downloads is now equivalent to more than half the population of England.
Across the UK, more than 6,500 people are waiting for a transplant.
In England, the laws surrounding organ donation were altered, in May 2020, to presume adults consent unless they specifically record a decision to the contrary.
""opt-out"" system was introduced in Wales in 2015 and Scotland in March 2020.
But families still retain the ability to refuse organ donation. 
And the NHS says 605 prevented their dead loved ones donating organs between September 2021 and August 2022.
Only about 1% of people can donate - usually those who die in an intensive care unit or emergency department following brain injuries or cardiac arrest.
Families are much more likely to support donation if there is evidence the person wanted to be a donor.
And people have now used the app to register their wishes more than 3.7 million times. 
Susie Day, NHS Digital Director of Delivery for the NHS App, said: ""Millions of people are continuing to use the NHS app to take control of their healthcare directly from their phone or the NHS website, with over 30 million sign-ups now recorded.

sports	Carlos Sainz: Ferrari driver 'had to reinvent myself' to challenge Charles Leclerc	"Carlos Sainz is talking about reinvention; about reconfiguring his entire approach to driving to try to get on terms with his Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc this year.
28-year-old Spaniard has had a breakthrough season - taking his first pole position and his first win - but the big concern for this thoughtful perfectionist has been that for a long time in 2022 he struggled to meet his own high standards.
""It has been an extremely challenging season for me,"" Sainz says. ""I found a lot of setbacks at the beginning of the year with this new car, with the new regulations, that didn't adapt to my driving style.
""I had to reinvent myself in many ways to try and find the pace.
""I didn't give up. I kept pushing even in the difficult moments, and you can see it paying off now at the end of the season in terms of speed.""
few lines are Sainz in a nutshell - honest, self-critical, humble, determined, hard-working.
It can sound esoteric when a Formula 1 driver talks in this way - of driving style, of struggling with his car. But these things really matter.
Look at Red Bull, where the car was heavy and somewhat ponderous at the beginning of the year. Max Verstappen was unable to exploit his extravagant skills to the point that - early in the season - he was barely quicker than team-mate Sergio Perez. A bit of weight was taken out, and the car came alive for the Dutchman, who suddenly became effectively unbeatable.
Or at McLaren, where Daniel Ricciardo's struggles with the corner-entry characteristics of the car left him so far adrift of Lando Norris the team terminated his contract a year early. A winner of eight grands prix, all but one taken in swashbuckling style with Red Bull, finds himself without a seat on the grid next year.
At Ferrari, Sainz's struggles manifested themselves in Leclerc's overwhelming superiority in the first part of the season. The car has an oversteer balance - where the rear is loose and tends to move and slide - which Leclerc loved but Sainz could not handle as well.
Leclerc out-qualified Sainz in the first eight races in a row, at an average advantage of 0.265 seconds, as the older man struggled with the characteristics of the car.
""I have never been 0.2-0.3secs off any team-mate in F1 and I can never accept that,"" says Sainz, who was actually marginally faster than Verstappen in qualifying when they were team-mates at Toro Rosso at the beginning of their careers, and neck-and-neck with Norris at McLaren in 2019-20.
""I always feel like I am quick in any kind of car, and for the first time in my career I found myself with a very competitive car but one I didn't feel comfortable and natural with.
""I had to challenge myself and open up new roads of set-up and driving style that I wish I didn't have to open, because I wish everything had come a lot more natural and positively.
""But it happened this way, and I stayed disciplined. I tried a lot of things and I made a lot of mistakes trying things. But it was all about trial and error and then coming back and discovering a new path that was a little step forward.""
Gradually, things began to come together for Sainz. He fought for victory with Verstappen in Canada, just losing out, in a race Leclerc started from the back with an engine-related grid penalty.
, at the British Grand Prix, came that first pole, won superbly in the wet, with Leclerc third behind Verstappen.
maiden win also happened that weekend, albeit only after Ferrari had scuppered Leclerc's chances with a strategy error.
And gradually the qualifying battle has shifted. After Silverstone, Sainz out-qualified Leclerc in Hungary, Belgium, the USA and at the last race in Mexico, where Leclerc complained of engine problems. In that period, the average gap between them has been only 0.013secs - still in Leclerc's favour, but so small as to be almost insignificant.
Against a man some regard as perhaps the fastest in F1 over one lap, it is some achievement.
""I'm realistic,"" Sainz says, ""and I know how good Charles is in those conditions. This year he has been driving at a level that is very close to Max or any other driver. And for me he's in a way done a perfect season, apart from the two or three typical mistakes everyone does in a year, or the luck which maybe he has been lacking the same as me.
""I am not proud, because I am not ahead. The day I am ahead in the statistics is the day I will be proud. Until then, I will keep working at it, keep finding lap time in myself.
""But it's a statistic that makes me proud about the progress - not giving up, not letting myself get comfortable with being 0.2secs behind, and always challenging myself to find new ways of driving cars, which is not easy.
""When you see other drivers on the grid, you can see it is difficult to turn around a season, or turn around the feeling with the car. You don't see it very often. The fact I managed to do that makes me happy.""
Sainz says he does not like talking about his strengths as a driver because, when he does, he reads interviews back and regrets it.
""Every time I do an interview and say my positives and I read them, I say: 'Ah, this sounds super-arrogant.' Maybe I go more towards the humble too much and stay in that way - modest. But whenever I see something a bit arrogant, I kill myself for it.
""So I always like to let you guys give your opinion of what you see as my strengths, while I criticise my weaknesses.""
Nevertheless, like all F1 drivers, he spends a lot of time analysing his qualities - good and bad.
When told the qualifying statistics, he said he knew them already. 
""Of course I know,"" he says. But he wouldn't bring it up in an interview unless explicitly asked. He accepts that may not always be to his benefit.
""A lot of people... sometimes they don't perceive my speed,"" Sainz says. ""And I know how fast I am; I just don't like talking about it. I don't give it value, because if I know in myself and my engineers and the people I work with know it, I don't need more people to know it.
""Maybe I am not doing myself any favours, but it is how I am and I am not going to change.""
For all the inner confidence, he recognises, too, that he still has plenty to work on.
Sainz beat Leclerc in Mexico, but the strong trend this year is that Leclerc has been the faster Ferrari driver in races, even in the second half of the season, after Sainz made his progress in qualifying.
Sainz is happy to admit that is an area in which he needs to progress.
""The race execution this year has been a weaker point of mine compared to the past,"" he says. ""This year, we are struggling a lot with tyre management on these new Pirelli tyres.
""The starts with this car, for some reason, have been extremely difficult and we have an inherent problem that doesn't allow us to get off the line as well as in previous years.
""With these tyres, I don't control as well the tyre degradation and the race pace, and it's more difficult to be flexible, and it doesn't open up as many strategy choices as I would like to have or as I had in the past with McLaren.
""These are points I am going to work on in the final races and into next season to be more complete.
""But as you said, the qualifying gap has closed down a lot. I know I'm up against one of the fastest qualifiers - if not the fastest qualifier - on the grid, and so to be so close, it makes me proud to know there has been a lot of effort put into it but also that it's paying off.""
One aspect of race management, though, has certainly been a Sainz strength this year. In a season in which Ferrari's strategy has been exposed - they have made a series of errors that have cost Leclerc big points - Sainz has been a shining light.
On a number of occasions, he has appeared to be running strategy from the cockpit, contradicting his engineers, and forcing them into changing their choices.
One key example was in Monaco, when he rejected their decision to come in for intermediate tyres as the track dried - something that wrecked Leclerc's chances of victory - and instead insisted on staying out, and changing straight to slicks.
It secured him second place between the Red Bulls, while Leclerc following instructions and changing to inters started a series of events that dropped him from the lead to fourth.
Likewise, at Silverstone, after a safety-car period in which Ferrari's decision not to pit Leclerc for fresh tyres led to him dropping from the lead to fourth, Sainz refused - as politely as he could - an order to back up and create a gap to his team-mate to protect him from those behind, on the grounds that doing so would compromise both their races. 
ry, as he passed Leclerc, who then fought valiantly on his old tyres to delay Perez and Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes.
Sainz says the ability to read the race from the car is both natural and something he actively tries to develop.
""I am relatively cold-blooded in many aspects of life,"" he says. ""Sometimes maybe too much. And I don't show maybe my tension, passion. But it is also something I work on. 
""Having a good fitness level always allows you to have more brain space when you are driving. Having good confidence with the car and yourself helps you to have more brain space to think about what's going on in the race.
""And I feel like I always have a clear mind when racing and I can identify the opportunities and the chances to know what is right or wrong from the inside of the cockpit that sometimes is the biggest challenge.
""I know it's one of my strengths and I try to exploit it whenever I have a chance.""
For Ferrari as a whole, the season has been a rollercoaster. 
re is considerable satisfaction that they finally managed to return to competitiveness, and that Leclerc was able to go toe-to-toe with Verstappen for the championship for a while.
r's outright speed is evident from the fact no-one will be able to match Leclerc's score of nine pole positions, regardless of what happens in the final two races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi.
But there is also an acknowledgement that mistakes and reliability problems torpedoed their chances, questions as to why the car is rarely as effective in races as in qualifying, and concern they have fallen behind in the development race, just as they did the last time they had a competitive car in 2017 and 2018.
""There are definitely some mixed feelings in the team,"" Sainz says. ""We are super-proud of the progress we have done with the car to get back to where we are. But this has also been a year of realisation that there are still areas to work on and improve.
""We are being super-disciplined and super-coherent and ultra-critical behind closed doors as to which areas we need to improve to match our competitors in certain areas, or be better than them, which has to be the target.
""The team is taking note of everything and we are going to try and take another step next year. Will it be enough? I don't know. But it's definitely a target.""
In the past, a year such as this might have led to heads rolling at Ferrari. But Sainz says team principal Mattia Binotto has stuck to the no-blame culture he is determined to engender, after its success at Mercedes and Red Bull.
""It's incredibly difficult to execute and especially in a team like Ferrari, where there is so much pressure and so much attention on us, and everyone wants changes immediately as soon as something is wrong,"" Sainz says.
""Mattia has done an excellent job at not losing the cool head at any point. We have had a lot of difficult moments, a lot of criticism, and he has remained stuck to his principles.
""No-one has been fired. We stayed united in the most difficult moments and it shows the progress of our culture.
""It is always exposed to criticism and high attention on all our mistakes. When we win, it's incredible - it is the best win in the world to win for Ferrari.
""To go through such a difficult season as we did with so few problems in the team is something to be valued."""	/sport/formula1/63498883
technology	Ukraine round-up: Using drones in the war and new concern over nuclear power plant	"Watch: The BBC joins drone pilots under fire as they locate Russian targets
Kherson was the first major city in Ukraine to fall into the hands of Russian forces after the invasion began just under six months ago - but now, it's the one the Ukrainians have hopes of retaking.
Since last month, Ukraine and its allies have been saying the counter-offensive in the Kherson region is gaining momentum, with Maj Gen Dmytro Marchenko telling the BBC Ukrainian forces aim to recapture the city - strategically located to the west of the Dnipro river - within weeks. 
But if they do, it looks unlikely to be through a traditional full-scale attack: instead, small drone units could be playing a significant role.
BBC has met one of the drone pilots aiming to do just that - and he's using the call-sign Maverick, the name of Tom Cruise's character in the film Top Gun.
Antonio Guterres, United Nations secretary general, has been in the Ukrainian city of Lviv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
UN and Turkey brokered a landmark deal that earlier this month saw grain exports resume from Ukraine's ports for the first time in months.
f grain had been trapped because of Russian blockades, leading to shortages and higher food prices in other parts of the world. Before the war, Ukraine was one of the world's key agricultural producers.
Not surprisingly, the leaders discussed the scheme, with Mr Zelenksy later saying they would not only continue with the initiative, but also discussed ""the possible directions of its development"". 
Mr Guterres plans to visit the Black Sea port of Odesa - from where the grain shipments have resumed - on Friday.
ree leaders also discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, around which heavy shelling has been taking place for weeks. Ukraine and Russia have each been blaming each other.
- the largest in Europe - has been under the control of Russian forces since March, but has continued to function - although  some staff working there have told the BBC they are ""being kept at gunpoint"".. 
Russians have been urged to hand control back over fears of what could happen if fighting in the area continues.
Mr Zelensky has described the ongoing stand-off as ""Russia's nuclear blackmail"" and urged the UN to ensure the plant's security and liberation. ""This deliberate terror on the part of the aggressor can have global catastrophic consequences for the whole world,"" the president wrote on messaging service Telegram.
Mr Guterres, speaking on Thursday, said the plant should be demilitarised and re-established as ""purely civilian"". 
But those demands have already been rejected by Moscow. A spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry, Ivan Nechayev, described Guterres's proposal as unacceptable, claiming it would make the facility ""more vulnerable"".
""That is the very reason that the proposals are unacceptable,"" he said.
As deliberations continue over Zaporizhzhia's future, Ukraine is preparing for the worst.
BBC's James Waterhouse visited a supermarket car park close to the site of the power plant which had been transformed into a training ground.
""Emergency workers are dressed in yellow hazmat suits,"" our correspondent says. ""They are practising cleaning drills in the event of a radioactive contamination.
""They are watched by senior officials, who are keen to see how ready the region would be in the event of a worst-case scenario.""

technology	Damaged cable leaves Shetland cut off from mainland	"Communications to Shetland have been severely disrupted after a subsea cable was damaged.
Police have declared a major incident after the south subsea cable between the islands and the mainland was cut.
force said some landlines and mobiles were not usable and that officers were patrolling to try to reassure residents.
Repairs to another cable connecting Shetland and Faroe are ongoing after it was damaged last week. 
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was an emergency situation for the island.
Scottish government's resilience committee had met and was working with partner agencies to ensure support was provided, she added.
She said the assumption was the damage was accidental, adding: ""There is nothing to suggest otherwise, but work is continuing to assess exactly what the cause of the problem has been.""
MP for Orkney and Shetlands Alastair Carmichael told the BBC he had raised the issue with the UK government, but understood it could be days before communications were restored.
He said the priority was fixing the issue but that resilience would also need to be looked at in future.
Homes and businesses are affected across the isles, which are 130 miles (210 km) from the Scottish mainland and have a population of about 23,000.
BBC has heard reports that many shops are unable to take card payments.
Meanwhile Highlands and Islands Airports told the BBC that Sumburgh Airport was ""operating as normal"", but would advise passengers to contact Loganair for further updates.
Serco NorthLink Ferries confirmed they did not anticipate the problem would have any impact on sailings.
A BT Group spokesperson said: ""Due to a break in a third-party subsea cable connecting Shetland with the Scottish mainland, some phone, broadband and mobile services are affected.
""Engineers are working to divert services via other routes as soon as possible and we'll provide further updates. Our external subsea provider is also looking to restore their link quickly. 
""Anyone who needs to call 999 should try their landline or their mobile, even if they don't have signal from their own mobile provider. We're sorry for any inconvenience.""
Emergency services have had to implement temporary back-up arrangements.
Police Scotland said it was working with partners including the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and HM Coastguard to bring additional emergency support to the island.
force said an emergency hub had been set up in the Tesco car park in South Road, Lerwick.
Ch Insp Jane Mackenzie told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that police officers would be more visible on the island in the meantime.
She said: ""We're still trying to work to establish the full extent of the problem - we know there are some telephone lines working, 999 lines are believed to be working and some mobile networks are still working.
""So anyone calling 999 should be able to do so from a mobile phone. What we would ask is if you have an emergency you should first try a landline or mobile to call 999. 
""If that doesn't work, you should flag down an emergency service vehicle that isn't using their blue light or attend either a police station, hospital, fire or ambulance station to report the emergency.""
Ch Insp Mackenzie urged the public not to use phone lines for non-urgent calls and to check on elderly or vulnerable people more frequently as assistance alarms may not be operating effectively.
was damaged between Faroe and Shetland last week will be repaired on Saturday, according to Faroese Telecom's head of infrastructure Páll Vesturbú.
He said: ""The damage is affecting most of telecom services to Shetland. There are some services still working but we will try to establish more services during the day if that's possible. 
""We expect it will be fishing vessels that damaged the cable but it is very rare that we have two problems at the same time.""
MP Alistair Carmichael added that the damage had caused ""catastrophic impact"".
He said: ""Communication is critical to modern life, to business, to the emergency services and education - just about every aspect of modern life. 
""It's like somebody has flipped a switch and taken us back 20 or 30 years. You live in an island community, you know sometimes these things happen and that's why we have to learn the lessons from this.""
Modern submarine cables use fibre optic technology and are typically as wide as a garden hose, according to telecoms market research firm TeleGeography.
It explains lasers on one end fire at extremely rapid rates down thin glass fibres to receptors at the other end of the cable. 
glass fibres are wrapped in layers of plastic - and sometimes steel wire - for protection. 
Cables lie on the ocean floor, while nearer to the shore they are buried under the seabed for additional protection.
firm said ""considerable care"" is taken to make sure cables avoid fault zones, fishing zones, anchoring areas and other dangers.
Ian Brown, a partner with Lerwick-based internet provider Shetland Broadband, said he became aware of a problem just after 00:00 on Thursday when his home broadband went off.
He said the north cable was broken on 15 October in a clean break, but the southern one was not a clean break because there are around 100 fibres in the cable - and not all had been broken. 
Shetland Broadband is still operational because the fibres it uses were not damaged.
Mr Brown said the impact ranged from minor inconvenience for islanders to disruption to businesses and local NHS services that rely on their online connection.
He said Shetland Broadband was working with the NHS to try and resolve its issues.
In another example, he said a delivery of 2,000 parcels to the islands encountered problems as they could not be scanned.
Mr Brown said: ""We don't know if the cable was hooked up by a ship or lifted and caught by the currents. It is a very rare event, a bit like storm damage."""	/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-63326102
entertainment	RSPB lodges Natural World Heritage site bid for wetlands area	"An application has been submitted for wetlands along the east coast of Britain to become a Natural World Heritage site. 
, submitted by the RSPB, includes the Humber estuary, Lincolnshire, through Suffolk, Norfolk, Essex, to The Thames in Kent.
rity said a wide range of species use it as ""an essential home and refuge"" during migration journeys.
It has been submitted to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. 
A decision on whether it will be added to the UK's Tentative List of World Heritage sites is expected early next year.
A report, by marine and coastal habitat consultants ABPmer, found the east coast had ""outstanding universal value"" due its world class network of coastal wetlands which support globally important migratory bird populations, the RSPB said.  
One billion birds are reliant on the area, which covers 420,079 acres (170,000 hectares), each winter to shelter from the harsh conditions in Scandinavia, Canada, Greenland and Siberia. 
relines include a ""a rich buffet of invertebrates"" for birds to feed on, and its marshes are places to fish and for tourists to visit, the report said.
Adam Rowlands, RSPB England area manager for Suffolk, said: ""In Suffolk the coastal estuaries will be welcoming large numbers of dark-bellied brent geese, avocet, black-tailed godwit and knot for the winter, whilst coastal marshes will ring to the whistling cries of wigeon, rubbing shoulders with beautiful pintail and white-fronted geese."" 
Russell Leavett, a volunteer at the Stour Estuary reserve, in Suffolk, said it would be ""incredible"" to gain heritage site the recognition. 
""I've experienced some of the most amazing natural spectacles as a volunteer - from the arrival of avocets in recent years to getting to know a long-established group of mute swans at Manningtree.""
UK has two Natural World Heritage sites - Dorset and East Devon Coast and the Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast, in Northern Ireland.
If successful, the east coast could join some of the world's most iconic sites including the Great Barrier Reef, the Galapagos Islands and Mount Kilimanjaro, the RSPB said.

business	HSBC climate change adverts banned by UK watchdog	"UK's advertising regulator has banned two HSBC advertisements for being ""misleading"" about the company's work to tackle climate change.
Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the banking giant can no longer run the ads which promoted its plans to reduce harmful emissions.
watchdog said that the posters ""omitted material information"" about HSBC's activities.
It marks the ASA's first action against a bank for so-called ""greenwashing"".
An HSBC spokesperson told the BBC that ""The financial sector has a responsibility to communicate its role in the low carbon transition to raise public awareness and engage its customers.""
""We will consider how best to do this as we deliver our ambitious net zero commitments,"" they added.
Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those goods or services.
rts were seen at bus stops in London and Bristol last October, in the lead up to the highly-anticipated United Nations COP26 climate change summit.
rs outlined HSBC's efforts to plant trees and help its customers achieve ""net zero"" emissions. Net zero means not adding to greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere by cutting and trying to balance out emissions.
One poster showed an image of waves crashing on a shore with text that said ""Climate change doesn't do borders. Neither do rising sea levels. That's why HSBC is aiming to provide up to $1 trillion in financing and investment globally to help our clients transition to net zero"".
r advert was of tree growth rings and text which read ""Climate changes doesn't do borders. So in the UK, we're helping to plant 2 million trees which will lock in 1.25 million tonnes of carbon over their lifetime"".
ASA upheld complaints that the ads ""omitted significant information about HSBC's contribution to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.""
""Customers... would not expect that HSBC, in making unqualified claims about its environmentally beneficial work, would also be simultaneously involved in the financing of businesses which made significant contributions to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions,"" the regulator added.
HSBC's efforts to address climate change have come under scrutiny in recent months. 
In February, campaigners accused big banks, including HSBC, of pumping billions of dollars into new oil and gas production despite being part of a green banking group.
London-based ShareAction called on the banks to demand green plans from fossil fuel firms before funding them.
ShareAction said that 24 big banks, which joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance last year, had since provided $33bn (£29.1bn) for new oil and gas project. 
At the time, a HSBC spokesman said the bank was ""committed to working with our customers to achieve a transition towards a thriving low carbon economy"".
Meanwhile, a senior HSBC executive drew controversy in May when he accused central bankers and other officials of exaggerating the risks of climate change.
Stuart Kirk, who was the global head of responsible investing at the bank's asset management division, said: ""There's always some nut job telling me about the end of the world.""
His role, which was based in London, involved considering the impact of investments on environmental, social and governance issues.
In July, Mr Kirk resigned from the bank and said that his comments had made his position ""unsustainable"".

technology	UK set to have world's biggest automated drone superhighway	"UK is set to become home to the world's largest automated drone superhighway within the next two years.
rones will be used on the 164-mile Skyway project connecting towns and cities, including Cambridge and Rugby.
It is part of a £273m funding package for the aerospace sector which will be revealed by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng on Monday.
Other projects include drones delivering mail to the Isles of Scilly and medication across Scotland.
Mr Kwarteng is to announce the news at the Farnborough International Airshow - the first to be held since 2019.
He will say the funding will ""help the sector seize on the enormous opportunities for growth that exist as the world transitions to cleaner forms of flight"".
Dave Pankhurst, director of drones at BT, told the BBC that Skyway is about scaling up trials that have been taking place around the UK.
BT is one of the partners involved in the collaboration.
""This drone capability has existed for quite some time, but is in its infancy in terms of being actually part of our society and being a usable application,"" he said. 
""So for us, this is about taking a significant step towards that point. It's going to open up so many opportunities.""
Skyway aims to connect the airspace above Reading, Oxford, Milton Keynes, Cambridge, Coventry and Rugby by mid-2024, and will receive more than £12m.
A total of £105.5m of the government's funding will be specifically for projects relating to ""integrated aviation systems and new vehicle technologies"", including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones.
rojects include a plan to use drones to provide regular deliveries of mail and medicine to the Isles of Scilly, and to distribute medicines across Scotland, potentially enabling some cancer patients to be treated in their local community.
Chris Forster, chief operating officer of aviation technology company Altitude Angel, said there were a lot of potential uses for the superhighway.
""Whether it be a business doing logistics, all the way to the police and medical deliveries of vaccines and blood samples, there's a real demand to have access to this airspace,"" he said. 
""We've done a few projects in Africa where the road infrastructure was not good for ground vehicles, and the delivery of vaccines was provided by automated drones.""
gy utilises ground-based sensors installed along the highway which provide a real-time view of where drones are in the airspace.
raffic management system - a sort of air traffic control for drones - which guides them along their routes and avoids collisions.
Steve Wright, associate professor in aerospace engineering at UWE Bristol, said the biggest concern regarding crashes does not come when the drone is in the air, but during take-off or landing.
""It's about the first and last bit of the flight,"" he said. ""The problem is what happens when you're 10 feet away from people. That's the bit I spend my time worrying about. 
""When it's up in the air I know it's stable and it's not going to hit something. 
""People are looking at lowering packages down from the air - in other words you keep the drone well away from people. There's lots of very bright people out there working on flight plans that deliberately avoid built-up areas.""
Mr Pankhurst said the project was working alongside the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to ensure safety. 
""The way they work as an organisation is very evidence-based,"" he said. ""Safety is just paramount in this industry, but importantly, nothing happens without the regulator actually signing it off. 
""The CAA is part of all of these future flight projects. It is part of all of these activities, validating the progress and making sure they're safe.""
He said its research showed that people are more likely to accept a drone if they know it is providing an important service.
Simon Jude, senior lecturer at Cranfield University, said: ""People's knowledge and attitudes might change if they know what that UAV is being used for. If it's an emergency medical support, you're probably going to be a lot more accepting of the noise. 
""So what happens if you get multiple UAVs, or an agricultural use where you might get a number of drones collecting and saving data all at once?

Hove Park School in Hove, a joint statement from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and Brighton & Hove City Council said. 
As of Thursday, 15 UK children had died after invasive strep A infections since September.
f the pupil in Brighton with suspected strep A brings that number to 16.
Most strep A infections are mild, but more severe invasive cases - while still rare - are rising.
Public health officials in Brighton and Hove said they were working with the school to raise awareness among parents about the signs of strep A infections and what to do if a child develops them.
ge and gender of the child have not been disclosed.
Dr Rachael Hornigold, consultant in health protection at UKHSA South East, said: ""We are extremely saddened to hear about the death of a young child, and our thoughts are with their family, friends and the local community.""
Alistair Hill, director of Public Health at Brighton & Hove City Council, said: ""We are working with the UK Health Security Agency and Hove Park School following the death of a pupil who attended the school. 
""We offer our heartfelt condolences to the family, friends, and the whole school community who will all be deeply affected by the very tragic loss of this young child, and we are providing our support to them at this incredibly sad time.""
Normally, mild strep A infections cause symptoms like a sore throat or skin infections.
ug can also cause scarlet fever - with a sore throat, skin rash that feels like sandpaper, a high temperature and a so-called ""strawberry tongue"".
It is treated with antibiotics which may also help reduce the risk of complications and spread of the bug.

Data as of Thursday from the UKHSA showed 13 children aged under 15 had died in England since September.
wo other deaths of children had been recorded in Belfast and Wales, taking the UK total to 15 at that point.
Mr Hill said that contracting strep A from another person was ""very rare"" and most people who come into contact with strep A infections ""remain well and symptom-free - and therefore there is no reason for children to be kept home if well"".

sports	Courtney Tulloch: World medallist predicts Team GB will 'smash it' at Paris 2024	"World gymnastics bronze medallist Courtney Tulloch has predicted that Team GB will ""absolutely smash it"" at the Paris Olympics in 2024.
finished fourth in the medal table with six podiums at the recent World Championships in Liverpool.
ulloch, 27, claimed the first medal in the rings by a British gymnast after earlier taking a team-event bronze.
French capital is set to stage the Olympics for the third time, 100 years on from last doing so in 1924.
And the British men and women's gymnastics teams have already qualified to compete.
""It takes a lot of pressure off, so now we can start building and focusing on what we want to do in Paris, whether it's the routines, the team selection,"" Tulloch told BBC Essex. 
""I think if we carry on the way we are, we're going to absolutely smash it out in Paris. We've got a lot of work to do before then but it's looking really good.""
He continued: ""For us, it's just amazing that so many people are watching our sport on TV, supporting and getting behind us. We've come such a long way in such a small amount of time and we just want as many eyeballs on our sport as possible.""
ulloch's medals in Liverpool capped a highly successful year which saw him retain his Commonwealth rings title as well as collecting team golds in Birmingham and at the European Championships in Munich - the latter despite a nut allergy reaction the previous night.
""We started off pretty slow in that team final and we had a few mistakes on pommel but for us to come together as a collective, put that behind us and finish with a bronze was just incredible,"" said Tulloch, who first took up the sport aged six and trains in Basildon.
""I was heartbroken watching it because teams don't normally come back from being eighth. The scores on pommel were very low and I hadn't even competed yet.
""But I knew if I went [well] on rings, and that we're a very strong team on vault and parallel bar, so if we could score well on those apparatus we could bring ourselves back.
""It wasn't a time for talking and chatting, it was a time to show our personality and show the hard work we'd been putting in in the gym on the apparatus.""   
Great Britain could have three-time Olympic gold medallist Max Whitlock, a pommel horse specialist, back in the squad for Paris following an extended break from the sport.
""He's looking in incredible shape. It will be a massive lift [to have him back] because he's such a calm, cool character and it's good to have someone like that in the team,"" Tulloch added.
""He's so experienced at the same time so you can go to him for anything. It will just lift everyone's game and it's a real positive to have him in there."""	/sport/gymnastics/63582417
sports	Jost Capito: Williams chief executive to leave after two years in charge	"Chief executive officer and team principal Jost Capito is to leave Williams after two years in charge.
64-year-old former car industry executive joined the team in December 2020, months after it was bought by investment group Dorilton Capital.
Frenchman Francois-Xavier Demaison, who was brought in as Williams' technical director by Capito in early 2021, is also leaving his job.
No reason for Capito's sudden departure was given by Williams.
Dorilton Capital chairman Matthew Savage said in a statement: ""We would like to thank Jost for his hard work and dedication as we embarked on a major transformation process to begin the journey of reviving Williams Racing. 
""We're grateful that Jost postponed his planned retirement to take on this challenge and now he will pass the reins on for the next part of this staged process.""
Capito said in the same statement: ""It has been a huge privilege to lead Williams Racing for the last two seasons and to lay the foundations for the turnaround of this great team.""
Dorilton bought Williams from the family of the team's late founder Sir Frank Williams in the summer of 2020, with the aim of returning them to competitiveness after a slump in form.
It recruited Capito from the Volkswagen Group at the end of a 2020 season in which the team finished last in the championship for the third consecutive year.
m improved in 2021, to finish eighth, their best result since 2017.
was thanks in large part to George Russell's stunning performance at the Belgian Grand Prix, when he qualified the Williams second in wet weather. He was classified in the same place in the race, which was called off without any racing laps taking place because of poor weather.
Russell and Nicholas Latifi also took four other points finishes in 2021, finishing the season with 23 points and ahead of Alfa Romeo and Haas.
Williams were unable to keep up that momentum into 2022, which saw F1 introduce a major set of rule changes aimed at making the racing closer and bringing the field closer together.
r car was the slowest in the field and although British-born Thai Alex Albon impressed as Russell's replacement, Williams slumped to last place again, with only eight points.
On raw qualifying pace, the Williams was more than 0.3 seconds a lap on average slower than the next slowest car over the 2022 season.
Dorilton is said by a source close to the team to have decided in the summer not to renew Capito's contract and to look elsewhere for a team principal.
utfit now also need to source a new technical director to lead their design group.
Albon signed a new two-year contract for 2023 and 2024 and he has been joined at the team for 2023 by American Logan Sargent.
Capito revived Albon's career by choosing to give him a seat at Williams after he had been demoted to reserve driver by Red Bull after two seasons with their teams.
Albon paid tribute to Capito following news of his former boss's departure, writing on Twitter: ""We only had one year working together but in that time you were not just a team principal but also a great friend. Thank you Jost for your faith in me this year and all the support that that came with."""	/sport/formula1/63950370

politics	Single-use plastics: Welsh ban 'may not be fully enforced until 2026'	"Parts of a new Welsh law banning some single-use plastics may not be in full effect until 2026, a senior Senedd member has said.
Welsh Parliament passed a law banning a range of items last week.
Some of them will be banned in autumn 2023 but other items - including on carrier bags - will be outlawed later to allow firms to use up stock.
Welsh government has not given a date but Labour's Huw Irranca Davies suggested a delay until 2026.
It comes amid questions over whether the ban on bags needs UK government permission to be fully enforced.
use of a post-Brexit law that regulates how trade works between the UK's nations.
Senedd's own research has questioned whether the ban is fully enforceable without an ""exclusion"" from the UK government.
Welsh government insists the ban is fully enforceable despite the post-Brexit law, and has said it may be a test case for how the new framework, called the Internal Market Act (IMA), affects how the Welsh Parliament works. 
Last week the Welsh Parliament passed a law banning a long list of plastic goods - including plates, cutlery, drinks stirrers, drinking straws and polystyrene cups.
w also bans polystyrene takeaway food containers, plastic stemmed cotton buds and balloon sticks.
Wales was the last country in Great Britain to act on single use plastic, with England having banned stirrers, buds and straws and Scotland going further on sticks, cutlery, plates and polystyrene containers.
However the Welsh ban goes even further than both countries, prohibiting the supply of single-use carrier bags and oxo-degradable products.
Huw Irranca-Davies - a Labour Senedd member who is chair of the legislative committee of the Senedd - said that while the Welsh government said ""the earliest some provisions can be commenced is autumn 2023, they have also explained that some provisions may be delayed until 2026 to ensure appropriate consultation and engagement"".
Welsh government said after regulations are brought in there will be bans from autumn 2023 on single-use plastic plates, cutlery, drink stirrers, plastic-stemmed cotton buds, balloon sticks and cups and takeaway food containers made of foamed polystyrene.
Bans for polystyrene lids for take-away cups and fast-food containers, plastic single use carrier bags and products made of oxo-degradable plastic will come into force at ""a later stage to will allow more time for businesses to source alternative products and use up existing stock"", it added.
According to Senedd research, the IMA has added uncertainty to whether the Welsh government can introduce effective bans on products permitted to be sold in other parts of the UK.
IMA means that goods that can be sold in one nation of the UK should be able to be sold in another, despite what the law in the latter nation may say.
Welsh ministers had objected to the law because of the impact on the powers of the Senedd.
ried to get a court to accept their view that the way the IMA was written should not reduce the Welsh Parliament's powers.
Devolved governments can request an ""exclusion"" and most single-use plastics in the Welsh law are excluded from the IMA's rules, because of a request from the Scottish government earlier in 2022.
But two are not - single-use carrier bags, and what are known as oxo-degradable products.
Without the permission for the ban, the Senedd's research department suggests that a prohibition on single-use bags made in Wales would mean producers of bags in other UK nations would ""retain an automatic right to sell these types of bags in Wales, or to supply them to Welsh businesses"".
In a report published earlier this year the Senedd legislative committee said there was ""a danger that people and businesses affected in Wales are not being provided with accurate information about the effect of this legislation"". 
""This could result in individuals and businesses being unaware of, or misled about, the full extent of the law as it applies in Wales,"" the report said.
BBC Wales was told by a UK government source that the Welsh government has not requested its own exclusion.
w was put through the Welsh parliament quicker than laws normally are. The Welsh government said it did not want to ""fall behind other countries in the UK"".
But it also gave the reason that the law could be used in its own legal action against the Internal Market Act, after it was told it needed an example of a law for the Welsh government's arguments to be considered.
Senedd committee argued that the IMA ""could have been explored in greater depth"" had the bill not been processed as fast as it was.
Huw Irranca-Davies said the Senedd legislative committee was ""not satisfied"" the Welsh government had clarified its position on the Internal Market Act.
He added: ""The justifications used by ministers - and indeed the first minister - for seeking to fast-track the scrutiny of this bill seemed to evolve over time and under scrutiny, and sometimes became contradictory. That is not acceptable.""
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""This Bill is well within the Senedd's competence and is fully enforceable and effective and [the IMA] cannot and does not cut across that devolved competence. 
""We believe we have made this position clear and will continue to communicate this message with business and other interested parties over the coming months.
""The bill's timetable, while shorter in duration, allowed all the necessary steps for scrutiny to be completed. 
""Following its passing in the Senedd, it will now enter the usual 4-week intimation period, during which either the counsel general or the attorney general may decide to refer it to the Supreme Court for a decision on legislative competence."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63880012
technology	Meta ordered to sell Giphy by UK's competition watchdog CMA	"UK's competition watchdog has reissued an order to Meta to sell animated images platform Giphy.
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said this ruling was final, after going back and forth with the tech giant since its decision was first announced last year. 
CMA found that the takeover of the gif-creation website could harm social media users and advertising.
A Meta spokesperson said it accepted the decision but was ""disappointed"".
ruling is the first time the UK has blocked an acquisition by a tech giant, signalling a new determination to scrutinise digital deals.
Meta had bought Giphy - the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks such as Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter - in 2020.
CMA investigated the sale and published its original decision in November 2021, ordering Meta to dispose of Giphy.
Meta, then called Facebook Inc, had been fined a record £50.5m for refusing to comply with the CMA during the investigation.
Meta had hoped its purchase of Giphy would improve finding gifs and stickers on its social networks Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook.
While Meta maintained that Giphy would be ""openly available"" to other social networks, the CMA's investigation found the buyout would harm competition in social media and advertising. 
Meta appealed against this decision, but in July the Competition Appeal Tribunal found in the CMA's favour on all but one ground, which was related to third-party confidential information. 
After that finding, the CMA said it reviewed its original decision that Meta would have to sell Giphy and was standing by it.
It said it was concerned the deal would not only limit choice for those on social media but it would also reduce innovation in digital display advertising in the UK.
Stuart McIntosh, chair of the independent inquiry group carrying out the CMA's investigation, said there was no other option but for Meta to sell Giphy. 
""This deal would significantly reduce competition in two markets,"" he said.
""It has already resulted in the removal of a potential challenger in the UK display ad market, while also giving Meta the ability to further increase its substantial market power in social media.""
In a statement, the social network said it accepted the decision, adding: ""We are grateful to the Giphy team during this uncertain time for their business, and wish them every success. 
""We will continue to evaluate opportunities - including through acquisition - to bring innovation and choice to more people in the UK and around the world.""
Paul Stone, from law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, told the BBC: ""The significance of the CMA's decision is that it underscores the body's concerns about the impact of the deal on future innovation in digital advertising.
""This seems to be key to the CMA's approach to regulating big tech in the UK, where preserving competition from small but potentially significant future challengers can be at least as important as maintaining competition between already established players in the sector."""	/news/technology-63302179

politics	New UK prime minister: What comes next for Rishi Sunak?	"Rishi Sunak will establish a series of firsts when he becomes prime minister - including becoming the first British Asian person to hold the office, and being the first prime minister appointed by King Charles III. But much of the process of the next few days will follow choreography set by decades of tradition.
So what happens now and what can he expect when he does formally become prime minister? 
Liz Truss will hold her final Cabinet meeting at 09:00 BST on Tuesday. As Rishi Sunak is not currently in the Cabinet, he will not be present.
Like many a departing prime minister, she will then deliver a final speech outside 10 Downing Street at about 10:15. 
Ms Truss will then be driven to Buckingham Palace to offer her resignation to the King.
means Ms Truss will miss out on her chance of a goodbye in the House of Commons, as she announced her departure after last week's Prime Minister's Questions, but is being replaced before this week's takes place at noon on Wednesday.
In the past that has provided an opportunity for a standing ovation or a tearful farewell from supporters. Last month it gave Boris Johnson the chance to tell the Commons ""Hasta la vista, baby"". 
Once Ms Truss has departed the scene - and the UK is temporarily without a prime minister - Mr Sunak, as leader of the largest party in the Commons, will be invited to Buckingham Palace by the King. 
King will ask Mr Sunak if he believes he can form a new government, before the politician is  appointed through a tradition called ""kissing hands"". 
In his autobiography, Tony Blair - who was operating on only one hour's sleep following his election victory - admitted to being a bit confused when a royal official told him: ""You don't actually kiss the Queen's hands in the ceremony of kissing hands. You brush them gently with your lips.""
Having been formally appointed as prime minister, the new leader will head to 10 Downing Street - his new workplace and (usually) his new home - although in the past, Tony Blair swapped with the living quarters above No 11 to accommodate his family more comfortably.
Here, at about 11:35, Mr Sunak will make his first prime ministerial speech with the aim of explaining what he wants to do in government.
Margaret Thatcher promised to bring ""harmony... where there is discord"", Gordon Brown vowed to ""try his utmost"", Theresa May spoke of tackling ""burning injustices"" in society, while Boris Johnson warned that ""the doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters"" would ""lose their shirts"".
re for the speech to be outside No 10 - but becoming prime minister in October means there is a persistent risk of rain, so Mr Sunak's team might be anxiously checking the weather.
w prime minister will then enter through the famous black door to be greeted by Downing Street staff, who traditionally line up to applaud their new boss. Usually it is all smiles, but not always.
When he arrived, Mr Blair noticed one of the secretaries was in tears. Lord Robin Butler - the most senior civil servant at the time - recalls that Mr Blair asked if she was OK. ""Well, Mr Blair, you are welcome,"" she replied ""but I did so like that nice Mr Major [Mr Blair's predecessor].""
re is not much time for anxious introspection as a prime minister must immediately begin appointing senior ministers, some of whom can prove to be surprisingly elusive, just at the moment the party leader wants to sound them out about accepting a promotion.
Dealing with angry or even eager colleagues is to be expected for a prime minister on their first day. Mr Sunak has yet to set out how he plans to bring together a party riven into factions that have driven out two prime ministers in three months. 
Civil servants -  government workers who are not politically appointed so do not change with a new prime minister - will have been monitoring the candidates' various policy pronouncements throughout the leadership campaign and preparing advice.
Mr Sunak has not publicly updated his policy platform since the summer, when he last ran for leader. Since then the economic picture has changed. 
Government borrowing costs have increased following weeks of market turmoil set off by Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget. 
On his first day in the job, Mr Sunak will be presented with briefs from civil servants setting out how his policy plans can be put into action. 
""It is a very big pile of paper,"" says Lord Robin Butler, who led the civil service under Ms Thatcher, John Major and Mr Blair.
""You want them [the new prime minister] to feel that everything has been thought of.""
At some point during his first few days, the prime minister will have to do something that will put everything else into perspective.
He will sit down and write letters to the four commanders of the UK Trident submarines with instructions about whether he should retaliate in the event the UK suffers a nuclear attack. The letters are stored in a safe on board the submarines, and only opened if contact with the UK is lost. 
James Callaghan - prime minister from 1976-1979 - is the only former leader to reveal what he would have done in the event of a nuclear attack.
""If we had got to that point where it was, I felt, necessary to do it - then I would have done it,"" he told a BBC documentary in 1988. ""I've had terrible doubts of course about this. And I say to you that if I had lived after having pressed that button, I would never, never have forgiven myself.""
In 2013, political historian Lord Peter Hennessy told BBC Radio Four: ""This is the moment they know what being prime minister is all about - no other job can prepare you for this."" 
first days of the prime minister's term are normally filled with phone calls from foreign dignitaries.
President Biden is looking forward to speaking with Mr Sunak in the coming days, the White House Press Secretary said. But they added that it was ""protocol for the president to wait until after an incoming British prime minister has met with the monarch and been invited to form a new government to offer his congratulations"".
gratulations have already started rolling in, though. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted ""Special Diwali wishes"" to Mr Sunak and ""the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership""."	/news/uk-politics-62596329
health	East of England Ambulance Service: 'If we are queuing, we can't get to patients'	"Paramedics describe a health service in crisis with a lack of investment and increasing demand, of lengthy waits to transfer patients to hospitals and of a social care system facing collapse. So what does a typical ambulance shift look like?
rea covered by the East of England Ambulance Service's nearly 400 front-line ambulances is vast.
It is responsible for more than six million people over a 7,500 sq mile (19,424 sq km) area, which includes Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk.
BBC joined one of the service's ambulance crews for a 12-hour shift, to see the work they do and to hear their concerns about the current state of the health service at large.
first call-out received by the Gorleston-based crew in Norfolk is for a patient in cardiac arrest. 
However, after putting on the blue lights, the crew is stood down and later diverted down to Oulton Broad in Suffolk to check on 82-year-old Pat Clarke. 
Ambulance call outs are categorised into four levels of seriousness, from Category 1, involving life threatening conditions, to Category 4, which is a non-urgent problem that requires transportation to a hospital or clinic.
Category 2 call-out, which means it is a serious condition such as a stroke or chest pain.
rew arrives within 30 minutes of the call coming in.
Ms Clarke has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and breast cancer. Her carer, Chloe Tiborcz, was concerned about Ms Clarke so dialled 111.
""I came in this morning and Pat was very breathless and had a cough as well, so I called the ambulance,"" Ms Tiborcz says. ""They came pretty quickly - within half an hour.
""It is very reassuring - I had a lady who had to wait eight hours pretty recently.""
ramedic crew says Ms Clarke could have been dealt with by a visit from her GP. But with GPs sometimes having to see up to 60 patients a day, they no longer have the resources to do such visits.
As it is, Ms Clarke does not need a hospital visit and is left to recuperate at home.
East of England paramedic on ambulance delay 'crisis'
Ed Wisken has been a paramedic for 13 years.
An advanced paramedic specialising in urgent care, Mr Wisken says: ""It is really sad to see patients who have had to wait such a long time for an ambulance - but this is just the culmination of years of underfunding and of reduced resources peaking now where demand outstrips supply.""
""It is upsetting to see it,"" he says. ""It is not nice to see people who have been waiting hours and hours for an ambulance - but we have really hit crisis point now.""
He says the morale of fellow paramedics and other healthcare workers is currently very low.
""The key is you just have to do just one job at a time and just take the patients that you see and do the best for them,"" he says.
""If you worry about the bigger picture too much you will get frustrated and angry - but that's not going to be beneficial for yourself or your patients.""
From Oulton Broad, the crew is then called to Thorpe St Andrew, near Norwich, to see 97-year-old Eva Denny.
mergency services were called because those around her feared she may have had a stroke.
Family friend Yvonne Pechey says Ms Denny recently spent five weeks in hospital. During her stay, she went from being able to get around using her walking frame to losing the use of her legs.
ramedics check Ms Denny over and find she has an infection.  
Antibiotics are prescribed, but the crew has to wait more than 90 minutes for a GP to call them back to discuss medicine and a plan for Ms Denny's future care. 
GP wants to have her taken to hospital, but the family says given her previous deterioration in hospital they want her to stay put.
Instead, Ms Denny's infection will be managed at home.
Anna Savage is a former estate agent who ""kind of stumbled"" into the ambulance service.
An emergency medical technician, Ms Savage says she applied to the East of England Ambulance Service after speaking with friends already working there.
""I thought it would suit me, not being in an office job but being out and about and I haven't looked back,"" she says. ""I enjoy it and I want to keep going.""
""Every day is different,"" she says. ""I knew it could be a strain on you and your family life and I wasn't under any illusions.
""Delays at the moment are a big challenge for us to deal with.""
She says she senses the frustration felt by patients and their loved ones experiencing ambulance delays.
""And we can't really give them an answer either, we can only deal with the here and now and each situation.""
She wants the service to find a way of reducing such delays.
rd call takes the crew to a house near Wroxham, in Norfolk, where nine-year-old Max has complex epilepsy.
He experiences up to 30 fits each day.
His mother, Amy, administers midazolam as prescribed but, because it is strong medication, Max needs monitoring.
rew takes him straight to the children's assessment ward at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.  
Amy says dealing with Max's condition is ""really difficult"".
""They still don't really know why he has these seizures,"" she says. ""It impacts on his quality of life and on our family life.
""He's under a professor in the United States and is having tests at Great Ormond Street, but it is really hard when someone cannot tell you what is wrong with your child.
""They don't know why his medicine does not control his seizures, so he can't live a normal life at the moment. 
""The seizures are so severe that they always require medical intervention and he spends the majority of his life in a hospital.
""It is really tough.""
On this occasion, both a land ambulance and the East of England Air Ambulance were sent to Max's aid.
""Being surrounded by people who are able to help him in that situation makes me feel a bit safer, because I just panic like any mum or dad would.""
Stuart Knight is the leading operations manager at Gorleston ambulance station.
""We are experiencing handover delays at the hospital, which is obviously impacting wider in the community. It is a national pressure at the minute.
""Our crews are late off and it impacts on our vehicle availability for the next day.
""They can be anywhere from Cambridge to Ipswich, so they are driving a hell of a lot of miles and, if they are late off on top of that due to delays or if they get a late job, then that impacts on the following day because obviously they need an adequate rest period before they come in for their [next] shift.
""We've got welfare ideas to help staff and we are working with colleagues in the hospital to try and reduce delays.
""The last thing we want is for patients to be stuck in the back of an ambulance for 10 to 12 hours. It is not great for patients, it is not great for the crew. When that happens we can't get to patients in the community.""
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Nobody should have to wait longer than necessary for emergency care, which is why we are taking urgent action to support services.
""This includes an extra £500m to speed up hospital discharge and free up beds - the details of which were announced on Wednesday - getting ambulances back on the road more quickly, delivering 50,000 more nurses, increasing the number of NHS 999 and 111 call handlers and creating the equivalent of at least 7,000 more beds.""

sports	Mallory Franklin: GB's most successful female canoeist still driven by career ambition	"Great Britain's most successful female canoeist of all time says she is still hungry for success.
Mallory Franklin won silver at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and is a five-time World and seven-time European champion.
""100 per cent I still enjoy waking up everyday and knowing that I'm going to work on the water,"" she told BBC Radio Berkshire.
""Even when it's cold and ice is forming on my helmet, it's about having fun, learning and making the most of it.""
28-year-old from Windsor has had another successful season and recently claimed a gold and two silver medals at the ICF Canoe Slalom World Cup Final in Spain.
She topped the podium in the extreme kayak event - one of the new additions to the Olympic Games programme for Paris 2024 - to be crowned the World Cup's overall champion in the discipline for 2022.
""Extreme slalom is similar to kayaking with a double ended paddle but the boats and format are quite different. 
""The poles down the course are inflatables and there's four of you racing down the course at the same time.
""It's more of a battle!""
Franklin is now preparing to take on the best athletes from around the UK in the British Slalom Open at the Lee Valley White Water Centre, which was built for the London 2012 Olympic Games.
""It's a world-class venue and most countries would consider it one of the best in the world,"" added Franklin.
""From a British canoeing perspective, the facilities and gym are really good, we have physiotherapy, performance analysis, good controllable water that is pumped so we can move the course around. The whole of Lee Valley is a great environment for training.""
Olympic silver medallist, who has been canoeing most of her life, has had a remarkable rise through the sport and admits her interest in it came as a bit of a fluke.
""I started paddling before I even started school.
""My brother was a little too active and his teachers encouraged my parents to find something for him to do, so we went to the local leisure centre in Windsor and tried swimming.
""But next door was the Windsor and District Canoe Club, and they were having an open day with a barbecue and all the boats out for people to try, for fun.
""I instantly took to it and never stopped - I think I've been canoeing for 23 years now!""
Franklin says her desire to keep improving is one of the biggest factors that has allowed her to stay at the top of her game for so long, but she admits success in the sport does not come without sacrifice.
""In those years that shape you, 12 and 13, when kids are having parties, I wasn't always invited because I wasn't really that social and I didn't go round people's houses after school because I was always training or away at the weekends - those were probably the biggest sacrifices when I was young. 
""As you get older it's more of a physical sacrifice because you put your body through a lot and there is the mental toll too, you have depressed and elated periods, all those emotions can be a strain. 
""Maybe if I had gone and had a more normal life I wouldn't have had that amount of stress. But I've grown a lot and I'm much stronger because of it.""
Franklin's haul of medals hang proudly on the wall in her living room as a constant reminder of her years of achievement and success in the sport. Only her Olympic silver medal is tucked away in a box somewhere safe.
She has thought about when she might retire. But it will not be before she completes her main goal, which she is still hungry to achieve before she calls time on her outstanding career.
""My biological clock is probably what will dictate my finish line in this sport. I want to have kids and I don't want to leave that too long. 
""But my overall goal is to be world number one. To be the best over a long period of time and over a set of races. I want to be the person who turns up to a race and is always expected to do well."""	/sport/canoeing/63063368
business	Firms still fretting over energy bills despite price cap	"Gas and electricity costs for UK businesses, charities and public sector bodies are set to be capped under a new government package.
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has suggested that the move could stop companies from collapsing under the weight of soaring energy bills this winter.
While some trade bodies have welcomed the news, others like UK Hospitality warned that the government must avoid a ""cliff-edge"" when the six months of help finishes at the end of March.
BBC has spoken to several firms across different sectors about what the announcement could mean for them. 
At Ye Olde Fleece Inn in Kendal, Cumbria, they have not ""done the maths"" yet, but are relieved to have more certainty.
rise they were facing - from £44,000 a year for gas and electric, to around £124,000 a year - will be avoided, for now. 
""That some help is coming gives us a bit of hope,"" says Josh Farrant, front of house manager. ""But we are still massively going to have to look at the way we do things.""
Customers are already having to forgo sourdough toast - the cost of running the grill is ""ridiculous"" at current prices, says Mr Farrant.
'll be looking at other kitchen equipment and whether they can rely more on the pub's log fires, less on central heating.
And while the government support is very welcome, Mr Farrant still has concerns, especially about what will happen in a few months time.
""It doesn't mean the panic is over,"" he says. ""It's going to run for six months, then we'll see.""
Kate Phillips is relieved to have ""a reprieve"" over the rising cost of running her chain of indoor climbing walls.
""In the medium-term, it means we can run some heating this winter,"" she says. ""Our original plan was to warn our customers to bring warm jackets with them.""
may still be necessary come the spring. These vast indoor spaces cost a lot to heat and the help is only temporary.
""It's all a bit last minute, all a bit ""short-period"", leaving us not sure what will happen in six months' time,"" she says.
Climbers don't want it as warm as at a gym, Kate explains, as they don't want their hands to sweat. ""But they do want to be able to feel their fingers.""
me fixed rate deals still in place for electricity, so Ms Phillips is trying to work out if they will save more by investing in more electric heating.
She hopes that will leave some ""wiggle room"" to offer more hours, or recruit new staff over the winter when they're at their busiest.

""This doesn't help us at all!"" says Nimisha Raja, founder of Nim's Fruit Crisps, who was not impressed with the level of intervention.
Air-drying crisps uses large amounts of energy and gas is her single biggest cost.
She points out the scheme doesn't offer help with daily standing charges - the fee customers pay for being connected to the energy grid.
""When we entered into a new contract on April 1st, the only option available to my business was one with a £14 per day standing charge.""
firm's gas bills have increased from £2,500 a month on average to about £7,500 as a result, she says.
She would like the government to have been bolder, including reforming the energy market, or considering a bigger windfall tax on the energy companies that are benefiting from higher prices, a move the new prime minister has ruled out.
""Small and medium-sized businesses need a little bit more from the government,"" Ms Raja says. 
""What will - and is already - slowing down growth across all sectors is the crippling energy costs, forcing many small businesses to close.""
Angie Monroe, who runs a small salon in Stourport, Worcestershire, says her energy bills have tripled in the past year to around £280 a month on average in the summer.
""It's mainly only me here serving customers,"" she says ""But my prediction will be come winter my bills will double again, even with the cap in place because of the energy used in the heating and appliances we've got to use.""
It's already a struggle making ends meet with costs for hair colour and gloves increasing recently. 
""It's frustrating because I want to know why this [scheme] wasn't put in place sooner,"" Ms Monroe says.
But above all she is wondering what will happen long-term after the support package comes to an end next March.
""We might feel secure for that time, but lots of businesses out there will still be anxious, wondering what their bills are going to look like in the future.
McKenzie, the policy and advocacy chair at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""Small businesses are the definition of vulnerable when it comes to these energy price hikes.
""[They do not] have the ability to hedge, or negotiate energy prices, so we will be encouraging government to continue to help small businesses across all different sectors after the six months have elapsed.""
Many still face ""a tough year"" ahead, she says."	/news/business-62980637
business	UK economy shrank more than previously thought	"UK economy shrank by more than first thought in the three months to September, revised figures show. 
my contracted by 0.3%, compared with a previous estimate of 0.2%, as business investment performed worse than first thought, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Growth figures for the first half of 2022 have also been revised down.
UK is forecast to fall into recession in the final three months of the year as soaring prices hit growth. 
A country is considered to be in recession when its economy shrinks for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. Typically companies make less money, pay falls and unemployment rises, leaving the government with less money in tax to use on public services.
Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""Our revised figures show the economy performed slightly less well over the last year than we previously estimated"", with manufacturing ""notably weaker"".
He added that household incomes, when accounting for rising prices, continued to fall, and household spending ""fell for the first time since the final Covid-19 lockdown in the spring of 2021"". 
ONS said that gross domestic product (GDP) - the measure of the size of the economy - was now estimated to be 0.8% below where it was before the pandemic struck, downwardly revised from the previous estimate of 0.4% below.
my has been hit as surging energy and food prices push inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to its highest level in 40 years. 
It means that consumers are spending less and businesses are cutting investment.
Along with its revision for the July-to-September period, the ONS said the economy also grew less than first estimated in the first half of the year - expanding by 0.6% in the first quarter and 0.1% in the second quarter.
ONS has previously said growth stood at 0.7% and 0.2% in those quarters respectively.
It is not unusual for the ONS to revise its growth estimates. It produces a first estimate of GDP about 40 days after the quarter in question, at which point only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised later as more information comes in.
We already knew the UK economy shrank in the third quarter of the year while other economies grew. But now the disparity between the UK and the rest of the world looks starker than previously thought. 
An economy that remains 0.8% smaller than its pre-pandemic level is in marked contrast to the eurozone - up 2.2% at the last count - or Canada - up by 3%. 
Paris-based think tank the OECD recently forecast in 2023, the UK economy would continue shrinking by more than the rest of the G7, while other economies returned to growth. 
re's now a growing body of evidence that some of that underperformance is due to Brexit. 
Last week, figures from the ONS indicated that the economy shrank by 0.3% over the August-to-October period.
government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has warned that the UK will fall into a recession ""lasting just over a year"".
OBR has predicted that the economy will shrink by 1.4% in 2023 before growth gradually picks up again.
As a result it expects the unemployment rate to rise and house prices to fall sharply as the Bank of England puts up interest rates to control soaring prices. 
Last week, the Bank raised its key rate to 3.5%, the highest level for 14 years, which is pushing up repayment costs for people with mortgages and loans.
UK is not the only country seeing its economy slow down, with the US and eurozone also expected to fall into recession next year. 
However, Gabriella Dickens from Pantheon Macroeconomics said she expected the UK to ""suffer the deepest recession among major advanced economies in 2023"".
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt blamed Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine for the economic difficulties.
""High inflation driven by Putin's invasion of Ukraine is slowing economic growth across the world. No country is immune, least of all Britain,"" he said.
But responding to the latest ONS figures, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves accused the government of losing control over the economy.
""GDP data has been revised down, leaving the UK with the worst growth in the G7 in the last quarter,"" she tweeted.
""The Tories have lost control of the economy and are leaving millions of working people paying the price."""	/news/business-64062548
health	Sacked health minister hits out at former political colleagues	"Isle of Man's recently sacked health minister has accused his former department's political members of ""behavioural issues"". 
Rob Callister was dismissed from the Department of Health and Social Care last week after seven weeks in post.
In response, the department's three political members said they ""utterly refute"" his claims.
Chief Minister Alfred Cannan said the ""serious matters"" needed to be investigated. 
ue was raised in Tynwald in an urgent question on the stability of the Manx government following the sacking.
Mr Cannan told politicians the dismissal was in the ""greater interests"" of healthcare on the island, but refused to elaborate on the specific reason for Mr Callister's removal.
Replying to those comments, Mr Callister said he was ""absolutely appalled"", stating he had raised issues about the behaviour of the department's political members when he was in charge.
In a joint statement released following the exchange, department members Michelle Haywood, Joney Faragher and Tanya August-Hanson said they were ""sorry"" Mr Callister felt they had acted ""in any way unprofessionally"".
But the trio said they ""utterly refute"" the claims made in his ""outburst"" in Tynwald, and would cooperate with any subsequent investigation.
It comes after they wrote to the chief minster to say Mr Callister's appointment had ""exacerbated"" levels of ""unsettlement amongst staff, depleted morale, and evident uncertainty"" within the health department.  
Mr Cannan was under fire for a lack of transparency from some in the court, including Tim Glover MHK who repeatedly asked what had changed ""in the 50-odd days"" between Mr Callister's appointment and dismissal.
f minister said the government was tackling ""critical issues"", while Mr Glover was ""sitting moaning on the backbenches"".
""If you want to create an omelette, along the way a few eggs often do get cracked, and we're going to carry on focusing on creating the right omelette for this island,"" he added.
However, he said the allegations made by Mr Callister would now ""need to be properly looked"".

technology	How are 'kamikaze' drones being used by Russia and Ukraine?	"Ukraine has accused Russia of using Iranian drones against civilian targets in Kyiv.
rry explosives which detonate on impact and are launched in waves, making it hard to defend against.
It's believed Russia has been using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in the Ukraine conflict since mid-September.
Also called the Geranium-2 by Russia, it has explosives in a warhead on its nose and is designed to loiter over a target until it is instructed to attack.
Shahed-136 has a wingspan of about 2.5m (8.2ft) and can be hard to detect on radar. 
It's unclear exactly how many Russia has, but the US has said Iran planned to send hundreds to Russia. Iran has denied doing so.
Russia was first reported to have used a Shahed-136 drone on 13 September, attacking targets near Kupiansk, a city in the Kharkiv region in the east of the country.
Later that month, it was used in attacks in the south. Debris from the drones were found in wreckage in Odesa and Mykolaiv. 
In October, Shahed-136 drones landed on civilian areas in the city of Bila Tserkva, south of Kyiv.
On 14 December, Ukrainian officials say they shot down over a dozen drones during a Russian attack on Kyiv.
Russia may be using these drones rather than cruise missiles because they are relatively cheap - about $20,000 (£17,800) each. 
Ukrainian armed forces have used small arms fire, heavy machine guns, portable anti-air missiles and electronic jamming devices to try and shoot down the drones. 
Ukraine's armed forces claimed on 25 October that they had shot down 223 Shahed-136 drones in the preceding 36 days, which is 85% of the total launched by Russia.
However, it is almost impossible to shoot down every single suicide drone, when they are sent in large numbers.
""They fly low and you can send them in waves. These swarms of drones are much harder to counter by air defences,"" military expert Justin Crump told the BBC.
It's not clear whether these have been used by Ukraine, but the US has said it is sending it 700 of its Switchblade kamikaze drones, and experts say kamikaze drones may have been deployed in recent attacks on a Russian military base in western Crimea, on an airbase near Sevastopol, and on ships in Sevastopol harbour.
Dr Marina Miron, researcher in defence studies at King's College London, says they may have been rudimentary drones made in Ukraine.
""If you look at the explosions in the attacks, they are quite small,"" she says. ""I suspect that these are homemade drones, which have had explosives strapped to them.""
Ukraine's main military drone is the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2. It is about the size of a small plane, has cameras on board, and can be armed with laser-guided bombs.
At the outset of the war, Ukraine had a fleet of ""fewer than 50"" of these, says Dr Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think-tank.
US said it is sending Ukraine 700 Switchblade drones, which are also kamikaze drones. 
Russia also uses the ""smaller, more basic"" Orlan-10, which have cameras and can carry small bombs. 
For both sides - Russia and Ukraine - drones have been effective for locating enemy targets and guiding artillery fire toward them.
""Russian forces can bring their guns to bear on the enemy within only three to five minutes of an Orlan-10 drone spotting a target,"" says Dr Watling. An attack could otherwise take 20-30 minutes to carry out.
Dr Marina Miron says drones have allowed Ukraine to stretch its limited forces.
""If you wanted to seek out enemy positions in the past, you would have had to send out special forces units... and you might lose some troops,"" she says. ""Now, all you're risking is a drone.""
In the first few weeks of the war, Ukraine's Bayraktar drones were widely praised.
""They were shown attacking targets such as ammunition dumps, and played a part in the sinking of the Moskva [warship],"" Dr Miron says. 
However, the Bayraktar is a large and slow moving drone, and Russia has been able to counter it effectively with its air defence systems.
Military drones are expensive to replace - a single Bayraktar TB2 costs about $2m (£1.7m).
So, both sides - but especially Ukraine - also use small, commercial models, such as the DJI Mavic 3, which costs about £1,700. 
mmercial drones can be fitted with small bombs. However, they are mainly used to spot enemy troops and to direct attacks.
""Ukraine doesn't have as much ammunition as Russia,"" says Dr Miron. ""Having 'eyes in the sky' to spot targets and direct artillery fire means they can make better use of what they have.""
But commercial drones are much less capable than military ones. 
For example, the DJI Mavic's total flying distance is only 30km, and it can only fly for a maximum of 46 minutes. 
Russia is using electronic devices to counter them, says Dr Miron.
""Russian forces have the Stupor rifle, which shoots electromagnetic pulses,"" she says. This stops commercial drones from being able to navigate using GPS, she explains.
Watch: The volunteers using drones to monitor Russian troops
Russian forces have also used online systems, such as Aeroscope, to detect and interrupt communications between commercial drones and their operators.

It said there had been a ""serious incident"" affecting its IT systems in the last 24 hours, with disruption to ""behind the scenes services"".
mpany said it was continuing to publish globally to its website - one of the most visited news sites in the world - and was ""confident"" it could still print the physical paper.
Staff have been told not to go into the office and to work from home.
In a statement, the Guardian said: ""Our technology teams have been working to deal with all aspects of this incident, with the vast majority of our staff able to work from home as we did during the pandemic.
""We believe this to be a ransomware attack, but are continuing to consider all possibilities.""
Ransomware is malicious software used by hackers - and often sent via attachments in emails - to gain access to an organisation's or individual's computer systems.
riminals then find and encrypt important or sensitive files - and demand a ransom for them to be unlocked.
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
A huge range of targets - from schools and hospitals to government agencies and media organisations - have fallen victim to ransomware, with research indicating hackers are paid in the majority of cases, especially in the UK.
According to the Press Gazette, the Guardian is the ninth most-read news site in the world, with almost 390 million visits in November.
In its own reporting of the incident, the Guardian said online publishing was ""largely unaffected"".
It said Guardian Media Group chief executive Anna Bateson and editor-in-chief Katharine Viner had sent a message to the company's workforce.
""Thank you to everyone working hard throughout this incident to keep us publishing,"" they said.
""We will continue to keep our staff and anyone else affected informed. 
""With a few key exceptions, we would like everyone to work from home for the remainder of the week unless we notify you otherwise.""
Jake Moore, global cyber-security adviser at security software company ESET, said the Guardian being targeted was not a surprise.
""News organisations have become a regular target for cyber-attacks this year, and these attacks often have even more damaging effects on the companies targeted,"" he said.
""Ransomware can often bring all departments to a standstill, so it is fortunate that despite this attack the organisation will still see some key areas working as usual."" "	/news/technology-64056300
health	Scottish Ambulance Service staff set date for industrial action	"Scottish ambulance staff are set to take industrial action on 25 November over a pay dispute.
Around 1,500 Unite members – including paramedics, advanced practitioners, planners and administrative workers – will take part.
union says it is also considering co-ordinated strike action with other NHS staff unless the Scottish government submits a new pay offer.
Ministers have warned there is no more money to fund public sector pay rises.
Unite said all of its Scottish Ambulance Service workers would take ""continuous action short of strike"" from 00.01 on 25 November.  
will include an overtime ban and work to rule. This means staff will adhere strictly to contractual terms on working hours and scheduled breaks.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he was disappointed by the move and he was ""committed to ongoing discussions to avoid strikes"". 
Unite's general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""Unite is determined to encourage the Scottish government to return to the negotiating table. 
""The action short of strike we have announced is designed to prevent all out strike action but make no mistake about this, if there is no new improved offer then this is exactly what will happen and the Scottish government will be to blame.""
It comes after the union's NHS members including paramedics, theatre assistants and laboratory workers voted against a flat pay offer from the government earlier this month. 
Scottish ministers had proposed a pay rise of £2,205 for all staff - an average 7% pay uplift, or more than 11% for the lowest paid. 
Unite said it was considering co-ordinated strike action with the other NHS trade unions if its industrial action does not prompt an improved offer.
Members of the Royal College of Nursing, the GMB union and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy have backed strike action. 
But Unison, Scotland's largest health union, has suspended its strike ballot of NHS staff and is consulting its members on a revised pay offer until 14 November.
Jamie McNamee, Unite Scottish Ambulance Service convenor, said: ""The offer currently on the table is insufficient and unacceptable. In real terms it represents a significant pay cut. 
""The present situation is directly contributing to the NHS losing senior staff due to being overworked and poorly paid. 
""Our NHS workers deserve better from the Scottish government and now they have a final opportunity to make a fair pay offer before this pay dispute dramatically escalates.""
Finance Secretary John Swinney has said that although cash had been moved around in the health budget to give NHS staff a better offer, further pay uplifts would mean cuts elsewhere.
Mr Swinney announced £615m of spending cuts in his emergency budget review. It came on top of £560m worth cuts to public services in September.
His colleague, Mr Yousaf, the health secretary, said: I'm disappointed Unite members in the Scottish Ambulance Service are taking industrial action.
""I have always stressed that dialogue is essential and I am committed to ongoing discussions to avoid strikes.

politics	Sizewell C: Government's progress on funding criticised	"Anti-nuclear power campaigners have criticised the government for not providing more financial information in its announcement about how Sizewell C could be funded.
government said applying a new funding model to the firm behind the plant in Suffolk was ""significant"".
It said private investors could be attracted by getting a return up front.
Stop Sizewell C said redacted figures meant it was impossible to know if it represented value for money.
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has outlined its draft reasons for designating Sizewell C's operating company, NNB Generation Company (SZC) Limited, as able to receive funding through the new Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model.
French energy company EDF and the UK government have said they would take 20% stakes in Sizewell C.
It has been estimated Sizewell C would cost £20bn to construct.
RAB would allow investors to get a return on their money during the build, rather than waiting until electricity was generated, the government said.
government said ""over the 60-year lifetime of a generic new large-scale nuclear power station, our funding model could reduce the project cost by more than £30bn"".
Energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng said the RAB designation represented ""significant progress towards implementing a new funding model which will give nuclear projects the financial support they need and attract private investment"".
""Private investors receive greater certainty through a lower and more reliable rate of return in the early stages of a project, lowering the cost of financing it, and ultimately helping reduce consumer electricity bills,"" he said.
government wants to build eight new nuclear power plants to reduce the UK's dependence on fossil fuels and energy imports.
While local councils and businesses expect Sizewell C to boost the local economy, opponents say nuclear plants are slow to build, expensive, inherently risky and threaten local wildlife.
Alison Downes, from Stop Sizewell C, said: ""It's outrageous that ministers are hiding the cost to electricity bill payers and the public purse of Sizewell C, while claiming to be transparent. 
""By redacting the finances, it is impossible to know if the secretary of state's judgement on value for money is sound.
""The government intends to take a special share in Sizewell C, as a means of 'protecting national security interests', yet there is no mention of removing China General Nuclear from the project.""
A separate decision on whether to grant government planning approval for Sizewell C is due on 8 July.

""We have done all we can do to maintain services and maintain the safety of those services.""
rust said replacement systems are in place, but are time consuming and more people have had to be employed as a result, impacting agency spend.

wo rock legends have sold their catalogues in recent deals worth between $400m and $500m. Neil Young also earned $150m by selling a 50% share in his music in 2021.
Stars selling their catalogues has become a major music industry trend in recent years, with artists including Blondie, Shakira, Mark Ronson, Chic, Tina Turner and The Killers also handing over control of their songs in exchange for large lump sums.
For them, the deals provide immediate financial security, while ensuring their music does not fall into complicated litigation after they die.

politics	Ukraine war: US says Iranian drones breach sanctions	"US says it agrees with Western allies that Iran's supply of explosive drones to Russia violates UN sanctions.
Kyiv was struck by so-called ""kamikaze"" drones on Monday, unleashed by Russia but believed to be Iranian-made.
US agrees with the French and British assessment that the drones violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231, the US State Department said.
resolution, linked to Iran's nuclear accord, bars Iranian transfers of certain military technologies.
Ukraine has identified the drones - or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - as Iranian Shahed-136 weapons. They are called kamikaze drones after the Japanese fighter pilots who flew suicide missions in World War Two.
""It is our belief that these UAVs that were transferred from Iran to Russia and used by Russia in Ukraine are among the weapons that would remain embargoed under 2231,"" said Vedant Patel of the state department. 
Iran denies supplying them to Russia, but Mr Patel said the US ""exposed publicly that Russia has received drones from Iran, that this was part of Russia's plan to import hundreds of Iranian UAVs of various types"". 
He added that there was ""extensive proof"" of Russia's use of them in Ukraine.
Critical infrastructure was hit on Monday in Ukraine's Kyiv, Dnipro and Sumy regions, with electricity cut in hundreds of towns and villages, the Kyiv government said. 
At least eight people were killed - four in Kyiv and four in Sumy. The US said it would ""hold [Russia] accountable for its war crimes.""
Mr Patel said the deepening alliance between Russia and Iran was something the whole world should see as a threat. Russia and Iran have provided key military support for President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war.
""Anyone doing business with Iran, that can have any link to UAVs or ballistic missile developments or the flow of arms from Iran to Russia, should be very careful and do their due diligence. The US will not hesitate to use sanctions,"" Mr Patel warned.
Monday's attack came a week after Russia fired dozens of missiles at Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, many of them targeting energy infrastructure. Western analysts believe the Iranian weapon is helping Russia to keep up long-range attacks despite a shortage of precision missiles.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says the EU is also ""gathering evidence"" on the Iranian drones and is ready to act - implying a possible intensification of sanctions.
Negotiations to revive the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran are currently stalled. Under the deal with Western powers, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions."	/news/world-europe-63294698
politics	Audit Wales: Care homes 'given cash for dead residents'	"Some care homes in Wales were paid for people who had died, a spending watchdog has found. 
In 11 cases local authorities continued to pay the homes for people after their deaths at an average cost of £14,545. 
A fraud initiative also led to the cancellation of 2,717 blue badges, which are intended for use by people with disabilities to park closer to their destinations.
xercise found people were using the badges of others who had died.
review by Audit Wales discovered that fraud cost the public sector £6.5m last year. 
It said that 81% of overpayments had been or were in the process of being recovered.
ual review of the books of public bodies found most of the problems involved council tax discounts (£2.6m), blue badges (£1.4m) and housing waiting lists (£800,000).
Students not entitled to help made up the majority of fraudulent and erroneous claims for housing benefit, at a cost of £600,000.
£1.4m cost of improper blue badge use is based on a estimate of lost parking revenues.
""I was quite surprised at the level of blue badges in Wales that [are] apparently fraud,"" said Alexandra Osborne from Disability Wales, the national association of disabled peoples' organisations.
She said she was disappointed by the finding and there should not be more checks on blue badge use.
""The biggest thing is people are not being truthful when someone's passed away and just keep using the badge,"" she said. ""(I'm a) bit worried the media will focus on benefit cheats because it's such a lifeline to so many of us.""
She said disabled people already face abuse from people questioning if they deserve a blue badge. 
""I don't look disabled,"" she explained. ""I've had a blue badge since I was a kid and have always had this negativity."" 
Wales Auditor General Adrian Crompton said: ""Identifying £6.5m in this latest national fraud initiative exercise is an important contribution to public service funding across Wales. 
""It is more important than ever that organisations have sound governance and controls in place to help protect vital services from the risk of fraud,"" he added.

World number one Hill won silver at the shooting World Cup in May and finished sixth at the Rio 2016 Games.
Hill says she is ""absolutely devastated"" by the news, which came before she had left for Japan.
She was due to participate in Sunday's qualifying event with the final scheduled to take place on Monday. 
British Olympic Association confirmed Hill's positive test and added there would be no replacement for the 23-year-old.
""There are no words to describe how I'm feeling right now,"" Hill said.
""After five years of training and preparation, I'm absolutely devastated to say that last night I received a positive Covid-19 test, meaning I've had to withdraw from Team GB's shooting team.
""Although I don't have any symptoms, I will now isolate as per the government guidance."" 
Swimmer Ilya Borodin, 2020 European champion in the men's 400m individual medley, will also miss the Games, the Russian Swimming Federation said.
18-year-old tested positive for coronavirus during a training camp before departing for Japan.
One athlete who feared her Games might be over after she was identified as a close contact of a member of the public who tested positive on the flight to Japan has been given hope she can compete.
British 400m hurdler Jessie Knight was part of a group of six athletes identified as a close contact of someone two rows away on her flight.
""When I was initially told, I was just told 'Oh Jessie we need to speak to you' so my heart dropped and to be honest I thought I'd tested positive,"" the 27-year-old told BBC Sport. ""The fact that I was just a close contact, I was really relieved.""
rotocols in place mean she is isolated from athletes who have not been affected but with twice-a-day testing, and social distancing between her and her coach, she is still able to train.
""You don't want to miss 14 days of training going into the biggest race of your life so I was panicking but it was communicated so quickly that I would be able to train so long as we were providing those negative tests.""

business	Female avatar sexually assaulted in Meta VR platform, campaigners say	"Campaigners say the avatar of a 21-year-old researcher was sexually assaulted in Meta's virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds.
Corporate accountability group SumOfUs, for whom the researcher works, says it shows Meta needs better plans to mitigate harms in the metaverse.
Meta's annual shareholder meeting takes place on Wednesday.
mpany told the BBC there were safety tools in Horizon Worlds to help people have a ""positive experience"".
Noting that Meta had not yet seen the full SumOfUs report, a spokesperson told the BBC the firm wanted everyone in Horizon Worlds to access the safety procedures ""and help us investigate and take action"".
Horizon Worlds is currently only available to users in the US and Canada. Avatars in the platform have a simplified, cartoonish appearance.
SumOfUs says that virtual assaults can be intensely traumatic.
""It still counts, it still has a real impact on users,"" the group's campaigns director Vicky Wyatt told the BBC Tech Tent podcast.
Ms Wyatt said the researcher subjected to the alleged assault felt that ""part of them was really shocked, part of them thought, 'OK, this isn't my real body, this is an avatar' and another part of them thought 'this is really, really important research that I'm doing, I need to capture this footage'"".
BBC has seen some of that footage. The avatar of the researcher is not in vision, as it is taken from her perspective, but there are two male avatars in the room, one of whom is observing while the other appears very close to her. The pair make lewd comments and share a virtual bottle of drink.
re is no single agreed definition of the metaverse, and proponents admit it is a work-in-progress.
It draws upon several different pre-existing technologies, including virtual reality and augmented reality.
metaverse is not a single space, and many different 3D virtual environments - including established games and virtual worlds - are said to be part of it. 
Of the parts of the metaverse that presently exist, only some - such as Horizon Worlds - are owned by Meta. However, the company has championed the idea, is investing billions of dollars in developing the concept and plans to hire thousands of staff to work on it.
Earlier reports of virtual assaults on avatars and inappropriate ""creepy"" behaviour prompted Meta to introduce new safeguards into its virtual worlds in February
Personal Boundary prevents avatars from coming within a set distance of each other, making it easier to avoid these unwanted interactions.
It stops others ""invading your avatar's personal space"", said Meta.
""If someone tries to enter your Personal Boundary, the system will halt their forward movement as they reach the boundary.""
According to Meta, the default Personal Boundary setting is roughly 4ft (1.2m) virtual distance between your avatar and those of anyone not on your friends list.
mpany says it also offers a number of ways to block and report users.
According to SumOfUs, the researcher was ""encouraged"" to disable the Personal Boundary feature.
researcher also witnessed homophobic slurs and virtual gun violence, the group claims.
SumOfUS has filed a resolution with a small group of shareholders, asking for a risk assessment of the human rights impacts of the metaverse to be conducted by the company. 
group also criticised a recent blog post by Meta's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg.
In it, he wrote: ""We wouldn't hold a bar manager responsible for real-time speech moderation in their bar, as if they should stand over your table, listen intently to your conversation, and silence you if they hear things they don't like."" 
Ms Wyatt says that Meta needs to act now to tackle issues: ""Rather than Facebook rushing headlong into building this metaverse, we're saying look, you need to stop look at all the harms that are happening on your platforms right now that you can't even deal with. 
""Let's not repeat and replicate those in the metaverse. We need a better plan here on how to mitigate online harms in the metaverse""."	/news/technology-61573661

technology	WitchTok: The witchcraft videos with billions of views	"When you think of TikTok, dance challenges, comedy creations and the latest earworms probably spring to mind.
But one of the latest trends is focused more on spells, potions and prophecies - witchcraft.
Videos with the hashtag WitchTok have amassed more than 30 billion views, and has made it easier for would-be witches to learn about it.
Creators say it's bringing the community closer than ever before.
kTok's #witch hashtag has received nearly 20 billion views, #witchtiktok has nearly two billion views, and #babywitch, a hashtag for those new to the craft, has more than 600 million views. 
Ayla Skinner, known as Witch in the Wilderness on TikTok, lives in Cornwall and has amassed followers by performing what she describes, as spells and magic.
She says it makes her feel empowered: ""Witchcraft, paganism, it all gives you a bit of control back, you can live your life how you want.""
""I live my life magically, I do magic every day. It gives people a real sense of individuality and the power to do things themselves,"" she said.
Ayla believes TikTok has enabled people of all ages, and from around the world, to be a part of the witchcraft community.
""Witchcraft years ago, you had to find a coven and get initiated and trained. Now you can go to your local bookstore and grab a witchcraft book or book about crystals,"" she says.
""TikTok has changed the way we practise witchcraft, it's so acceptable now to learn from social media.""
WitchTok content includes live-streaming tutorials, educational videos, and documenting the day-to-day lives of witches.
Frankie Castanea is from the USA and identifies as a gender-fluid Italian-American folk witch.
Frankie has 1.4 million followers through their Chaotic Witch Aunt TikTok page and has amassed more than 90 million likes through sharing content about witchcraft.
24-year-old said: ""Witchcraft in different cultures has different connotations. Witchcraft is not a religion, it's a belief, it's a spiritual practice.""
""The term 'witch' is one people elect to use themselves. It's so broad and encompasses so many traditions.""
Witchcraft can have connotations of the dark arts, but Ayla believes magic can be ""quite misunderstood"".
""Hollywood and Disney have created this very dark, very evil character, which isn't necessarily true,"" she said.
Prof Diane Purkis, from the University of Oxford, is the author of A Witch In History. She's examined the scepticism surrounding witchcraft, which she calls one of the ""oldest human societies"".
""There are witches in Classical times, in Greek and Roman literature,"" she says.
Historically, witchcraft was viewed as an explanation of sudden and unexpected ill-fortune, such as the death of a child or a bad harvest. 
Dr Isak Niehaus, Senior Lecturer at Brunel University London, specialises in African witchcraft and says it's a form many people around the world still believe to be true.  
""In Europe, witchcraft is seen more as the use of magical powers for any kind of purpose, largely for healing,"" he says.
""Whereas in Africa, envious and jealous people use witchcraft in the purpose of harm.
""In Africa no-one would own up to being a witch, the practice of witchcraft is secret and operated at night in hidden locations, their identity is always concealed,"" he said.
But Ayla believes the growing popularity of witchcraft is here to stay.
""Just like nature has light and dark so does witchcraft, and it's how you choose to use the light and the dark,"" she adds.

business	No going back to reliance on Russian gas from here	". Russia's state-controlled gas giant announced an indefinite extension to a three-day maintenance halt to flows of gas through the continent's key energy artery, hours after leading western finance ministers vowed to escalate sanctions on Russian oil.
Gazprom's official reason is that an oil leak has been found and the pipeline cannot work without German imports of technology, which are now subject to sanctions. 
Few observers believe, however, that this is anything other than an attempt essentially to blackmail Europe over supplies.
G7 world's main economies, including the UK, agreed to cap the price they pay for oil from Russia. This is a way to limit the revenues that fund the Kremlin's war in Ukraine - it earns more from oil exports than gas.
But this is a very serious development. Even during the height of the Cold War, Russia kept supplies of its gas flowing into Europe.
ut-off though - and the pointed attempt by Gazprom to blame the German energy giant Siemens for the malfunction - is the culmination of decades of dysfunction in the energy relationship between Russia and Germany. 
For most of that time, of course, Bonn and then Berlin were delighted to avail themselves of cheap Russian gas. 
A younger Vladimir Putin did his PhD thesis on the importance of Russian energy exports. 
When I visited Gazprom's headquarters a decade ago and its fields in Siberia, I was told menacingly ""anyone who artificially tries to diminish the role of Russian gas is playing a very dangerous game"". A visit to the Novi Urengoy field showed Gazprom consolidating its hold on the Russian state, with some assistance from Berlin.
Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder enshrined this dependence with the building of this same Nordstream pipeline, which then gave him a job on its board. Gazprom sponsored German football, Europe's premier football competition the Champions League, and bankrolled various Russian soft power projects.
Perhaps most incredibly, German industry swapped the gas storage facilities under its soil for privileged access to deep-lying gas reserves under the Siberian tundra. 
ry facilities, including Germany's largest, designed for resilience in the face of Russian energy diplomacy were passed into Russian ownership. It beggars belief that this was completed in 2015, after Russia's annexation of Crimea.
One sliver of hope, though, now lies in those same storage facilities. The German government seized ownership of the storage facilities that had been left at very low levels last year. 
re, and across the continent, energy companies backed by government loans have spent the summer buying up as much gas as possible at any price. 
major economies are now on course to fill massive stores of gas, designed to cope with a cut to supplies of several weeks. Germany's huge stores are now 84% full, having been less than half full in June.
As a result, gas prices traded in international markets have come down from extreme highs over the past week. But they are still very high by normal standards. 
re remains a dash to secure alternative supplies that is pushing up the price for all countries, including Britain. And the true impact of all this will depend on just how long the pipeline outage lasts.
But surely now, for Germany and the rest of Europe, there will be no going back to reliance on Russia."	/news/business-62779909

health	Warning Somerset GP agency spend is 'not sustainable'	"f an organisation that provides GP services has warned a chronic reliance on expensive agency staff is ""not sustainable"".
Symphony Healthcare Services (SHS) had to spend £3m on locum GPs in the past financial year across Somerset.
Medical director Dr Berge Balian warned ""difficult decisions will have to be made"" without improved funding. 
Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said there are 2,300 more GPs since 2019. 
But the Royal College of GPs does not recognise that figure, and said GP numbers had fallen by 713 fully qualified full-time equivalent positions since 2019. 
Commons Health Select Committee has itself said general practice is in crisis.
Dr Balian added: ""I think most people would recognise it is currently in crisis."" 
When SHS started in 2016, it took over three GP surgeries that could not attract enough partners to run them as a private business. 
Since then it has employed more and more salaried GPs to work in 16 surgeries across 20 locations in Somerset and Devon, with all rated good or outstanding by the Care Quality Commission. 
But over the years it has had to rely more heavily on expensive agency GPs that cost up to £1,000 a shift. 
And because SHS is owned by Yeovil hospital, this has contributed to a £12m spend on agency staff last year.
Dr Balian is a GP at Crewkerne Health Centre and said many doctors are retiring early because their job has become too stressful.
""In the last three years the number of consultations general practice has done in the country has increased by two million while the number of GPs has dropped by 1,800 roughly.
""You can see why it ends up being a significant pressure on those GPs who are responsible for managing that contract and caring for patients under that contract.""
Dr Balian also said there is a financial incentive for GPs to move away from being partners to work as locum doctors because they can earn more than £1,000 a day and also benefit from being in the NHS pension scheme. 
SHS spent £3m on GP locums in the year 2021-22 and Dr Balian said expanding further, with a bigger agency staff bill, is not sustainable. 
He said: ""If you look at general practice, demand is increasing, its capacity is reducing, its funding in real terms is also reducing.
""The only solution to that is either increasing the amount of funding into GPs, or you say actually, nationally we will make a decision that GPs that used to provide this amount of service can only provide this amount of service and that bit needs to be done elsewhere.""
Since it started SHS has set up a new model for family medicine which relies heavily on health coaches, physios and pharmacists to relieve pressure.
Mary Guppy is one of a growing number of ""health coaches"" employed by SHS to support vulnerable patients living in their home.
One of her regulars, Ivan Down, 81, is at risk of having to leave his home in Crewkerne to be admitted to hospital because he has dementia, and diabetes.
Mrs Guppy says an important part of her role is to look after carers, such as Ivan's 71-year-old wife Patricia.
Mrs Guppy said: ""Without Pat, we'd have to find some more care for Ivan, but thanks to her hard work and liaising with the health coaches we can go back to the GPs if there are any health concerns so we can keep him safe in his own environment and keep him well.""
A spokesman for the DHSC said: ""Supporting and growing the workforce is one of the Health and Social Care Secretary's priorities and there are over 2,300 more doctors in general practice compared to 2019, while a record 4,000 trainees have accepted a GP training place this year.
""We have taken action to promote NHS staff banks, which are managed by trusts and allow healthcare professionals to take up temporary shifts. 
""This reduces the requirement for agency staff, and as a consequence agency spend has dropped by a third since 2016.""

sports	Winter Olympics: Finnish skier Remi Lindholm suffers frozen penis in men's 50km cross-country	"Perhaps the worst part of it all for Finland's Remi Lindholm is that it was not even the first time it had happened.
Such was the chance of athletes suffering frostbite, freezing conditions at the Winter Olympics in Beijing had already seen the blue riband men's 50km cross-country ski delayed by an hour - and shortened to a 30km event.
But even those alterations could not save Lindholm from an ""unbearable"" fate.
mmediate concern for the 24-year-old, in the aftermath of completing the final event of his debut Olympic Games, was thawing out his frozen penis.
A heat pack eventually helped the Finn salvage the situation at the end of what was a gruelling race.
However, having spent almost one hour and 16 minutes out on the course in howling winds and appendage-threatening temperatures of -17C, he was, understandably, left in a tremendous amount of pain.
""You can guess which body part was a little bit frozen when I finished,"" Lindholm told Finnish media.
""It was one of the worst competitions I've been in. It was just about battling through.
""When the body parts started to warm up after the finish, the pain was unbearable.""
Poor Lindholm previously suffered a similar incident at a competition in Finland last year, with the thin suits and under layers worn by racers offering minimal protection from extreme cold."	/sport/winter-olympics/60466907
