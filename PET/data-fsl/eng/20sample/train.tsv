health	West Midlands GP calls for better support for veterans	"Doctor Robin Simpson said he did not want veterans to be disadvantaged by their service to the country
A former Army doctor has urged GP surgeries to sign up to a scheme to give military veterans better support and care.
Robin Simpson's own practice in Hampton in Arden, near Solihull, West Midlands, has become a ""veteran friendly"" surgery.
Royal College of GPs scheme gives them access to specialised guidance and training about what veterans may need.
""My vision is to improve the healthcare of veterans,"" he said.
m O'Sullivan served in Afghanistan as an Army reservist in 2007 and found last year's withdrawal of troops brought back painful memories. 
He said he was struggling to process them and turned to Mr Simpson's surgery for help.
""I came to speak to my GP who actually was incredibly understanding and got me some really good help very quickly,"" he said.
More than 1,300 practices in England have signed up to the scheme, according to the Royal College of GPs.
Former RAF pilot John Bransbury also uses the Hampton in Arden surgery and said it was a comfort knowing they understood his background.
""I think it's an excellent, excellent idea, really, to make GPs aware of the different circumstances under which service people actually work,"" he added.

entertainment	Sacheen Littlefeather: Native American activist and actor who refused Oscar for Brando dies	"Sacheen Littlefeather, the Native American activist who declined Marlon Brando's Oscar for The Godfather on his behalf in 1973, has died aged 75.
ress, who had breast cancer, died on Sunday, the Academy announced.
Her death comes two weeks after the organisation honoured her at a ceremony in Los Angeles, publicly apologising for her treatment at the Oscars.
Littlefeather, of Apache and Yaqui heritage, was booed while speaking on stage at the event 50 years ago.
Dressed in full Apache attire during the first Oscars to be televised around the world, the Californian, born Maria Cruz, explained on Brando's behalf that he would not accept his best actor gong for the mafia movie in order to protest against the treatment of Native Americans by the film industry and to bring attention to the Wounded Knee protests.
In 1973, several hundred locals, together with radical activists from the American Indian Movement (AIM), poured into the nearby village of Wounded Knee in South Dakota to protest government abuse.
rotest resulted in a violent stand-off with federal agents that went on for 71 days.
""I went up there, like a proud Indian woman with dignity, with courage, with grace, and with humility,"" she remembered at the recent event.
""I knew that I had to speak the truth. Some people may accept it. And some people may not.""
Screen Actors Guild member Littlefeather struggled to get work in the industry afterwards but said it was ""never too late for an apology... it's never too late for forgiveness.""
At the gala event at the Academy last month, Littlefeather appeared on stage in a wheelchair, laughing and entertaining the crowd, which included many Native and indigenous people working in the film industry. 
""I didn't represent myself. I was representing all indigenous forces out there. All indigenous people. Because we have never been heard in that way before,"" she told the BBC when asked about her speech at the Oscars nearly 50 years ago. 
Apache actress and activist said she faced decades of harassment for making that speech. 
""Somebody had to do it. And it was okay. And I had to pay the price.""
xt time a Native American makes a political Oscars speech it will likely be when they accept their own Academy award. The rules were changed after Littlefeather's speech and winners are now banned from sending someone else to collect, or reject, their statuette.   
In a recent interview with Variety, Littlefeather recalled the moment she walked off the stage in 1973.
""I was met with the stereotypical tomahawk chop, individuals who called at me, and I ignored all of them,"" she recalled. ""I continued to walk straight ahead with a couple of armed guards beside me, and I held my head high and was proud to be the first Indigenous woman in the history of the Academy Awards to make that political statement. 
""At that time in 1973, there was a media blackout on Wounded Knee and against the American Indian Movement that was occupying it,"" she went on. ""Marlon had called them in advance and asked them to watch the Academy Awards, which they did.
""As they saw me, up on stage, refusing that Academy Award for the stereotypes within the film industry, and mentioning Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it would break the media boycott.""
In 2020, Littlefeather told the BBC that straight after the speech she had to leave the stage with two security guards. But, she added, it ""was a very good thing"" as actor John Wayne was backstage. She said he was ""furious with Marlon and furious with me"" and wanted to pull her off stage himself.
Littlefeather featured in films like The Trial of Billy Jack, Johnny Firecloud and Counselor at Crime, but said she returned to San Francisco after being blacklisted by the industry, to continue her activism and work in health care and the theatre.
Paying tribute online on Monday, Dakota/Lakota Sioux writer and biologist Ruth H. Robertson, aka Red Road Woman, pointed to Littlefeather's work with the American Indian Aids Institute of San Francisco.
Lakota Man on Twitter offered: ""It's with a heavy heart that I mourn the passing of Sacheen Littlefeather. I wish her a blessed journey"", later adding: ""Honour her"".
V writer Joey Clift said: ""When I talk about how our current Native storytelling movement in Hollywood is built on the shoulders of activists fighting tirelessly for decades for Native people to finally get our day in the sun, I'm talking about Sacheen Littlefeather. RIP.""
In announcing her death online, the Academy quoted Littlefeather, the subject of the 2021 documentary, Sacheen: Breaking the Silence, saying: ""When I am gone, always be reminded that whenever you stand for your truth, you will be keeping my voice and the voices of our nations and our people alive."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63114459
business	Jerome Powell: US stock markets down after interest rate warning	"Stock markets in the US ended the week sharply down following tough comments by the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve.
k's chairman, Jerome Powell, said the bank must continue to raise interest rates to stop inflation from becoming a permanent aspect of the US economy.
His words sent US stocks into a tailspin, with markets tumbling 3%.
It comes as Americans are having to pay more for basic goods.
Inflation in the world's largest economy is at a four-decade high.
During a highly anticipated speech at a conference in Wyoming on Friday, Mr Powell said the Federal Reserve would probably impose further interest rate hikes in the coming months and could keep them high ""for some time"".
""Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,"" he said at the meeting in Jackson Hole.
Investors are concerned that if economic growth falters, higher interest rates will increase the likelihood of a recession. 
Mr Powell conceded that getting inflation under control would come at a cost to American households and businesses but he argued it was a price worth paying.
""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labour market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to household and businesses,"" he said. 
""These are unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.""
Mr Powell wants to avoid inflation becoming entrenched. Simply put, that means if people believe inflation will be high, they will alter their behaviour accordingly, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, someone who thinks prices will go up 3% next year is more likely to seek a 3% rise in wages.
me this happened, Mr Powell's predecessor, Paul Volcker, had to slam on the brakes, raising interest rates dramatically and sending the economy into recession. 
In March, the Federal Reserve's key interest rate was almost zero; it has since been raised to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% in an effort to tackle inflation."	/news/business-62695937
politics	Angela Rayner: I'm relaxed about the rich... if they pay tax	"Angela Rayner: I won't attack Sunak for being rich
Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner has admitted she is relaxed about people becoming ""filthy rich... as long as they pay their taxes"".
She said Labour wants people to ""create wealth"", echoing famous remarks made by the party's former spin doctor, Peter Mandelson.
Speaking to the BBC's Political Thinking podcast, Ms Rayner was asked about her views on wealth and class.
Asked if Labour believed in aspiration, she said: ""Absolutely, 100%.""
Her comments represent a shift away from the language used by Labour MPs and shadow ministers under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.
Launching Labour's campaign ahead of the general election in 2019, Mr Corbyn promised to ""pull down a corrupt system"" and make the UK's wealthy elite pay their way with new taxes.
In one tweet, the left-wing leader said ""there would be no billionaires and no one would live in poverty"" in a fair society.
But speaking to the BBC's Nick Robinson, Ms Rayner - who rose to Labour's front bench when Mr Corbyn was leader - struck a more pragmatic tone.
She was asked if she agreed with Lord Mandelson who, in 1998, said of New Labour: ""We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes.""
""If that means that they're going to be filthy rich as he [Lord Mandelson] says, I wouldn't use that term, but people are going to have great wealth,"" Ms Rayner said. ""It's about sharing that wealth and understanding where that wealth comes from.""
Ms Rayner said she would not be attacking new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for being rich. Mr Sunak - whose wife, Akshata Murty, is the daughter of an Indian billionaire - is thought to be one of the richest MPs in Parliament.
Being rich was not a problem for a prime minister, Ms Rayner said. But, she added, how he and his family had used that wealth was.
Ms Murty came under the spotlight earlier this year when her non-domiciled status was revealed, meaning she did not have to pay any tax on her earnings from outside the UK. She later agreed to pay UK taxes on her worldwide income.
""Don't preach to us if you're not paying your taxes and not doing the right thing,"" Ms Rayner said.
Putting the PM's wealth aside, Ms Rayner said Mr Sunak becoming the first prime minister of Asian heritage was a ""historic moment"" for the UK.
She said ""it wasn't the time and place"" for a tweet shared by Labour MP Nadia Whittome, who was ordered to delete a post saying Mr Sunak becoming prime minister ""isn't a win for Asian representation"".
""Sometimes it's nice to stop and look at something for what it is and say this is a good thing,"" Ms Rayner said.
Labour deputy leader - who has made a political point of her working-class roots - said her background has also often been brought up in a negative way.
She said: ""I get so much abuse from people, saying pregnant at 16, no qualifications. She must be thick. 
""Well, I'm clearly not thick because I wouldn't be where I am. I'm one of the most successful politicians of my generation, you know, my ability and my achievements have been, by any measure, have been as good as anybody else, whether privately educated or not, PhD or not. 
""So I'm not stupid. I think the more people can see talent not just in terms of you've got this academic qualification, the better it is.""
Nick Robinson's interview with Angela Rayner will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 17:30 BST on Saturday 29 October, and is also available on BBC Sounds and the Political Thinking website."	/news/uk-politics-63415681
business	Cost of living: Expanded energy bill discount scheme under way	"Households are starting to receive a larger rebate on their energy bill under the Warm Home Discount scheme but concerns remain for those missing out.
rebate was frozen at £140 for nearly a decade, but this winter it has increased to £150 and will be discounted automatically from bills.
Some pensioners and people on a low income receiving certain benefits are eligible for the discount.
But charities say some 500,000 households face missing out.
ude some people with disabilities and those in smaller homes who were previously entitled to the assistance.
government said it is prioritising those households that are most in need this winter.
Warm Home Discount has been in place in England, Wales and Scotland for some time to help people who might struggle to pay their heating bills during winter.
However, there was criticism of the system which required many people to apply to their energy company for the rebate. Those suppliers often provided the rebate on a first come, first served basis.
As energy bills started to rise, the government said the system would be reformed, extended and made more generous. Further promises of larger cost-of-living payments followed when the price of energy continued to soar.
Between now and March, £150 will automatically be taken off electricity bills by the vast majority of energy suppliers for anyone who is eligible. Those on prepayment meters may receive vouchers. In Scotland, some people who qualify through their benefits entitlement still have to apply to their supplier for the rebate.
How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch.
Some billpayers are receiving letters from their supplier to check eligibility, and a new helpline - 0800 107 8002 - is being launched.
About 2.8 million people are eligible, including:
f these groups has been reassessed and was part of a government consultation but charities have said that the results could leave thousands of people in serious difficulty.
government said that an additional 750,000 people would now qualify because they receive housing benefit, and the new system prioritised households that were most likely to struggle to heat their homes. 
However, charities National Energy Action (NEA) and Scope said that 500,000 households across England and Wales that were previously eligible will now be ruled out. 
use Disability Living Allowance and Personal Independence Payments are no longer qualifying benefits. People on low incomes, who do not receive means-tested benefits and who live in smaller, newer, houses, will also be among those losing out.
Adam Scorer, chief executive of NEA, said: ""Removing a £150 rebate from these vulnerable groups is unwelcome and an unnecessary change to a vital programme - especially during an energy crisis.""   
James Taylor, director of strategy at Scope, described the decision as ""shameful"" when disabled people were worried about the cost of running equipment such as breathing machines and powered wheelchairs. 
""Life costs a lot more when you're disabled. The government needs to provide more direct financial support now, not less, so disabled people don't freeze and starve this winter,"" he warned.
riteria differs in the various parts of Britain. The discount is not available in Northern Ireland, although some other grants may be provided to those finding it difficult to pay bills.
A statement from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We have introduced an unprecedented package of energy bills support for low-income households worth £1,200, as well as the £400 energy bill rebate and the Price Guarantee scheme, which will save the typical household around £700 this winter.
""On top of this, we are also prioritising households most in need this winter, with over three million homes across Great Britain receiving an additional £150 energy bill rebate through the Warm Home Discount, which will mean an extra 780,000 pensioners and low-income families will benefit this year compared to last.""
Warm Home Discount is different to the Winter Fuel Payment which is paid to pensioners by 13 January, and Cold Weather Payments when there are periods of freezing weather, or Winter Heating Payments in Scotland."	/news/business-63601302
sports	Winter Olympics: Eve Muirhead says curling gold in Beijing a 'dream come true'	"""It's a dream come true.""
At the fourth attempt, after heart-breaking near misses and career-saving surgery on an arthritic hip, Eve Muirhead finally has her Olympic curling gold medal.
""Without these girls being so strong, this dream would not have come true,"" said Muirhead, who was in tears on the podium.
""They helped me become a better curler, and a better person. 
""Together we are a very, very strong unit and I think today we proved that.""
Great Britain team of Muirhead, Vicky Wright, Jen Dodds and Hailey Duff overwhelmed Japan 10-3 in Sunday's final - a routine surge to victory compared with the twists and turns of the previous rounds, and with Muirhead's Olympic past.
After four defeats from nine in the group stage, GB only scraped into the semi-finals courtesy of other results going their way and the tiebreak of the 'draw shot challenge'.
In the last four they came through a gripping, stomach-churning match against Sweden - a win third time lucky for Muirhead, who had lost Olympic semi-finals in 2014 and 2018.
""Nobody likes to do it the easy way, do they? So we thought we would do it the tough way,"" the 31-year-old said. 
""As a team we showed a lot of resilience. We are very strong and very fit. And I think being physically fit helps you be mentally fit. 
""It shows that if you can be as strong at the beginning of a tournament as at the end of a tournament, then you have a good chance. 
""As a team, there were moments where you doubt yourself. You doubt whether you will make those play-offs, but we never gave up. We just didn't give up, and I think that shows the incredible strength of this team."" 
win emulates the gold secured by Great Britain 20 years earlier when Rhona Howie delivered her 'Stone of Destiny' in Salt Lake City.
Howie was in Beijing to witness the latest triumph as a BBC commentator and Muirhead credited her former coach, mentor and fellow Scot.
""It's funny because several months before I came here I was getting interviewed for a documentary about Rhona's 20-year anniversary,"" said Muirhead, who was 11 when Howie won gold.
""I remember saying in that, 'I would love to follow Rhona's footsteps. I would love to do what she did because I remember staying up watching it'.
""To have this moment now and know that I followed in Rhona's footsteps and have this gold medal around my neck, is something very, very special.
""I can't thank Rhona enough for all of her help and support through the years to help me get here.""
Muirhead, who became the youngest ever Olympic skip at just 19, had hip surgery in 2018 having played in pain for several years and admitted before the 2022 Games she had not known whether she would return to curling afterwards.
Her Scotland team only managed eighth at the World Championships last year, putting her Olympic place in jeopardy. 
Nine players were put into a squad selection process as a result of the disappointing finish but the current quartet, plus alternate Mili Smith, emerged.
Olympics has been 25-year-old Duff's first major global competition. Dodds has played 22 matches in Beijing after finishing fourth in the mixed doubles with men's skip Bruce Mouat, while Wright is a nurse who returned from her training to work full-time on the frontline during the Covid-19 pandemic.
""I was working full-time up until 2019 when I joined Eve's team,"" said Wright, who Muirhead described as the ""mother of the team"". 
""Then I dropped to one hour a week. Then the Covid pandemic hit in 2020, and I went back to work full-time.""
She was working on the wards alongside her training as recently as January before taking time off for the trip to China.
""I took eight weeks off, so it's back to work when I get back from here,"" she said.
""A week from today, I am back to work.""
While it may have been a disappointing Games for TeamGB overall - this gold and the silver won by the men's curlers on Saturday their only medals - the final day will live long in the memory of Muirhead and her rink.
""I'm so proud of the girls, how we played today, because if you can bring your A-game in the Olympic finals that just shows how great and what fantastic abilities we all have,"" Muirhead said.
""To stand on the podium and get that gold medal around your neck is honestly a moment I'll never forget."""	/sport/winter-olympics/60451924
entertainment	DCI Banks author Peter Robinson dies aged 72	"-selling crime author Peter Robinson has died at the age of 72, his publisher has confirmed.
Leeds-born novelist was known for the DCI Alan Banks series of books, set in Yorkshire.
ries were adapted into an ITV series with Stephen Tompkinson, which ran from 2011 to 2017.
His publisher said he had died after a short illness on Tuesday. Tributes have been paid by fellow crime writers Val McDermid and Ian Rankin.
Robinson emigrated to Canada in 1974 after studying English Literature at the University of Leeds.
He lived in Toronto with his wife Sheila Halladay.
He remained true to his roots by setting his DCI Banks novels, the first of which was published in 1987, in the fictional Yorkshire town of Eastvale.
ries has sold more than 8.75m books, his UK publisher Hodder & Stoughton said.
In 2020, he was granted the Grand Master Award from the Crime Writers of Canada, having previously been given their Derrick Murdoch Award in 2010.
His editor and managing editor of Hodder & Stoughton Carolyn Mays said he was a combination of ""all the best bits"" of his Alan Banks character.
""Thoughtful and passionate about justice, he had fine taste and a totally down-to-earth view of the world,"" she said.
Ms Mays said he had a wry and very dry humour and was a ""Yorkshireman to the core"".
""Much that he did was done without fanfare, like the scholarship he created at the University of Leeds, where he himself took his first degree, to sponsor students through an English literature and creative writing course.""
She said their hearts were with his family and friends and the ""many thousands of fans who will miss his work so much"".
""Most of all with his beloved wife Sheila, to whom he dedicated every single book he wrote.""
Ms Mays said his final work Standing in The Shadows was set to be published in March and was ""perhaps his finest work yet"".
Paying tribute on Twitter, author Val McDermid wrote: ""Sad to hear of the death of Inspector Banks.
""We were both first published in 1987, and our paths often crossed, (usually accompanied by beer) in Canada and his beloved Yorkshire. Condolences to Sheila.""
While Ian Rankin also paid tribute tweeting: ""Hellish news about my dear friend Peter Robinson. Spent many a wonderful evening in the company of him and his partner Sheila.""
rganisers of the Harrogate Crime Writing Festival also paid tribute to a ""wonderful author and guest"".
Robinson had appeared as a guest at the first festival 20 years ago.

technology	New FTX boss condemns crypto exchange's failure	"New FTX chief executive John Ray has hit out at the way the failed crypto exchange was run.
firm filed for bankruptcy in the US last week and, in court filings, Mr Ray said he had never ""seen such a complete failure of corporate controls"". 
Mr Ray, who replaced Sam Bankman-Fried, also criticised a ""complete absence of trustworthy financial information"".
Meanwhile, Mr Bankman-Fried has told the Vox news website that he regretted filing for bankruptcy.
He said that the decision had largely taken financial matters out of his control, and he also expressed his disdain for financial regulators.
Mr Ray said what he had found since taking over was ""unprecedented"" in his 40-year career, which includes overseeing the bankruptcy of US energy giant Enron.
In documents filed for the first day of bankruptcy proceedings at the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Mr Ray also criticised what he said were ""erratic and misleading"" public statements by his predecessor. 
Mr Ray said that FTX had concentrated control in the hands of a ""very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals"", and that it did not maintain centralised control of its cash.  
Instead, he said, there was an ""absence of an accurate list of bank accounts and account signatories"".
So far he said it had been possible to locate ""only a fraction of the digital assets"" held by the firm. 
Mr Ray's declaration to the court also says: ""In the Bahamas, I understand that corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors.""
w chief executive did add that there was ""a core team of dedicated employees"" who had stayed focused on their jobs since the bankruptcy.
He also noted some of the people most hurt by these events ""are current and former employees and executives, whose personal investments and reputations have suffered"".
FTX is estimated to owe  money to more than a million people and organisations.
It is unclear how much those with funds in the exchange will get back at the end of bankruptcy proceedings, though many experts warn it may be a small fraction of what they put into the firm.
Mr Bankman-Fried has recently tweeted: ""My goal - my one goal - is to do right by customers."""	/news/technology-63662396
health	Humza Yousaf warns strike action 'catastrophic' for Scotland's health service	"Scotland's health secretary has warned strike action by nurses would be ""catastrophic"" for the NHS.
Humza Yousaf said the industrial action backed by the country's largest nursing union was not inevitable and he wanted further talks on a new pay deal.
Mr Yousaf suggested there was scope to redistribute the existing £480m budget for NHS pay rises, but that no extra funding was available. 
Strike action is expected to start by the end of the year.
Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in Scotland have followed a number of other health unions in rejecting the Scottish government's revised pay offer.
RCN has said talks with health boards about deploying nurses in life-preserving services such as intensive care during any strike action are under way.
Speaking on BBC Good Morning Scotland , Mr Yousaf said there was a ""route through this"" and that ""strikes are not inevitable"".
He added: ""There will be continued dialogue, there will be continued negotiation with all the trade unions.
""What we can do is look at the £480m envelope and say well is there another way that could be distributed. 
""If the concern is coming from, for example, experienced nurses then is there something else we can do to redistribute that.""
On the impact of the strikes, Mr Yousaf said: ""I've got to be frank with you, even with all the contingency we can muster I think a strike will be harmful and I think it would catastrophic at this time more than any other time.""
Mr Yousaf also said there was a ""moral obligation"" on the UK government, who he said had created many of the cost of living pressures being felt by NHS workers, to provide more funding.  
most recent Scottish government pay offer was for a flat rate of £2,205 per person, backdated to April.
government says this is the biggest offer of its kind since devolution, representing an average salary increase of 7%, with the lowest paid gaining more than 11% and qualified nursing staff receiving up to 8.45%.
RCN has described the deal as a real-terms pay cut and accused the government of not listening to staff concerns. It asked for at least 5% above inflation, which rose to 10.1% in September.
RCN steward Hilary Nelson, who worked in an intensive care unit for 28 years, said the industrial action was about pay and safe staffing levels.
She told BBC Scotland: ""It is really difficult just now for nursing and those difficulties have emerged over many years. 
""When nurses are coming to work of an evening or morning they already know they are short-staffed.
""Whilst industrial action will be disruptive, we will do it safely, we will do it in a considered way and we will make sure we deliver our message to the government that enough is enough.
""If you do right by the nurses, you will do right by the patients.""
Members of the GMB and Unite unions, as well as the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, have also recently backed strike action.
But Unison, Scotland's largest health union, has suspended its strike ballot of NHS staff and is consulting its members on a revised pay offer until 14 November.
Once the result of this consultation is known then there will be more clarity on when any industrial action will take place as it is expected the trade unions will coordinate strikes.  "	/news/uk-scotland-63581710
business	Business energy prices to be cut by half expected levels	"Energy bills for UK businesses will be cut by around half their expected level this winter under a huge government support package.
me will fix wholesale gas and electricity prices for firms for six months from 1 October, shielding businesses from crippling costs.
Hospitals, schools and charities will also get help, the government said.
It comes after ministers announced a multi-billion pound plan to help households with bills for two years.
Analysts suggest the help for firms and households combined could cost up to £150bn.
Industry groups welcomed the package but warned further support may be needed after the winter.
It is understood the scheme will be reviewed after three months with an option to extend support for ""vulnerable businesses"" - but it is not known what sectors come under the category.
Wholesale prices, which are what suppliers pay for energy in bulk before they distribute it to customers, are expected to be fixed for all non-domestic energy customers at £211 per MWh for electricity and £75 per MWh for gas. 
rates will be the base cost, to which other add-ons, such as standing charges will be added by suppliers.
Independent analysts Cornwall Insight said the plan marked a ""substantial"" 45% discount on wholesale energy prices at the end of last week. 
government said the scheme would apply to companies which had agreed fixed deals at higher prices on or after 1 April, when energy bills started to surge. Those on variable and flexible tariffs will also be eligible.
Companies do not need to contact suppliers as the discount will automatically be applied to their bills, with savings seen from October but received from November.
Josh Farrant, manager at The Ye Olde Fleece Inn in Kendal, Cumbria, said the pub was facing a hike in energy bills from £44,000 to around £124,000 a year before the government's wholesale cap was announced.
""That some help is coming gives us a bit of hope,"" he said. ""But we are still massively going to have to look at the way we do things.""
""It doesn't mean the panic is over. It's going to run for six months, then we'll see.""
Guy Adams, who runs the Isle of Barra Beach Hotel in the Hebrides, said he had been quoted a 377% increase in his energy bills before the cap, which ""would probably have finished us off"".
""At present our cheapest room rate is £110 per night. We would have had to raise that to £415 per night,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.
However, he said because his seasonal hotel will close for the winter and reopen in May, it was ""absolutely impossible"" to set prices for bookings given the support package will only run until April.
""The fact that it is going to be reviewed in six months is not practical,"" he added.
Prime Minister Liz Truss said the government understood the ""huge pressure"" businesses, charities and public sector organisations faced with bills. She added that the new scheme would provide ""certainty and peace of mind"".
Bur Labour business spokesman Jonathan Reynolds said there were still questions about ""how much this will cost and who will pay for it"".
Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said the ""delayed announcement"" left businesses ""under a cloud of damaging uncertainty"". 
""The government have no plan beyond these next six months, paralysing businesses who need to make decisions for the long term,"" she added.
upport will apply to all non-domestic energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales. A scheme offering comparable support will be established in Northern Ireland.
Officials have not said how much the package will cost the taxpayer, but Cornwall Insight estimates it at around £25bn. 
Energy-intensive industries, such as steel-making, have warned that businesses could go bust due to their energy costs, which have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine.
Unlike households, businesses are not covered by an energy price cap, which is the maximum amount a supplier can charge per unit of energy. It means non-domestic bills have soared even higher.
government announced earlier this month that bills for a typical household would be limited to £2,500 annually until 2024 under a separate scheme.
On Wednesday, it also said:
g problem with this support for business is its shelf life. Few businesses plan with only a six-month time horizon and there will be some whose plans to cut production, close premises and let staff go will not change as a result of this intervention.  
But many others - particularly those in retail and hospitality - may see this giving them a fighting chance over the commercially crucial Christmas trading period.
government has thrown an emergency blanket over the economy this winter, but longer term, more fundamental reform to the energy supply market, its pricing and mechanics will be needed.
Developing more cheap renewables, securing foreign supplies of liquid gas, drilling for more domestic fossil fuels, breaking the link between gas prices and electricity and pushing ahead with hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and small and large scale nuclear have been part of the government's plan for nearly two years. 
What's new is the pressure applied by Vladimir Putin to do it as fast as possible. 
Stephen Phipson of Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said businesses would ""warmly welcome"" the government support package.
""Government has delivered a scheme which is simple to understand, giving reassurance to the business sector and making immediately available the much-needed help companies have been calling for across the board.""
However, he warned that energy prices were likely to remain high for more than six months and firms may need ""support for a longer period if we are to protect jobs and remain competitive"". 
Director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the price cap would give steelmakers ""the chance to get through the winter"". But he called on the government to ""rapidly reform the energy market to ensure longer-term competitive prices"".
Smaller businesses have also been struggling with rising bills, with brewery bosses warning that pubs and restaurants could be forced to close after energy costs soared by as much as 300%.
A landlord of one Essex pub told the BBC his energy bill had risen from about £13,000 a year to £35,000.
Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the industry was ""relieved"" by the support ahead of the busy Christmas trading period, adding it would secure jobs.

entertainment	Jet Black: 'Inspirational' drummer for the Stranglers dies aged 84	"Jet Black, the original drummer for 1970s and 80s punks The Stranglers, has died aged 84, the band has confirmed.
musician, who was born Brian Duffy, was a founding member of the Guildford group, playing on hits like Golden Brown, Peaches and No More Heroes.
He last performed with them in 2015, announcing his retirement a few years later due to ill health.
In a statement online, his ex-bandmates described him as an ""elder statesman"" of British music.
Bassist and co-frontman JJ Burnel said: ""After years of ill health, Jet has finally been released. He was a force of nature. An inspiration. 
""The Stranglers would not have been if it wasn't for him. The most erudite of men. A rebel with many causes.""
Sil Willcox, the band's manager, added: ""Jet Black was the real deal. Astute in business, a talented drummer and an obsessive perfectionist. 
""I will cherish the times we planned, pranked, ate, drank and laughed on so many great nights together.""
Stranglers, formed in Surrey in 1974, went on to became an integral part of the riotous UK punk and new wave scenes.
Despite the indolent, youthful rage associated with the genre, Black - a semi-professional drummer in the late 1950s and early 1960s - was, in fact, by then a successful businessman in his mid-30s.
He owned a fleet of ice cream vans and later an off-licence called The Jackpot and a home brewery. In the early days, the Stranglers used one of the vans as a tour bus and his shop as their headquarters.
Speaking to the band's official website in a 2010 interview, Black said he never doubted the decision to shift his focus away from business and back into music.
""Once I had made the decision, and then the commitment, I then pretty much burnt my bridges, there was no turning back,"" he said. ""I told myself that one way or another I was going to succeed. 
""Now, there were many, many problems, but my thoughts were focussed on how to solve them, not on questioning whether I had made the right decision.""
Black, who always rejected the term ""punk"" to describe his band, later told BBC Breakfast: ""We were on a mission to break all the rules and create something new and exciting; and that's what we've been doing for the past 40 years.
""We've developed a style of music that is very aggressive and exciting.""
Drummer Jet Black: ""We on a mission to break all the rules""
Supporting US punk stars the Ramones and Patti Smith at their UK gigs, The Stranglers' musical virtuosity set them apart from the more DIY aesthetic of their peers.
After original frontman Hugh Cornwell left in 1990, the band continued touring and recording. According to Cornwell's autobiography, when he phoned Black to announce his resignation, the drummer's response was simply ""OK, fine"".
On Thursday, Cornwell paid tribute to Black, noting how they had ""shared a special period"" of their lives together, achieving their dreams of becoming musicians.
""We were immediately drawn to one another, he had a singular sense of purpose that I identified with,"" wrote Cornwell. ""He threw everything in his previous life out, to dedicate himself to our common goal.""
Adding: ""The Stranglers success was founded on his determination and drive... His timing was faultless.""
In 2007, the band announced that Black was suffering with heart issues and he took a step back from performing, being temporarily replaced by his drum technician.
He resumed his duties full-time for the band's tours in 2010 and 2011, but the following year he was taken to hospital after falling ill just before he was due on stage in Oxford.
musician, who had suffered respiratory issues since childhood, began to restrict his live work to the UK, although he vowed to ""carry on until I'm incapable of doing it"".
Despite difficulties in performing towards the end of his career, he remained a fan favourite. Audiences would often chant his name as he took his place behind the kit, until he finally retired in 2015.
Black wrote several books chronicling his time in the band - most notably The Stranglers' infamous 1980 arrest in Nice, France, where they had allegedly incited a riot (they also famously clashed with members of the Clash, Sex Pistols and Ramones, as well as journalists).
An enthusiastic furniture designer, he also patented the Jet Black Power Bass Drum Pedal.
When asked how he would like be remembered by the band's website in 2010, Black replied: ""I guess if we are actually remembered, then that will do.""
In a statement, his representative confirmed the musician had passed away ""peacefully"" on Tuesday 6 December at his country home in Wales.
He leaves behind his wife Ava, and his two children Charlotte and Anthony. 
Black's death comes two years after The Stranglers' keyboard player Dave Greenfield died at the age of 71 after testing positive for coronavirus.
Greenfield, originally from Brighton, had contracted the virus following a prolonged stay in hospital for heart problems."	/news/entertainment-arts-63904248

It is more than double the first-day figure for the latest series of The Crown, and the same number as watched BBC One's EastEnders on Thursday.
first three episodes in the duke and duchess's highly-publicised six-part series became available on Netflix at 08:00 GMT.
As well as the 2.4 million viewers for the first instalment, episode two had 1.5 million viewers on the first day, and the third part attracted 800,000.
mpares with 1.1 million people who saw the first episode of the fifth series of royal drama The Crown - which features a fictionalised version of a younger Harry - on its launch day last month.
Barb's figures only include people watching Netflix on TV sets.
On traditional TV channels on Thursday, BBC One's The One Show also attracted 2.4 million, ITV soap Coronation Street was watched by 3.5 million, and the most-watched programmes of the day were the BBC News At Six and subsequent regional news, both with 4.1 million.
Netflix's viewing model is more geared to longer-term viewing than traditional TV channels, and series like Harry & Meghan and The Crown will be watched over a longer period, rather than the audience tuning in on the same day.
Harry & Meghan includes interviews with the couple and their friends, as well as their video diary - covering a range of topics, including their difficult relationship with the press and the Royal Family's response to racist articles about Meghan.
Harry said some members of the family felt a negative experience with the media was ""a rite of passage"".
""Some of the members of the family were like, 'My wife had to go through that, so why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment? Why should she be protected?""'
""I said, 'The difference here is the race element'.""
Harry also said how proud he was that his children are mixed race, and that it makes him want to ""make the world a better place for them"".

technology	TikTok profits from livestreams of families begging	"WATCH: Mona Ali Al-Karim says she and her daughters beg for money to pay for hospital treatment
Displaced families in Syrian camps are begging for donations on TikTok while the company takes up to 70% of the proceeds, a BBC investigation found.
Children are livestreaming on the social media app for hours, pleading for digital gifts with a cash value.
BBC saw streams earning up to $1,000 (£900) an hour, but found the people in the camps received only a tiny fraction of that.
kTok said it would take prompt action against ""exploitative begging"".
mpany said this type of content was not allowed on its platform, and it said its commission from digital gifts was significantly less than 70%. But it declined to confirm the exact amount.
Earlier this year, TikTok users saw their feeds fill with livestreams of families in Syrian camps, drawing support from some viewers and concerns about scams from others.
In the camps in north-west Syria, the BBC found that the trend was being facilitated by so-called ""TikTok middlemen"", who provided families with the phones and equipment to go live.
middlemen said they worked with agencies affiliated to TikTok in China and the Middle East, who gave the families access to TikTok accounts. These agencies are part of TikTok's global strategy to recruit livestreamers and encourage users to spend more time on the app.
Since the TikTok algorithm suggests content based on the geographic origin of a user's phone number, the middlemen said they prefer to use British SIM cards. They say people from the UK are the most generous gifters. 
Mona Ali Al-Karim and her six daughters are among the families who go live on TikTok every day, sitting on the floor of their tent for hours, repeating the few English phrases they know: ""Please like, please share, please gift.""
Mona's husband was killed in an airstrike and she is using the livestreams to raise money for an operation for her daughter Sharifa, who is blind.
gifts they're asking for are virtual, but they cost the viewers real money and can be withdrawn from the app as cash. Livestream viewers send the gifts - ranging from digital roses, costing a few cents, to virtual lions costing around $500 - to reward or tip creators for content.
For five months, the BBC followed 30 TikTok accounts broadcasting live from Syrian camps for displaced people and built a computer program to scrape information from them, showing that viewers were often donating digital gifts worth up to $1,000 an hour to each account.
Families in the camps said they were receiving only a tiny fraction of these sums, however.
With TikTok declining to say how much it takes from gifts, the BBC ran an experiment to track where the money goes.
A reporter in Syria contacted one of the TikTok-affiliated agencies saying he was living in the camps. He obtained an account and went live, while BBC staff in London sent TikTok gifts worth $106 from another account.
At the end of the livestream, the balance of the Syrian test account was $33. TikTok had taken 69% of the value of the gifts.
kTok influencer and ex-professional rugby player Keith Mason donated £300 ($330) during one family's livestream and encouraged his nearly one million followers to do the same.
When told by the BBC that most of these funds were taken by the social media company, he said it was ""ridiculous"" and ""unfair"" to families in Syria. 
""You've got to have some transparency. To me, that's very greedy. It's greed,"" he said.
$33 remaining from the BBC's $106 gift was reduced by a further 10% when it was withdrawn from the local money transfer shop. TikTok middlemen would take 35% of the remainder, leaving a family with just $19.
Hamid, one of the TikTok middlemen in the camps, told the BBC he had sold his livestock to pay for a mobile phone, SIM card and wi-fi connection to work with families on TikTok.
He now broadcasts with 12 different families, for several hours a day.
Hamid said he uses TikTok to help families make a living. He pays them most of the profits, minus his running costs, he said.
Like the other middlemen, Hamid said he was supported by ""live agencies"" in China, who work directly with TikTok.
""They help us if we have any problems with the app. They unlock blocked accounts. We give them the name of the page, the profile picture, and they open the account,"" Hamid said.
Hamid helps families go on TikTok live. Watch how the BBC investigated TikTok's commission from digital gifts
Agencies like these, known as ""livestreaming guilds"" and based all around the world, are contracted by TikTok to help content creators produce more appealing livestreams. 
kTok pays them a commission according to the duration of livestreams and the value of gifts received, the agencies told the BBC. 
mphasis on duration means TikTokers, including children in the Syrian camps, go live for hours at a time.
Marwa Fatafta, from digital rights organisation Access Now, says these livestreams run contrary to TikTok's own policies to ""prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation"" of minors on the platform.
kTok Begging in Syria
BBC News investigates a new trend on TikTok - hundreds of families in camps for displaced people in Syria, begging for gifts on TikTok livestreams.
Watch on BBC News Channel Sunday 02:30 or on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)
""TikTok clearly states that users are not allowed to explicitly solicit gifts, so this is a clear violation of their own terms of services, as well as the rights of these people,"" she said.
She acknowledges that people have the right to share their stories online ""to try to seek support and sympathy"", but she says these livestreams ""lack dignity, and are humiliating"".
kTok's rules say you must have 1,000 followers before you can go live, you must not directly solicit for gifts and must ""prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation"" of minors on the platform.
But when the BBC used the in-app system to report 30 accounts featuring children begging, TikTok said there had been no violation of its policies in any of the cases.
After the BBC contacted TikTok directly for comment, the company banned all of the accounts.
It said in a statement: ""We are deeply concerned by the information and allegations brought to us by the BBC, and have taken prompt and rigorous action. 
""This type of content is not allowed on our platform, and we are further strengthening our global policies around exploitative begging.""
kTok, the world's fastest-growing social media app, has made more than $6.2bn in gross revenue from in-app spending since its launch in 2017, according to analytics company Sensor Tower.
BBC approached several charities working in Syria to support families in the camps as an alternative to making money on TikTok Live.
A local charity Takaful Alsham said it would provide basic supplies to the families for the next three months, helping the children find schools and covering their educational expenses.
But for many in the camps, there are few options to make money other than begging online. Hundreds of families continue to go live every day, and most of the money donated is still going to TikTok.

business	California says Amazon's dominance drives up online prices	"f California has accused Amazon of violating competition law with practices that prevent sellers from offering lower prices elsewhere.
wsuit from America's most populous state says the moves have hurt rivals and made online shopping more expensive for everyone.
It marks the biggest legal threat Amazon has faced in the US. 
But a similar lawsuit was dismissed in the US earlier this year for insufficient evidence of higher prices.
Proving harm to consumers in the form of higher prices is a key issue in US competition law. 
Amazon said that like the DC case, California's complaint had it ""exactly backwards"" and that the lawsuit should be dismissed.
""Sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store,"" the company said. ""Amazon takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices across the broadest selection, and like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively.""
In the complaint, California says Amazon's contracts require sellers to offer the lowest price on Amazon, restraining the ability of other websites to compete. 
By protecting Amazon's dominance of the market, the deals give the firm freedom to raise fees on merchants, which eventually hit consumers in the form of higher prices.
""Amazon knows its price parity agreements prevent rivals from stealing market share away with lower prices reflective of their lower fees. So Amazon keeps raising fees, leading to higher prices on Amazon, leading to higher prices off Amazon due to price parity,"" the lawsuit says.
It said this created ""a vicious anticompetitive cycle in which Amazon wins and its third-party sellers, its wholesale suppliers, consumers, and competition lose"".
wsuit also accuses Amazon of punishing merchants who run afoul of the rules, with tactics such as moving their listings lower in search results,
""The reality is: Many of the products we buy online would be cheaper if market forces were left unconstrained,"" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.
ugh the lawsuit is limited to California, its effect could be far-reaching given California's size. 
wsuit comes as regulators, especially in the European Union, increasingly question the dominance of a handful tech giants.
ummer Amazon sought to settle a case brought by the EU which accused it of using data it collects on sellers to compete against them. 
Amazon is also under investigation in the UK over concerns that the company is giving an unfair advantage to certain sellers on its marketplace.
Meanwhile an EU court this week also largely upheld a record fine against Google for using the Android platform to cement its search engine's dominance."	/news/business-62908412
entertainment	Hugh Jackman: Wolverine star on mental health problems	"Actor Hugh Jackman has said he was ""a hot mess"" making his latest film, The Son.
54-year-old X-Men star explained: ""I certainly realised how vulnerable I was.""
He plays a successful lawyer with a teenage son (Zen McGrath) from a previous marriage who is suffering from depression. 
Jackman told the BBC the subject matter of the film and returning to acting after not working during Covid lockdowns caused him ""anxiety"". 
And then his father died while he was making the movie.
""My father actually never missed a day of work in his life,"" Jackman says, explaining why he did not take any time off to grieve. ""I did imagine what my father would say and he would say, 'Go to work'."" 
Nonetheless, making The Son was hard and the pressure took its toll.
""I would be one of the least [likely] people I know who I'd describe as a hot mess, but I certainly was during this.""
Jackman suffered sleepless nights while playing the role of Peter, a workaholic with a new partner, young baby, an ex-wife and their troubled teenage son. The star says he continues to consult a therapist who helped him through filming. 
film's producers also employed psychiatrists on set in case members of the cast and crew needed to talk about the upsetting material. 
""This was the first time I'd ever seen such a thing on a film,"" says Jackman, ""and people used it and it was necessary.""
While intimacy coaches have become commonplace when sex scenes are being filmed, Jackman advocates mental health support as well. 
""There's a little part of the old school part of my brain [that thinks], 'Well, that's up to you to work out.' If you need to go to a doctor, for whatever reason, your foot, your mental health, you know, you work that out.
""But I think it certainly would be a sign from an employer that we understand taking care of the whole person, not just paying them, but taking care of their wellbeing in all forms is really, really important."" 
See-Saw films, which produced The Son, worked with the Film and TV Charity, which has developed a free industry-wide resource to destigmatise poor mental health in film and TV.
rity's 2021 Looking Glass survey found that nine in 10 people working in the sector had experienced a mental health problem.
Whole Picture Toolkit offers guidance and advice on supporting mental health and wellbeing on set and pre and post-production and, so far, the kit has been adopted by 35 productions. 
Jackman says he hopes The Son will spark conversations around mental health issues ""that are urgently needed"".  
He says: ""There is a real lack of knowledge and ignorance and shame around the subject and I think it's something we need to confront, really, really quickly.""
film, which explores absentee parenting and the effects of divorce on children as well as adolescent mental illness, is tough to watch. 
While The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised the ""beautifully composed and literate drama"", not everyone was a fan of The Son, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival and opens in the UK in February. 
Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney said it was ""a depressing film about depression, while The Times' Kevin Maher dismissed it as ""a wearily predicable slab of family values hokum.""
However, Jackman has already received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor for his role in the drama.
It comes at a moment when some are questioning the future of gendered acting categories in awards ceremonies.
Jackman says he's a ""a big fan"" of having one gender neutral acting category in which all performers compete. 
""That would be a really positive step. I don't understand why it's split into just two genders when we all know it's a much bigger spectrum.""
Acknowledging that he ""might have just shot myself in the foot"" as his own chances of winning would be halved if there was one non-binary acting category instead of separate best actor and actress categories, he adds: ""Whatever the mix is, we should maybe just break down any of those categories that end up being divisive and unnecessary."" 
If the past is anything to go by, Jackman could be in with a shout of taking home an award this season. The Son was co-written and directed by Florian Zeller, who directed the 2020 drama The Father, which earned its star Sir Anthony Hopkins his second Oscar. 
Sir Anthony, famous for his roles in The Silence of the Lambs, the Thor movies and Westworld, makes a cameo appearance in The Son.
And Jackman gives a fascinating insight into how Sir Anthony continues to work after more than six decades on screen. 
""He shot for one day. He spent six months emailing the director Florian every single day. Florian said to me, 'I got as many emails about this one scene in a movie as I did for The Father, where he is in every scene.' He takes it so seriously.""
And that meticulous approach continued on set. 
""At one point, he wanted to redo his close-up again. And I pulled Florian aside and I said: 'But what he did was so incredible.' 
""And he said: 'Oh yeah, I've got everything I need, but I think he just misses acting. He hadn't acted for 18 months. I think he just misses it, he wanted another go.'"" 
Son represents a departure for Jackman, who played Wolverine in nine blockbuster films - and is coming back for at least one more. 
He also made his name in movie musicals, including Les Misérables and The Greatest Showman and on Broadway, where he is currently starring in The Music Man. So how does he pick roles?
""I'm always looking for things that I haven't done before, that challenge me, that scare me,"" Jackman says.
""And by the way, when I did Wolverine, it always scared me, too. That's a million miles away from who I am as well."" "	/news/entertainment-arts-63985715
business	UK inflation rises at fastest rate for 40 years as food costs jump	"Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years with food costs, particularly for bread, cereal and meat, climbing.
UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, edged up to 9.1% in the 12 months to May, from 9% in April, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Fuel and energy prices are the biggest drivers of inflation, but the ONS said food costs had pushed it up further.
Workers and unions are pushing for pay rises to cope with higher prices.
But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"" where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers through higher prices.
Currently, inflation is at the highest level since March 1982, when it also stood at 9.1% and the Bank of England has warned it will reach 11% this year.
Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs £1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%.
In a BBC-commissioned survey of more than 4,000 people, 82% said they thought their wages should increase to match the rising price of goods and services.
Households were hit by an unprecedented £700-a-year increase in energy costs in April, and fuel price rises in June mean it costs more than £100 to fill an average family car with petrol.
Rail workers walked out on Tuesday causing severe disruption, with further strikes planned for Thursday and Saturday in a dispute over pay, jobs and conditions.
Rail, Maritime and Transport union is calling for a pay rise of 7%, while employers have offered a maximum of 3%.
Unison, which represents public sector workers, accused ministers of ""living on another planet"" over ""talks of public sector pay restraint"".
""Under-pressure health, care, school and council services desperately need staff to be given a pay boost that matches runaway prices,"" assistant general secretary Jon Richards said.
ggest teachers' union is also warning of potential industrial action over pay.
National Education Union has criticised government proposals for a 3% pay increase for most teachers in England, and called for an ""inflation-plus increase for all teachers"".
But Dominic Raab told the BBC's Today programme: ""We have got to stop making the problem worse by fuelling pay demands that will only see inflation stay higher for longer and that only hurts the poorest the worst.""
ONS said rising prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages helped fuel inflation in May.
Russia's war in Ukraine has severely restricted wheat and maize supplies, which are used to make bread and cereals, from two of the world's biggest exporters.
Ukraine is also a major producer of sunflower oil, meaning the costs of alternatives have also climbed.
Market research firm Kantar has forecast that the average annual grocery bill in the UK is set to rise by £380 this year.
Supermarket Asda told the BBC some shoppers are setting £30 limits at checkouts and petrol pumps, with customers putting less in their baskets and switching to budget ranges.
Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said ""widespread food price rises"" meant the cost of goods leaving factories had risen at their fastest rate in 45 years in May, with the cost of raw materials at the highest on record.
But he said the steep rises in food and record high petrol prices in May had been stemmed by the price of clothes rising less than they did this time last year, along with a drop in computer game costs.
ONS also revealed average UK house prices increased by 12.4% in the year to April, with average prices now £281,000, £31,000 higher than this time last year.
Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, said after families paid for essentials, ""the amount of spare cash left over to spending on days out, socialising and other treats is shrinking at an astonishing rate"".
Mum Georgia, from Birmingham, said she was having to cut back on trips with her daughter Harper-Faye as a result of prices rises.
""I haven't got the money to go to Sea Life Centres and stuff. That's like, £25 a ticket,"" said she said. ""I can't go out as much as I used to, not a chance. I can't afford it.""
Responding to the latest inflation rate, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was ""using all the tools at our disposal to bring inflation down and combat rising prices"".
government has provided a  package of measures, worth £15bn in total, to help people cope with soaring prices.
But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor said the country needed ""more than sticking plasters to get us back on course - we need a stronger, and more secure economy"". 
Liberal Democrat treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine called for a cut in VAT, adding: ""This chancellor has hiked taxes time and time again, refusing to slash them to help with the cost of living emergency.""
re's no respite from the relentless rise in prices. While at least the rate of rise in inflation appears to have slowed, this is just a pause for breath. Further records in petrol prices and a renewed surge in the price of internationally traded gas after a fire at a key US gas terminal, mean a hot summer, and tricky autumn.
Right now we are also seeing the impact of a notable fall in sterling, compounding the global inflationary pressures, and helping to explain why UK inflation is higher than the rest of the G7.
Inflation this high is disastrous for the personal finances of millions of households, especially as food prices are unarguably surging. ""Squeeze"" doesn't quite capture how some working families are seeing their entire disposable income wiped out by monthly energy direct debits, or turning up at supermarkets asking the cashiers to stop the till at £30 or £40.
Bank of England may not see this data as a reason to ""act forcefully"" which many see as code for a half a per cent rise in August. They will continue to watch the evolution of wage settlements. While there is little evidence of a spiral in wages and prices so far, it is clear we are at a critical moment for the jobs market. 
With vacancies at record levels, unions see a one-off opportunity to increase wages, and will continue to push for double digit rises, for example rejecting Rolls Royce's £2,000 cost of living payment. Employers including the government will resist, but workers may find some wind in their sails in negotiations.
One way to try to control how fast prices are rising is to raise interest rates. The aim of this is to increase the cost of borrowing and encourage people to borrow and spend less, and save more.
In a bid to stem the pace of soaring prices, the Bank of England recently increased UK interest rates from 1% to 1.25%.

business	Airlines told to cancel flights to stop travel chaos	"UK airlines have been told to cancel flights they can't deliver this summer to stop a rerun of May's travel chaos. 
government and the aviation regulator wrote to carriers on Tuesday telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable"".
rlier cancellations were ""better"" than axing flights at the last minute.
It comes after tens of thousands of passengers have been affected by cancellations and delays at airports.
roblem was particularly bad during Easter and last month's half-term school holiday, and British Airways, TUI and Easyjet have apologised. 
Staff shortages have been blamed, after thousands of airline jobs were cut during the pandemic and have yet to be replaced despite a spike in post-pandemic travel demand. 
In their joint letter, the Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority set out five ""specific expectations"" for the sector.
wrote: ""We think it's important that each airline reviews afresh its plans for the remainder of the summer season until the end of September to develop a schedule that is deliverable.
""Your schedules must be based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available, and should be resilient for the unplanned and inevitable operational challenges that you will face.
""While cancellations at any time are a regrettable inconvenience to passengers, it is our view that cancellations at the earliest possibility to deliver a more robust schedule are better for consumers than late notice on-the-day cancellations.""
r stated that airlines must ""keep consumers informed"" about their rights during disruption, such as having ""sufficiently staffed call centres and user-friendly digital channels"".
It also urged airlines, ground handlers, air traffic control and the Border Force work more closely to try to prevent problems. 
Airlines and unions told MPs on the Commons Business Committee on Tuesday that the staffing shortages blighting the industry were likely to persist this summer.
Oliver Richardson, national officer for civil air transport at the Unite union, told MPs it was unlikely the situation would be fixed ""unless we work together"". 
Representatives from BA, Easyjet and ground handling firm Swissport said they also faced long delays to get security clearance for new staff. 
Swissport's UK boss, Jude Winstanley, said it had hired 3,000 people since the start of the year, but it was taking up to 90 days to get them a full airside pass due to the referencing process.
According to the CAA, up to 4% of UK flights were cancelled during half term and the Platinum Jubilee weekend - up from the usual rate of 1%. 
Boss Richard Moriarty called the situation distressing and unacceptable, adding that the industry needed to get a grip - although he said it was ""not solely a UK specific issue"".
re have been calls for EU aviation workers to be added to the government's shortage occupation list, but aviation minister Robert Courts denied this would help.
He told the committee that EU HGV drivers - another industry facing shortages - had been offered up to 5,000 visas to fill gaps in the UK, and only 27 had come forward.
""If there were spare workers in Europe they would be in Schiphol [Amsterdam airport],"" he said.

Strikes are planned for some nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 15 and 20 December.

sports	Amir Albazi: Iraqi MMA fighter dreams of becoming first Arab UFC champion	"Amir Albazi's journey to become the first Iraqi man fighting for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may have been tougher than any of his bouts to date.
rising talent in professional mixed martial arts (MMA) was born in Baghdad but grew up in Sweden, after his family fled Iraq to escape Saddam Hussein's authoritarian regime.
Albazi arrived in the Nordic country as a boy who could not speak a word of Swedish - and he experienced severe culture shock in his new surroundings.
""In school, I couldn't understand what people were saying, but I could tell they were making fun of me,"" he told the BBC. 
""The only way I could express myself was with my fists.""
29-year-old said his world was transformed when, by chance, he found MMA on TV. It was love at first sight.
MMA combines techniques from different disciplines of martial arts, including kickboxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing and wrestling.
rt was conceived in the early 1990s as a way to find the best combat style. It now boasts millions of fans worldwide, and the UFC is its biggest promoter.
Albazi immediately sought the nearest gym in Stockholm where he could learn the sport.
At the time, MMA was viewed as too brutal for adolescents, so the young refugee could only train in jiu-jitsu, a martial art based on ground fighting and submission holds.
rt gave him confidence and steered him away from the troubles that surrounded him in the tough Stockholm suburb of Bredang.
He won several major jiu-jitsu titles as a teenager and travelled around Europe for MMA bouts, lying about his age so he would be let into the cage.
He moved to London to study sports science and then relocated to Las Vegas, where the UFC is based.
As a professional, Albazi is known by his ring name, ""The Prince"" - a translation of his Arabic first name.
He now has almost 15 years of experience in the sport and wants to become the first Iraqi and Arab champion in the UFC's history. 
""I feel a great responsibility on my shoulders being the only Iraqi in the UFC. I feel as if I am representing my country and the whole Arab world,"" he said.
Albazi competes in the flyweight weight category (53-57kg; 116-125lbs) and boasts an impressive record of 15 wins and only one loss, with the majority of his victories coming by way of choke holds.
He will next appear in the ring in Las Vegas on 17 December to face Alessandro Costa of Brazil.
""My plan is the same as always. I will take him down, wear him out and get the choke,"" he said.
Albazi explained that he eventually plans to return to Iraq and develop MMA there.
""All Iraqis are champions at heart, so it will come naturally for them. All they need is the support and facilities to train,"" he said.
Following his last UFC win, Albazi met with the spokesman of the Iraqi military to discuss ways to evolve the sport.
His dream is to inspire a generation of young athletes in the Arab world - just as the Russian fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov and the Cameroonian star Francis Ngannou have done elsewhere.
Despite growing up abroad, Albazi has remained close to his culture, and always enters fights with the Iraqi flag draped over his shoulders.
""Many Arabs in the West shy away from their heritage, but it should be the opposite,"" he said. ""Arab traditions and values make me who I am and give me strength.""
In a recent documentary, he extolled the health benefits of pacha, a traditional dish made from slow-boiled sheep heads and other innards.
Albazi credits much of his success to his Islamic faith.
""I have seen many of the top fighters stressed before they fight. Because of my belief in God I always remain calm. I know everything has been written for me,"" he said.
But his work ethic also helps him excel, he said. ""My whole career if people did 10 reps, I would stay after training and do extra,"" he said. 
""I have never been talented, the strongest, the smartest... I was stubborn."""	/news/world-middle-east-63993032

health	'NHS is broken' say striking ambulance staff in West	"Ambulance workers in the West are striking in a dispute over pay and working conditions.
Picket lines have formed in Bristol, Somerset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire on Wednesday.
Disruption is expected to be extensive and NHS leaders have warned that patient safety is at risk.
Ambulances will be responding to life-threatening situations but people are asked to only call 999 in life-threatening situations.
Paramedics, control room staff and support workers, who are members of the Unison, GMB and Unite unions, are striking across much of England and Wales.
Unions representing ambulance workers want pay increases to keep up with the rising cost of living. They have not set a specific figure but argue any offer needs to be high enough to prevent a recruitment crisis.
However, ministers say they will not negotiate on pay as they have met independent pay recommendations.
Chris Hewett, paramedic and Unison member, was at the picket line in Filton. He said: ""It's been a relatively quiet morning, we're at a third of our normal 999 level.
""So it means the public are supporting us and looking after themselves and find other ways of caring themselves other than calling 999.""
Wednesday's strike comes after South Western Ambulance Service declared a critical incident on Tuesday, after they had more than 700 calls waiting to be dispatched. 
Mr Hewett said: ""When I came on shift yesterday there were over 750 999 calls that we had not been able to get ambulances to across the region. 
""That's a normal day - it's quieter today because people are aware of the strike but it shows that the NHS is broken and the ambulance service is crippled by a lack of funding and a real recruitment and retention crisis.""
rmed forces have been drafted in to help manage any impact of today's strike with about two dozen army medics brought in to help South Western Ambulance Service, according to Mr Hewett. 
ramedic said wages have gone down 20 per cent in real terms and Unison members were prepared to keep going with strike action. 
""What we're saying to people, if they need us, then dial 999 and someone will come and help,"" he said.
NHS bosses in Somerset have also warned today services are under ""extreme pressure"" not just due to strikes but due to a combination of cold weather, concerns about Strep A infections, and an increase in Flu.
Bernie Marden, chief medical officer, NHS Somerset said: ""Regardless of any industrial action taking place, it is important that patients who need urgent medical care continue to come forward.""
Connor Calby, a paramedic who works across Bristol and Somerset said to BBC Radio Bristol that staff were struggling to pay their energy bills and with the wider cost of living crisis. 
Unison member said staff had been put in a ""very difficult"" position over striking.
He said: ""We all joined this profession because we wanted to make a difference to people and make sure they got the best care and none of us took it lightly.
""In the South West 85.6 per cent of us were in favour of strike action and I think that says volumes about how everyone feels at the moment."" 
Chris Nelson, Gloucestershire Police and Crime Commissioner said the sheer demand on the ambulance services has led to resources being lost from police. 
He said: ""Over the last six months we have had a lot more involvement with NHS-related issues where our partners can't meet their demand. 
""On average we have 50 or so calls a day in the force control room about ambulance-related issues to do with concerns for welfare.""
Mr Nelson gave an example of an incident last week where police had to convey an elderly man to hospital after a fall on the ice which left him with a suspected hip and leg injury. The waiting time for an ambulance to arrive was estimated to be six hours. 
Four police units, meaning at least four officers but possibly eight, attended along with and a fire unit which could have had four to five fire officers.
Police and the fire officers spent two hours asking for an ambulance to attend, Mr Nelson said. 
Eventually they took the man to hospital on a stretcher at the request of ambulance service but were then turned away from Cheltenham Hospital and told to go to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. 
Mr Nelson added he was ""sympathetic"" to those striking over low pay.
Further strike action is planned on 28 December and concerns have been raised over its impact considering it comes after four bank holidays. 
Not all unions are striking for the same hours of Wednesday. And it is difficult to say how many workers are striking at each individual service. In some areas, such as the East of England, there is no current plan to strike.

sports	Keegan Brown: Players Championship winner 'buzzing' for return to Alexandra Palace	"Keegan Brown says he is ""buzzing"" to return to the PDC World Darts Championship after failing to qualify last year.
30-year-old won a Players Championship event in August and believes he is back on track.
""The difference has been practising,"" Brown told BBC South Today. 
""The last couple of years where I've been working at St Mary's Hospital my darts has come second and it's been really noticeable at competitions.""
Brown, from the Isle of Wight, will make his seventh appearance on darts' biggest stage when he steps up to the oche at Alexandra Palace next week.
He will take on Germany's Florian Hempel in round one on Friday, 16 December.
His best result at the competition was in 2018 where he progressed to the last 16.
""Every single darts player on the PDC Tour, all they want, is to qualify for Ally Pally and I'm over the moon to qualify for it this year,"" the world number 64 said.
""I felt absolutely awful when I missed out in 2021 so I made myself watch every single game to make myself realise how much I missed it.""
Following the disappointment Brown decided he needed to find more time to train if he were to rediscover his form.
He started throwing more regularly in his spare room at home which he has transformed into a darts room with a board and his trophies to remind him of past successes.
""Being a part of the NHS the last couple of years has been tough especially the first six or eight months of the pandemic,"" he added.
""I think between March and August I only picked up my darts about seven times and playing was definitely on the backburner.
""But going to work keeps me grounded and I enjoy my job. It gives me balance. I go to work to work and now I come home to practice darts.
""I made sure I practiced enough this year and so far the results have gone my way.""
Brown's hard graft paid off when he won the ProTour's Players Championship 23 in Barnsley over the summer to claim his first pro title in seven years.
It was a big moment for the part-time NHS blood lab worker who firmly re-established himself in the sport.
""I think we've had at least two or three prime ministers between my last two wins,"" he said.
""Seven years is a long time without a trophy but hopefully another comes soon. It shows that the game of darts is a marathon and not a sprint.
""Practice is going well heading into Ally Pally so it's literally in my hands.
""The atmosphere there is always second to none with 5,500 people chanting and cheering you on it's almost as good as a Christmas present - I'm buzzing for it."""	/sport/darts/63887920
technology	Missing Cryptoqueen: Is Dr Ruja Ignatova the biggest Bitcoin holder?	"With crypto markets in turmoil, files seen by the BBC suggest an unlikely Bitcoin investor may have also lost a fortune -  ""the missing cryptoqueen"", Dr Ruja Ignatova. 
mmer disappeared in 2017 as her cryptocurrency OneCoin was at its height - attracting billions from investors. Fraud and money-laundering charges in the US have led to her becoming one of the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives.
Oxford-educated entrepreneur told investors she had created the ""Bitcoin killer"", but the files suggest she secretly amassed billions in her rival currency before she disappeared.
Details first surfaced in 2021 in leaked documents from Dubai's courts, posted online by a lawyer who crowned Dr Ruja - as she's known - the ""most successful criminal in history"".
A new book and upcoming episodes of BBC podcast The Missing Cryptoqueen investigate how Dr Ruja has stayed hidden - and whether this alleged crypto-hoard might help explain it.
We have been able to independently verify some - but not all - of the information in the Dubai files. 
At the very least, the leak suggests Dubai was an important financial route for Dr Ruja, something the FBI alluded to in naming the United Arab Emirates as one of five countries she has known connections to.
""You've got hundreds of millions of dollars at stake here,"" said Dr Jonathan Levy, the lawyer who first posted the files online, and who is relying on information from them in a compensation claim for OneCoin victims.
m was lodged with the Supreme Court of the British Indian Ocean Territory, chosen because it hosted a web domain allegedly used by OneCoin.  
Dr Levy received thousands of documents, mostly in Arabic, from a whistleblower who he said thought it was wrong that people were being ""unjustly enriched"" in Dubai.
most tantalising claim made in Dr Levy's legal case is that a massive Bitcoin deal was struck with an Emirati royal, Sheikh Saoud bin Faisal Al Qassimi, the son of a wealthy business tycoon.
files further suggest that in 2015, Sheikh Saoud gave Dr Ruja four USB memory sticks containing 230,000 bitcoin - worth €48.5m at the time. 
In return, Dr Ruja handed over three cheques to Sheikh Saoud from Mashreq Bank, totalling around 210m Emirati dirhams, roughly €50m.
Prior to the alleged deal, Dubai's Mashreq Bank had begun closing Dr Ruja's accounts amid money-laundering concerns, so the cheques were unable to be cashed. 
In 2020, the Dubai authorities unfroze Dr Ruja's funds, despite the fact that more than a year earlier the US Department of Justice had published an indictment for her, labelling OneCoin a ""fraudulent cryptocurrency"". 
Months before the decision, Dr Ruja's former fund manager Mark Scott was also found guilty in New York of laundering $400m in OneCoin proceeds. 
Asked by the BBC about the decision, Dubai's Public Prosecutor did not respond.
According to Dubai Court of Appeal records, on 28 April 2022, Sheikh Saoud was seeking to have Dr Ruja's funds handed to him - suggesting a deal of some kind did originally take place between the pair. Dr Ruja herself is named as a respondent, despite not being seen in public for nearly five years. 
Little is known about Sheikh Saoud, but sources tell us the stocky body-building enthusiast is rarely seen in public.
He features in a 2017 YouTube video for an organisation called the Intergovernmental Collaborative Action Fund for Excellence (ICAFE) which claims to support education initiatives, but after the Dubai files were released, references to Sheikh Al Qassimi as ICAFE's ""Secretary-General"" disappeared from its website. 
A recently launched cryptocurrency also lists the sheikh as its chairman. The Dubai files appear to show a once close relationship between the Al Qassimi family and Dr Ruja.
On 3 September 2015, Dubai's Mashreq Bank wrote to Dr Ruja to explain that it would be closing her personal accounts.
Eleven days later, an email admitted to a US court shows Dr Ruja writing to a OneCoin colleague about moving €50m out of Mashreq Bank. She mentions a meeting the following week with ""one of the Sheiks [sic] in Dubai"" where she would ""try to get something done for us"".
It is not known who Dr Ruja intended to meet or even if a meeting took place, but the files hint at one possible explanation. 
A photo from the files seemingly dated 8 October 2015 but taken at an unknown place, pictures Dr Ruja standing next to Sheikh Faisal, the father of Sheikh Saoud. 
Al Qassimi family rules Sharjah, which borders Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah (RAK), the northernmost emirate. Sheikh Faisal did not respond to us about his family's relationship with Dr Ruja.
files also include a diplomatic ID, issued to Ruja as a ""special adviser"" to ICAFE - the organisation with which Sheikh Saoud once held a senior role.
rganisation appears to be connected to the United Nations, but a spokesman for the UN Secretary-General could not find any records of it being affiliated through normal routes. 
Co-founder Shariar Rahimi said ICAFE was ""registered"" with the UN, but failed to provide evidence of this. On Dr Ruja, he said any ICAFE documents provided to her came from Sheikh Saoud.
Some time after Dr Ruja's alleged Bitcoin deal, their relationship appears to have soured - one letter among the leaked files shows Sheikh Saoud dismissing Dr Ruja from a role as an ICAFE ambassador, before later becoming involved in a legal dispute over her assets.
ween the pair concluded in Dubai's Court of Appeal on 28 June.
Asked about the alleged Bitcoin deal, his relationship with Dr Ruja, and his role at ICAFE, Sheikh Saoud's lawyer did not directly respond, but wrote: ""All the information you have is baseless"".
ged Bitcoin transaction is said to have taken place using what's called cold-storage wallets, making it very difficult to ascertain if it actually happened. 
Bitcoin transactions can often be traced because all transfers of the virtual currency between wallets are recorded on a publicly viewable database. However, the court documents do not include any details about which - or how many - wallets these bitcoins were stored on.    
If she does still have them, Dr Ruja might find it difficult to move such a large amount of bitcoin. 
Crypto-author David Birch thinks Bitcoin's reputation as an ""anonymous"" currency is inaccurate because law enforcement agencies are increasingly using clever algorithms to track coins as they flow through the system.
""Getting rid of a few billion dollars' worth is much harder than you think,"" he said.
If Dr Ruja still has the 230,000 bitcoins, she would be one of the currency's largest holders. In November 2021, her stake would have peaked at nearly $15bn, but at the time of writing it has dropped to around $5bn, still more than enough to help her stay hidden.

technology	Twitter UK staff get deadline over cuts consultation	"witter staff in the UK who face losing their jobs have been given three days to nominate someone to represent them in a formal consultation about their employment.
Under UK employment law a consultation has to be carried out before redundancies can be made.
An email seen by the BBC from Twitter's European HR department says they have until 0900 Tuesday to decide who to put forward, and was sent on Friday night.
Staff can nominate themselves.
If there are more than 10 nominations, an election will be held, the email said, although there were no details offered as to how this would be organised.
It comes after Elon Musk, the company's new owner, said he had ""no choice"" but to cut 50% of Twitter's staff worldwide.
Mr Musk said the firm he bought for $44bn at the end of October is currently losing around $4m per day.
first Twitter layoffs were announced one day after Mr Musk bought the company.
CEO Parag Agrawal was among the workers who received their notice, with around half of Twitter's 7,500 staff expected to be cut. 
Following the announcement, the workers union Prospect said it now has ""dozens"" of Twitter UK staff members on its books.
If more than 100 people in the UK are affected by a firm's job cuts then there must be a 45-day consultation before any redundancies can be made, it added.
A senior official told the BBC three days was a very short time frame for people to organise themselves or communicate with each other, especially given that most still have frozen access to company-wide work platforms such as the messaging service Slack and their Twitter email accounts.
Seven days was considered a ""reasonable"" period of time for this to take place, she said, although there is no official rule. 
Mr Musk first announced he wanted to buy Twitter for $44bn in April - but it took a long and tumultuous six months for a deal to be struck. 
In July, the tech billionaire said he had pulled out of the sale because he had not been given enough information on how many real, active Twitter users there were.
witter responded by taking Mr Musk to court so that he would honour the sale.
urt case was then stalled when Mr Musk announced that he had bought the platform for $44bn at the end of October.
re is uncertainty over Mr Musk's plans for the platform's future. Online safety groups and campaigners have expressed concerns about his plans to relax content moderation and reverse permanent Twitter bans given to controversial figures, including former US president Donald Trump.
He also sparked criticism for suggesting that verified Twitter users pay $8 (£7) a month for their blue ticks."	/news/technology-63527336
business	Cost of living: Lessons from history about how we spend	"In 1967, in a field near the village of Cridling Stubbs in North Yorkshire, a pot containing more than 3,300 Roman coins was unearthed.
rd of copper coins from the 300s AD were still in the jar, buried upright, with a makeshift lid on top.
""We do not know for certain why they were buried there, and why nobody ever came back to find them,"" says Kat Baxter, Leeds Museums and Galleries' curator of archaeology and numismatics.
""That is the beauty of them - we do not know the answers. It is very mysterious.""
We may not have the answers, but there are theories. The coins not only help us think about what wealthy people were doing with their cash nearly 2,000 years ago but may also frame some of the debate about the cost of living and cash today.
Cridling Stubbs hoard may have been buried for religious reasons, as some kind of offering to the gods. 
Another possibility, is that it was hidden somewhere thought to be safe in a time before banks and building societies, particularly if the owners felt their money might be taken during a time of conflict.
""These were the security worries of the time. We have the same worries today but they just take a different form,"" Ms Baxter says.
Fraudsters steal £4m a day from people in the UK, so protection against such cons is high on the agenda for the finance industry and its customers.
Cridling Stubbs hoard is among more than 400 objects on display at the Money Talks exhibition, which runs at Leeds City Museum until 26 June.
As well as money security, the exhibits explore subjects including how money has been used in toys and play, the evolution of banking, and different examples of currency used around the world.
""Everyone has a relationship with money in some way,"" Ms Baxter says.
Our relationship with money is being tested at present, not only through the rising cost of living, but also in the changing way we pay for things.
Since 2015, according to the consumer group Which?, some 4,685 bank branches have shut their doors.
A further 226 are already scheduled to close by the end of the year, it says, while the rate of closures in rural areas has outstripped those in urban areas.
People are increasingly using their smartphones and computers to manage their finances. Cards are now a much more common method of transaction than notes and coins.
However, Which? has warned that a move to a cashless society would leave millions of people ""cut adrift"". The government declared in the most recent Queen's Speech that it would legislate to ensure people had access to cash withdrawal and deposit facilities within a reasonable distance of home.
xhibition in Leeds confirms there are plenty of examples through history of changing ways of paying for things.
ke, for example, the kind of items used as currency. In one display case sits a finely polished and ground axe head. It was probably never used to chop anything, but would have been used in some kind of transaction - a bit like bartering.
Ms Baxter points out that there would be a wider cultural impact if notes and coins were to disappear entirely.
One part of the exhibition examines how cash is used as a lucky charm in many ways - from popping it into the shoe of a new bride, to embedding it into necklaces.
""Going cashless does not just mean losing physical coins, it means losing a number of traditions too,"" she says.
Less of a charm and more of a convenience is the way payment is often embedded into the things we wear and carry nowadays.
Using a smartphone or a watch, many of us will routinely tap to pay for items, or a bus or train fare, 
Perhaps we are happy to lose some of the traditions and physicality of cash?
A recent survey by the card issuing platform, Marqeta, found that 77% of respondents aged 18 to 24 were confident enough in contactless payments to leave their wallet at home and go out with just their phone.
""While the pandemic was the catalyst for the shift to contactless and mobile wallets, it is the convenience, security, and speed of these payment options that have made them sticky,"" says Anna Porra, Marqeta's European strategy director.
Although she says these so-called intelligent mobile wallets are still in their infancy.
Diners are already paying at a restaurant by scanning a QR code on their phone at the table and settling the bill, without ever having to call over a waiter. Soon, she says, we will be standing at a bus stop and scanning QR codes for something we might be able to buy nearby.
most significant developments will come, she suggests, when our devices not only act as a payment mechanism but also use artificial intelligence to prompt us with ways to manage our finances.
merging of payments and financial services could even give information to businesses of our worthiness to buy something on credit, and guide consumers on the way to pay and whether it is affordable.
So-called super apps in the US and China already branch out into identifying what financial products might be available to consumers, as well as providing other services such as food, hotels and taxi options.
Ms Porra says widespread adoption of intelligent wallets will only come if providers also offer widespread education, to ensure users can be confident and have control over what is being suggested.
So, in the end it comes back to trust and security - not so different to the thought processes of someone burying a pot of coins in North Yorkshire nearly 2,000 years ago."	/news/business-61336233

Maiden did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.
Last week, the company said it was ""shocked to hear media reports regarding the deaths and deeply saddened by this incident"".

entertainment	Royal Opera House bans audience member for heckling child actor	"Royal Opera House has banned an audience member for life for booing and heckling a 12-year-old actor during a production of Handel's opera Alcina.
Malakai M Bayoh was met with cries of ""Rubbish!"" while singing his lines, on Tuesday, opening night, in London.
Onlookers shushed the heckler, who left soon after, and loudly applauded Bayoh.
ROH said it was ""appalled"" at the outburst and praised the classically trained youngster for his well reviewed portrayal of Oberto. 
In a statement shared with BBC News, a spokesman said: ""Malakai is astonishingly talented, bringing great acting and beautiful singing to the role - a huge accomplishment for such a young singer.
""Unfortunately, the opening night of Alcina featured an audience member who disrupted the show and Malakai's excellent performance.
""We are appalled that a member of the audience behaved in this way and our support is with Malakai and the cast and creative team of Alcina.
""Steps have been taken to ensure the audience member in question does not return to the Royal Opera House.""
Financial Times associate arts editor Josh Spero broke the news, tweeting the ""nastiest thing happened"" at the production.
""A 12-year-old boy was sweetly singing his lines when a man in the audience yelled, 'Rubbish!' and booed him,"" he wrote. 
""Who would do that to a child?
""Once the boy was done, the audience responded with wild applause and cheering.""
Rebecca Franks, of the Times, reported ""vile behaviour from one audience member at Alcina at the Royal Opera House"".
""He booed and heckled the young boy singing (in a lovely way) Oberto,"" she posted.
""Thankfully, the rest of the audience drowned the heckler out with extra-loud, heartfelt applause. But, seriously, who boos a child?""
Others soon shared this disdain online, with one tweeting: ""Paying for a ticket doesn't give people the right to act however they want.""
Bayoh, who trained at the Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School, features alongside Lisette Oropesa, Emily D'Angelo, Mary Bevan, Varduhi Abrahamyan and Rupert Charlesworth in Richard Jones's production of Handel's fantastical 1735 opera seria.
He was praised by critics for his excellent performance under difficult circumstances.
In a four-star review for the Guardian, Martin Kettle wrote: ""Jones's dramatically poignant choice of a child alto (here a reedy Malakhai Bayoh) to sing the lost boy Oberto caused barracking from one single person that was quickly - and rightly - drowned in cheers from everyone else.""
graph's Nicholas Kenyon also gave four stars, referring to a ""shameful heckle"" while noting Bayoh ""received a huge ovation"".
""The evil spirit of Handel's enchantress Alcina evidently infected one audience member at Tuesday's premiere of this new production,"" he wrote. 
""The young Malakai M Bayoh, making his debut in the role of the boy Oberto, was shamefully heckled in the middle of an aria that he was singing skilfully and exuberantly."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63566862
sports	The Glasgow karate club where women fight men	"Women should be allowed to fight men in karate competitions, according to instructor Ben Fail.
He says that although men and women spar together, it is unusual to see them take each other on in competition.
""Karate is about control and technique so, for me, gender doesn't even come in to it,"" Ben says.
Five years ago, he held a mixed-gender competition for under 16s at his Glasgow club, which invited other clubs to join in.  
Ben says the idea was not fully welcomed by other coaches because they were unsure of breaking the tradition of gender segregation within competitions - even though opposite genders fight each other in training classes in other clubs too.
He says he has not run an open competition since 2014 because of the uncertainties from other coaches.
However, Ben instructs his training classes with mixed-gender partners and continues to hold in-house competitions, which are always mixed. 
He says another reason for not holding mixed-gender open competitions is karate's upcoming involvement in the Olympics for the first time.
""There's enough going on in the sport at the moment without adding any further complications or disagreements from other coaches or anyone from the world governing body,"" he says.
Scottish Karate Governing Body (SKGB) has insisted that members have had the ability to hold mixed-gender championships within their own clubs for many years. 
It says genders are segregated in national championships in order for members to qualify for tournaments at a higher level.
Ben, who runs the Glasgow Karate Academy in Kirkintilloch, says he will continue to raise the issue with fellow coaches at competitions.
Karate is a Japanese martial art based on unarmed (empty-handed) self defence. Students develop speed, strength and control through the study of individual techniques and combinations as well as partner work under controlled conditions and under the supervision of a qualified sensei (instructor).
Paul Monigatti, a student at Ben's club, supports the idea of mixed competitions.
""Although it's a contact sport, it's a semi-contact sport,"" he says. 
""We're not trying to hit each other hard, it's about skill and ability. So having male and female competitors fighting each other - it's more about skill - and so it should even it up in that sense.""
Fabiana Turelli Thume is also a student at Ben's club. Born in Brazil, she began her karate journey fighting boys because she was the only female in her club at the time. 
She is now studying her PhD in Glasgow in ""the construction of the female identity in karate as an Olympic sport"". 
""Women are conquering more space,"" she says. ""When I started, at age 11, I was the only female in my dojo. It was not until I was 16 that one other girl started.""
Fabiana says she feels very comfortable doing karate and has no problem doing it with a man or with a woman. 
""It's absolutely the same,"" she says. ""I think we think too much. If you put everybody together there could be less discrimination.""
Ben, who has studied karate for about 25 years, also encourages children to take part in mixed-gender fights [kumite] at his club.
metimes prompted concern from parents but he insisted they have been reassured after seeing that participants were evenly matched and that safety was paramount.
Barry Carruthers, the father of nine-year-old Charles, who is a student of Ben's, says: ""Really, in principle there's no reason why competitions should be about getting hurt or hurting anyway. It's about technique so it shouldn't matter about gender.""
Ben remains unsure if the traditional attitudes of his fellow instructors will change on the matter and is passionate about moving forward with mixed-gender categories in his own in-house competitions. 
""It just baffles me that it's never been done before,"" he says. 
""To my knowledge, I'm the first one to have done it. I think the attitudes of some instructors, examiners, referees and just the organisation as a whole, needs to change. I'll always do it in my classes and in the competitions I run but I don't know if it'll ever catch on.""
Scottish Karate Governing Body (SKGB) said it promotes equality, diversity and inclusion throughout its membership.
""Numerous associations within the SKGB have had mixed gender tournaments for over 20 years,"" a statement said.
""At national level we have separate male and female championships to fall in line with qualifying for the following European and World bodies tournaments."""	/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-50671825

business	Philippines lottery: Questions raised as hundreds win jackpot	"A lottery in the Philippines that saw 433 people hit the jackpot has drawn surprise and triggered scrutiny.
It was the highest number of people to have ever won the Grand Lotto's top prize, according to local media.
winning combination for last weekend's 236m peso ($4m; £3.5m) jackpot was a series of numbers which were all multiples of nine.
Philippines senate minority leader Koko Pimentel has called for an inquiry into the ""suspicious"" results.
Participants in the Grand Lotto select six numbers from one to 55. To win the jackpot, all six of a player's numbers have to match those drawn by the lottery's operator.
""These lotto games are authorised by the Republic of the Philippines. Therefore, we need to maintain and protect the integrity of these gambling games,"" Mr Pimentel said as he called for an investigation into the lottery's unusual outcome.
On Sunday, Melquiades Robles, general manager of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), sought to reassure the public and said the drawing of winning numbers cannot be rigged.
PCSO also highlighted that people in the Philippines tended to bet on number sequences.
""Many have held on to their numbers. It's not only good to be loyal to your wives and husbands, it's also good to be loyal to your numbers,"" Mr Robles told a news conference.
PCSO also shared photographs and videos of people collecting their prize money at its office in Mandaluyong city, close to the capital Manila.
""I've been betting on pattern nine, pattern eight, pattern seven and pattern six for many years and I'm thankful I just won,"" one winner said.
rence Tao, a maths professor from University of California, Los Angeles told the BBC that a pattern like this being a winning series of numbers is rare ""for any single lottery"".
""But there are hundreds of lotteries every day around the world, and statistically it would not be surprising that every few decades, one of these lotteries would exhibit an unusual pattern,"" he said.
""It's similar to how in any given hand of poker it would be unlikely to draw a straight flush, but if one looks at hundreds of thousands of hands at once then it actually becomes quite likely that a straight flush would be drawn,"" he added.
It's not the first time a lottery has seen an unusual pattern or sequence of numbers drawn.
re were accusations of fraud after 20 people shared the jackpot in South Africa's national lottery in December 2020, when the numbers five, six, seven, eight, nine and 10 were drawn.
rganisers said the winners collected 5.7m rand ($370,000; £278,000) each.
Meanwhile, a Spanish TV reporter resigned live on air after she thought she'd hit the jackpot in the country's €4m ($3.9m; £3.4m) Christmas lottery.
Natalia Escudero started screaming on camera and told colleagues at public broadcaster RTVE she was ""not coming to work tomorrow"" - before later learning she had won just €5,000 ($4,349; £3,784).
And spare a thought for those whose lucky numbers came up in a lotto draw in the UK in March 2016.
More than 4,000 correctly picked five out of the six numbers - all multiples of seven - and ended up collecting just £15 each for their win.

business	Santander UK fined £108m over money laundering failings	"Santander has been fined £107.7m over ""serious and persistent gaps"" in its anti-money laundering controls which opened the door to ""financial crime"".
financial watchdog said the bank ""failed to properly oversee and manage"" systems aimed at verifying information provided by business customers.
Santander also failed to properly monitor the money customers had going through their accounts.
k said it was ""very sorry"" for the failings and had taken action. 
Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said: ""Santander's poor management of their anti-money laundering systems and their inadequate attempts to address the problems created a prolonged and severe risk of money laundering and financial crime.
failings affected the oversight of accounts held by more than 560,000 business customers between 31 December 2012 and 18 October 2017, and led to more than £298m passing through the bank before it closed accounts.
FCA said that in one case, a new customer opened an account as a small translations business with expected monthly deposits of £5,000. Within six months it was receiving millions in deposits, and swiftly transferring the money to separate accounts.
Although the account was recommended for closure by the bank's own anti-money laundering team in March 2014, the FCA said that poor processes by Santander meant that it was not acted upon until September 2015. 
As a result, the customer continued to receive and transfer millions of pounds through its account.
City watchdog identified several other business banking accounts which Santander failed to manage correctly, leaving the bank open to ""serious money laundering risk"". 
Santander chief executive Mike Regnier said: ""We are very sorry for the historical anti-money laundering related controls issues in our Business Banking division between 2012-17 highlighted in the FCA's findings.""
He said the bank took action to address the issues once they were identified, but accepted that its anti-money laundering controls at the time should have been stronger.
""We have since made significant changes to address this by overhauling our financial crime technology, systems and processes, he said, adding that more than 4,400 Santander staff are now focused on preventing financial crime.
Regulators have been busy cracking down on banks for money-laundering failures. 
ggest UK fine was for NatWest, which was penalised £265m in December 2021 after it admitted three offences of failing to comply with money laundering regulations between 2012 and 2016. It failed to prevent money-laundering of nearly £400m by a Bradford gold trading business, which in one instance deposited £700,000 in cash into a branch in black bin bags. 
HSBC was also fined in December 2021, paying £64m after the FCA found ""unacceptable failings"" in its anti-money laundering systems between 2010 to 2018. The bank had previously been fined £1.4bn for failing to prevent laundering by Mexican drug cartels after an investigation by the US Department of Justice. 
In June this year, Credit Suisse was fined for involvement in money laundering related to a Bulgarian drugs ring. It was fined around £1.7m and ordered to pay £15m to the Swiss government.

Last month, the US linked North Korea-backed hackers to a massive cryptocurrency heist worth $615m (£498.4m) from players of the popular online game Axie Infinity.
Also in April, a former US researcher at a cryptocurrency group was sentenced to more than five years in prison for conspiring to help North Korea evade US sanctions.
Virgil Griffith formerly worked for the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organisation focused on the technology behind the cryptocurrency ether.
He had pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the US International Emergency Economic Powers Act by travelling to North Korea's capital Pyongyang to give a presentation on blockchain technology.

health	Two years after Covid food still tastes rotten	"usands of people who had Covid-19 at the start of the pandemic are still finding that certain foods, toiletries and even their loved ones smell repulsive. All the food and socialising that Christmas brings can make this time of year particularly isolating and tough for those with the condition, known as parosmia. 
will be Milly's second year wearing a nose peg in order to stomach a Christmas dinner around the table with her family. 
""Cheese, meat, onions and chocolate all taste and smell like death, like something rotten and horrible,"" says the 16-year-old, from Bolton. 
She developed parosmia in February 2021, three months after catching coronavirus and losing her sense of smell. 
Parosmia is essentially a distorted sense of smell. It is thought to be caused by specialised nerve cells in the nose failing to detect and translate odours in a way the brain can properly make sense of.
For Milly, it has impacted not only her diet but her social life and mental health too. 
""I don't go out with my friends as much because I don't eat for fun any more, I eat because I have to,"" she says. 
Milly's twin sister caught coronavirus around the same time but didn't get any symptoms, and Milly doesn't know anyone else with parosmia. 
She is persistently asked by some people when her sense of smell will go back to normal, which she finds insensitive and upsetting because she doesn't believe it ever will. 
She might feel it, but Milly is far from alone. 
It is estimated that about 65% of people who get coronavirus will temporarily lose their sense of smell, known as anosmia, and that at least 10% of those go on to develop parosmia - or a rarer condition, phantosmia, when you smell something that isn't there. 
Some clinical studies even suggest parosmia affects more like 40%-50% of people with covid-related anosmia. 
reason Covid causes parosmia has still to be pinned down, but it is thought the inflammation caused by viral infection may damage the receptors and nerves in our noses - and that some people may end up with a distorted sense of smell.
Coffee, meat, onion, garlic, eggs, and mint toothpaste are common parosmia triggers. But there are many more that have left scientists scratching their heads. Why do some people report that tap water now smells like raw sewage? Or that make-up smells like burnt hair?  
Source: AbScent
And why does parosmia only tend to kick-in about three months after the initial coronavirus infection? 
re is no known cure for parosmia and a person's odds of recovery are still unclear because meaningful research has only begun to take place since the coronavirus pandemic made numbers with the condition explode.
However, there are reasons to be hopeful, says Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon, Dr Simon Gane. 
""The good news is that the really disgusting parosmia does improve over time and things become more tolerable,"" says Mr Gane, a trustee of smell-loss charity AbScent. 
""There are also lots of people who completely recover.""
Mr Gane has worked with AbScent founder Chris Kelly, and Reading University flavour scientist Dr Jane Parker, to break down what the triggers of parosmia are on a molecular level - and which of the smell receptors in our noses could be picking up on those ""parosmic smells"". 
""Identifying those receptors is progress in the fight to cure parosmia because it means scientists can look at how they work - or don't - and whether they can be helped to work better,"" he says. 
udy were sourced from AbScent. The charity started a private Facebook group for people with parosmia in June 2020 and it now has more than 22,000 members. 
Its founder, Chris Kelly, has experienced parosmia herself and knows how hard this time of year will be for those still suffering with it. Any Christmas worries will be about a lot more than simply which foods are off the menu.  
""They often feel they are living at arms length from the joy and closeness of the holiday season,"" she says - adding that smell disorders like parosmia are associated with anxiety and depression. 
Some of AbScent's members say the anxiety they feel will escalate around situations where food is a big part, because they will be on high-alert for parosmia triggers.   
""It's exhausting to live with,"" says Kelly. ""Either in reality or expectant fear, it is like having a fire alarm go off every five minutes of your waking day.""
It helps a lot to have understanding friends and family, says Jen Watts, a mum-of-one from Farnborough in Hampshire. This will be the 39 year old's third Christmas with parosmia and things have gradually become easier. 
""Socialising can be hard but luckily my friends and family have been amazing and made adjustments for me,"" she says.  
""If they're seeing me they make sure they don't use their coconut-flavoured shampoo and they make special dishes for me when serving food.""
On Christmas day she will continue to miss her dad's bread sauce and an evening Baileys or cheese board, but he is going to prepare ""Jen-friendly"" alternatives.   
mall endeavour, with a list of trigger foods which includes all dairy, processed and cured meats, celery, coriander, nutmeg, overripe fruit and vegetables, most beans and coconut.  
But a normal Christmas dinner ""would taste like chemically mould"" - so she appreciates the effort. 
re have been some small silver linings with parosmia. ""Raspberries now taste delicious and floral and lemons have intensified in flavour,"" she says. The ingredients to a vegan lemon cake are always in the cupboard at home, should she need a zingy hit of flavour. 
Watts is determined not to let her parosmia overshadow Christmas. 
""At first I struggled with my mental health a fair bit,"" she says. 
""Now, I try to think of my parosmia as an allergy and I have learned to live with it."""	/news/uk-63972873
politics	Scotland's culture sector is in funding crisis, MSPs warn	"Scotland's culture sector is in crisis and needs an ""innovative approach"" to funding, MSPs have warned.
Holyrood's culture committee is calling on the Scottish government to consider the matter with ""increased urgency"".
Arts bosses at Creative Scotland said recovery from the Covid pandemic had been ""fragile and gradual"", as they faced increased costs and budget cuts.
group's core budget fell by about £13m from 2010 to 2022, the Scottish Parliament Information Centre found.
Culture Secretary Angus Robertson also told the committee that spending on culture and major events next year would be down 2.3%.
MSPs heard ""significant concerns"" from other organisations about the impact of the cost of living crisis. 
Historic Environment Scotland could see its energy costs quadruple to £4m, MSPs were told.
And National Galleries of Scotland said that visitor numbers and related income were still below pre-Covid levels, with this ""likely to be the case until at least 2025"".
In a new report, the committee warned: ""The sector now faces a 'perfect storm' as it struggles to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, compounded by the cost of living crisis, and following on from longer-term budget pressures.""
report added: ""Our view is that this means there is an increased urgency for the Scottish government to accelerate consideration and implementation of an innovative approach to the funding of the culture sector.""
Committee convener Clare Adamson said: ""Scotland's cultural sector plays a vital role in Scottish life. But we heard blunt warnings from those within the sector that stark choices lie ahead.
""Without truly innovative approaches to funding, there is a real danger that Scotland's skilled cultural workforce will be lost along with some of our best-loved cultural icons."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63450344

politics	Treasury refuses to publish UK economic forecast	"reasury is refusing to publish a forecast of the UK's economic outlook alongside this Friday's mini-Budget. 
Independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has already provided a draft to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, the BBC understands.
reasury Select Committee says a forecast is ""vital"" given recent government moves to curb living costs.
Action to cap annual energy bills could cost about £150bn, and tax cuts are expected on Friday.
mini-Budget is expected to see the government reverse a rise in National Insurance and scrap a planned increase in corporation tax, which reports say could cost £30bn.
raft forecast the OBR has provided does not include the impact of the energy bill help. It has offered to provide a forecast including this impact, but that has been rejected.
fact the offer has not been taken up is raising some concerns about whether the government's tax and spending policy is ""flying blind"", given predictions that the UK is facing a lengthy recession. 
MPs on the Treasury Select Committee wrote to the chancellor on Tuesday seeking assurance that an OBR forecast would be published.
""These forecasts are a vital indicator of the health of the nation's finances, and provide reassurance and confidence to international markets and investors,"" said the committee's chairman, Mel Stride.
""There has been a deterioration in our economic outlook since the last OBR forecast in March. There have been significant fiscal interventions since then and we are told there will be further significant interventions including major permanent tax cuts to be announced on Friday.
""Under these circumstances, it is vital that an independent OBR forecast is provided.""
OBR is obliged to produce economic forecasts twice a year, usually accompanying the Autumn Budget and Spring Statement. 
On Friday, there will be no independent assessment about whether permanent tax cuts and some one-off spending increases are consistent with the government's Budget rules. 
k of OBR forecast also means it will not cast judgement on the impact of the new tax measures on growth - a key target for the government which wants to increase the trend rate of growth to 2.5%.
A spokesperson for the Treasury said: ""Given the exceptional circumstances our country faces, we have moved at immense speed to provide significant energy bill support for households and businesses, and are acting swiftly to set out further plans to kickstart economic growth later this week.
""We remain committed to maintaining the usual two forecasts in this fiscal year, as is required.""
In its latest long-term forecast in July, the OBR said trend growth had fallen from 2.2% to 1.4%, partly because of a declining size of the workforce.
In the City, where in recent weeks the value of the pound sterling has fallen and the cost of borrowing for the UK government has risen, there is some expectation that the Treasury will imminently have to formally increase its ""remit"" for borrowing. 
Financing Remit is given to the Debt Management Office based on a forecast for borrowing. Extra sales of government loans, known as gilts, also need to be co-ordinated with the Bank of England, which is planning to sell off some of the gilts it owns, as it starts to reverse its long-running programme of stimulus.
Government insiders say that the main motivation behind Friday's announcements is to enact the PM's leadership campaign promises as quickly as possible, and that a full forecast will accompany an upcoming Budget statement.

health	Winter set to be worst ever for A&E waits, health leaders warn	"NHS is facing the worst winter for A&E waits on record, as hospitals are being ""pressurised like never before"", health leaders have warned.
Royal College of Emergency Medicine says it believes this will have been the worst December for hospital bed occupancy and emergency care delays.
warning comes as hospitals face soaring demand driven by winter infections like flu, strep A and Covid.
government says it is ""working tirelessly"" to ensure patient care.
A number of NHS trusts have declared critical incidents in recent days, signalling they are unable to function as normal due to extraordinary pressure.
Dr Adrian Boyle, the president of the RCEM, told the BBC that hospitals were ""too full"" and the situation was ""much worse than in previous years"".
Ambulances waiting outside hospitals was the ""most obvious marker"" of this, Dr Boyle told Radio 4's Today programme.
In November, around 37,837 people waited more than 12 hours in A&E for a decision to be admitted to a hospital department, according to data from NHS England.
was more than triple the equivalent figure for November 2021, when an estimated 10,646 waited longer than 12 hours.
In separate remarks to the PA news agency, Dr Boyle said he ""would not be at all surprised"" if December proved to be the worst month on record for hospital occupancy rates. 
Over 90% of senior doctors reported there had been people waiting in their emergency department for more than 24 hours last week, he added. 
Dr Boyle remarked: ""The gallows joke about this is now that 24 hours in A&E is not a documentary, it's a way of life."" 
He said the health service had been stretched further by a ""staff retention crisis"", as well as recent nurse and ambulance worker strikes and a ""demand shock"" caused by winter infections.
Fears of a ""twindemic"" of flu and Covid infections were ""sadly being realised"", added MP Steve Brine, chair of the Commons health and social care select committee.
was ""very heavily weighted"" towards flu infections, Mr Brine said in his own interview with the BBC.  
Flu case numbers in Wales have put the country's hospitals in an ""unprecedented situation"", says its top doctor - and those with symptoms have been asked to stay away from hospitals.
At the same time, the 111 telephone helpline has come under ""significant pressure"", Dr Sir Frank Atherton said. People have instead been urged to consult the 111 website.
Meanwhile in England, the latest figures show there were more than 3,700 patients a day in hospital with flu last week - up from 520 a day the month before, and just 34 a day this time last year.
Among the NHS trusts to have declared ""critical incidents"" in recent days are:
Other trusts previously declared critical incidents but have since removed the status as conditions improved - including Surrey and Sussex Healthcare, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals, East of England Ambulance, and University Hospitals of Derby and Burton. 
On top of this, several ambulance services have declared critical incidents over the past two weeks - with North East Ambulance Service and East of England Ambulance Service doing so twice. 
No critical incidents have been declared in Scotland, but A&E doctors have urged NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to declare one over ""grave concerns"" over patient safety, the BBC understands.
In his own comments to the PA news agency, Dr Nick Scriven, the former president of the Society for Acute Medicine, warned that UK's urgent care system was being ""pressurised like never before"".
He urged people to ""consider carefully"" whether or not their problem required emergency care before attending a hospital.
Dr Scriven said the NHS should consider a ""short-term moratorium"" on the pressure to ease backlogs in elective procedures - with services working together ""for the common good"".
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social care said: ""We recognise the pressures the NHS is facing following the impact of the pandemic and are working tirelessly to ensure people get the care they need, backed by up to £14.1bn additional funding for health and social care over the next two years. 
""This winter, the government has provided an extra £500m to speed up hospital discharge and free up beds - and the NHS is creating the equivalent of at least 7,000 more beds to help reduce A&E waits and get ambulances back on the road.
""We're supporting and growing the health and social care workforce through training and recruitment campaigns at home and abroad, and there are record numbers of staff working for the NHS, including 9,300 more nurses and almost 4,000 more doctors compared to September 2021."""	/news/health-64131551

technology	Hashtags, a viral song and memes empower Iran's protesters	"Anti-government protests have swept across Iran over the past six weeks, with women and schoolgirls at the forefront - burning their headscarves or swinging them in the air while shouting ""Woman, Life, Freedom"". 
monstrations were sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who was detained by the morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab (headscarf) ""inappropriately"".
While thousands of people have been taking to the streets to show their anger at the clerical establishment, many more both inside and outside Iran have been amplifying their calls on social media and spreading awareness.
Getting a hashtag to trend on Twitter has been one of the main ways for Iranians to get their voices heard around the world. 
g #mahsaamini was tweeted and retweeted more than 250 million times in Persian and more than 50 million times in English in the first month after her death.
""People [in Iran] are constantly told that opposition to the system doesn't exist or if it does it is little and will be crushed,"" says Iranian women's rights activist Negin Shiraghaei.
""Hashtags play an important role for people to find each other and recognise their power."" 
In the age of leaderless movements, Ms Shiraghaei says, hashtags could play the role of leaders.
""What do people want from hashtags? Hope, guidance and information,"" she explains. ""That is what the hashtag has done for protesters so far.""
But hashtags and Twitter storms are just some of the ways Iranians hear from each other and make the world take notice.
reaction of Iranian authorities towards the protests has often been violent.
Norway-based Iran Human Rights has reported that at least 253 protesters have been killed by security forces, 34 of them children. 
But even in dark times like this Iranians have tried to use humour to keep their spirits up. 
After an evening news bulletin on state run TV was hacked by protesters and replaced with an image of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in flames, people made memes of the TV presenter's stone-faced reaction. 
ked fun at the presenter by inserting his face into a viral clip of Snoop Dog and Kevin Hart laughing on their talk show.
mandatory hijab laws and what the protesters see as the constant meddling of Islamic laws in their everyday lives have been the targets of much of the criticism on social media.
At the start of the unrest, many Iranians expressed their reasons for protesting in posts on Twitter and Instagram that started with the Persian phrase ""Baraye..."", or ""For the sake of..."".
""For the sake of all the times we had to lower the volume of our music in the car when you guys [morality police] passed by, for all the cassettes we had to hide,"" tweeted Usaneh_dahr. 
Western pop music and Iranian pop music produced outside the country are banned in Iran, and for decades authorities would stop and search cars - and even raid homes - in search of what they called ""indecent music"". 
""For the sake of all the girls who have to bury the dream of ever going to a professional dance school, for myself,"" tweeted Ferferity. 
Dancing in public in Iran is banned, with the exception of some traditional dances performed by men. Women do not have the right to dance or sing in public under any circumstances, although underground women-only dance classes do exist. 
In 2017, the government even banned Zumba exercise classes in gender-segregated gyms, calling them ""un-Islamic"". 
""For my mother tongue,"" said another tweet by RMshii94.
was a reference to the 43-year-old ban on ethnic minorities teaching their own languages in schools in Iran. 
who defy the ban face imprisonment like Zara Mohammadi, a Kurdish language teacher currently serving a five-year sentence for teaching her mother tongue. 
An Iranian pop singer living in Iran, Shervin Hajipour, gathered a number of such tweets and wrote a song about them, entitled ""Baraye..."" 
Instagram page was viewed 40m times in the first 48 hours it was online. 
""Baraye…"" has since become an anthem of the protests and has been played at solidarity rallies all over the world.
Hajipour was arrested on 29 September and released on bail on 4 October. After his release, Hajipour posted an Instagram story saying he regretted that his song was being used by political groups outside the country for ""certain purposes"". 
It is not clear whether he was still in detention when he made the statement and whether he was under duress. 
Activists say Iranian state media routinely broadcast forced ""confessions"" as a means to suppress dissent.
In the past four decades artists inside Iran have found clever ways to bypass the censorship of the ministry of culture and Islamic guidance. 
Foroozan, a digital creator based in Los Angeles, has been posting art on her Instagram page to support the protests inside Iran.
One of her works shows the image of a young woman standing in front of the iconic Si-o-Se Pol, a 17th Century arched bridge in Isfahan, and cutting her ponytail. 
r is an act that has become one of the symbols of the protests in Iran, and women all over the world have been doing the same in solidarity with Iranian women. 
An artist inside Iran called Benyamin created a short video, entitled Unity for Freedom, that has gone viral on social media.
It shows the gloved hand of a member of the security forces wielding a truncheon and beating the other hands around him. However, his hand is eventually overcome by the other hands. The video ends with his hand joining theirs in making a victory sign.
Such online material has meant that the protesters' voices have not been silenced, even as the clampdown continues on and off the streets in Iran
""In a country where the people have no media, social media has become the medium of the people,"" says Negin Shiraghaei. ""It is a decentralised media that allows people to be heard and seen."""	/news/world-middle-east-63456599
technology	Taiwan's front-line battle against mobile phone fraud	"ms security boss Jeff Kuo says that fighting mobile phone fraud is a constant battle, and that Taiwan is on the front line.
""This is like a miniature of the world, here in Taiwan, where we see all kinds of fraud in advance,"" says Mr Kuo. ""We can use this knowledge to protect other countries, because we can see what is going to happen first.""
Mr Kuo is boss of Taiwanese firm Gogolook, which owns Whoscall, one of the most popular spam blocking apps on the island, and across East Asia in general. 
It says its artificial intelligence powered software constantly trawls more than 1.6 billion telephone numbers, both Taiwanese ones, and also ones from across Asia and other parts of the world, to block messages and calls from likely fraudsters.
Working with Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau's (CIB's) ""165 Anti-Fraud Program"", Whoscall blocked more 52.3 million scam messages, and 13.1 million scam calls, last year in Taiwan alone.
But why is Taiwan such a hotbed for telecoms fraud? Mr Kuo says the island's small population of 23.5 million makes it a prefect ""practice ground"" for organised criminals, both Taiwanese gangs and those from mainland China and elsewhere. They try out a new phone scam in Taiwan, and if it works there then they can expand it out across Asia and then globally.
""[For example], we provide Apple with a lot of evidence... until they realise there is a serious problem,"" says Mr Kuo. ""A problem that is not only going to spread out in Taiwan, but also in Asia Pacific, and if they don't take care of it, very soon it will be in Europe and the US.""
CIB telecoms fraud investigator Jean Hsiao Ya-yun tells the BBC that another reason why so many new scams originate on the island is the very fact that Taiwan is one of Asia's top manufacturers of high-tech technology. She says this level of technical expertise is shared by Taiwanese scammers.
Ms Hsiao adds that the coronavirus pandemic was a boom time for scammers as millions of people were stuck at home, and, therefore, more reliant upon their phones.
""And the Taiwan stock market was very high at the time, so many people earned a lot of money,"" she says, adding that this led to a big rise in investment scams.
""Scammers would [for example] give advice on app pages, or they would start a chat group saying that they can tell you when a stock is going to rise, and they can share this intel if you join their group."" 
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
mmers would then ask for money for the information. Other such investment scams would see people receiving phone message from friendly strangers offering loans at very low rates.
Such is the extent of the criminal networks behind the scamming that some Taiwanese gangs have opened up operations overseas. Ms Hsiao points to one case from 2020 when 92 Taiwanese people were arrested in Montenegro.
In other cases, Taiwanese people are lured overseas to countries such as Cambodia under the false promise of high wages. There they are forced to work against their will as telephone fraudsters, as the BBC reported in September.
Mr Kuo admits that there is a ""weapons race"" between anti-fraud firms like his, and the fraudsters. And while Whoscall and similar apps block millions of messages and phone calls, some still get through.
Anyone who has lived in Taiwan, regardless of age or nationality, is familiar with one method used by fraudsters - burst dialling. Answering an unknown number leads to you hearing a brief dialling sound, and then a pre-recorded message starts playing.
re made by auto-dial systems capable of making hundreds a minute. It's an effective way for the fraudsters to find the working numbers of people who are prepared to answer their phone despite not knowing who is ringing them.
wanese cyber security expert TonTon Huang says that once such a person has been found, scammers call back.
""If [they find] the number is used by someone, they will sell the active phone data, or tell you that you need to pay a loan, insurance payment, or remit money,"" he says. ""The most common one seems to be about instalment payments, like you shopped online and you need to pay in instalments or something.""
While scammers are often looking for older people who might not be familiar with technology or keep up with scam trends, the CIB's Ms Hsiao says they still dupe plenty of young adults as well.
Earlier this year, a 20-something Taiwanese YouTuber Edison Lin posted a video on the platform in which he emotionally revealed that he had been a victim of telephone fraud.
He had been conned out of $13,000 [£12,600] by two fraudsters working together.
Mr Lin said it happened after he was called by someone pretending to an employee of a restaurant he had visited a few months earlier. The man told him that he had accidently been overcharged by $380, and that he would be offered assistance to get the money back.
After Mr Lin had ended that call he was soon telephoned again, this time by the other fraudster pretending to from his bank.
""When the [fake] clerk from E.Sun Bank called, he knew the whole story, he told me how to get compensation from E.Sun,"" Mr Lin said in his video. ""His professionalism made me think he was really a bank clerk.
""Before long we were talking back and forth for half an hour... and I noticed one of them was transferring [my] money... I still haven't paid off the debt.""
Prof Sandra Wachter, a senior research fellow in AI at Oxford University, is a global expert on the use of AI software systems.
She says AI can be an effective tool in defending against telecoms and other tech-based fraud, but that the general public also needs to be better educated about the risks.
""Technology is being used to scale-up fraud attempts… it allows scammers to cast a wider net and work more efficiently,"" she says. ""At the same time, some people might be more gullible and vulnerable to deceit because texting or calls seem legitimate, especially if executed in convincing and sophisticated ways. 
""Since fraud is scaling up, the strategy to combat these attempts must too scale up and so it makes sense to deploy AI software for this purpose. 
""The question is how effective these attempts are, and if we will be able to fully stop this behaviour? And the answer is, probably not, but we can curb it temporarily. Digital literacy and education can help people not to fall into the trap. AI can help to detect these scams and intervene.""
Back at spam-blocking app Whoscall, Jeff Kuo agrees, saying fighting fraudsters ""may be never-ending, but so is our determination to sharpen our skills and stand up""."	/news/business-63075729

fact that Mark Attanasio and his entourage travelled to Carrow Road to watch their final top flight game for some time indicates that this is much more than a passing interest. Current majority shareholders Delia Smith and Michael Wynn-Jones are now both in their 80s and it is clear a succession plan is required as a potential new era arrives at the club. 
In a recent interview recorded with the club's in-house media team, sporting director Stuart Webber hinted at exciting news coming for fans who had to endure a tough campaign for the Canaries. It is fair to guess a cash injection could be that tonic that lifts spirits around Carrow Road. 
Norwich have tried hard to stay in the so-called best league in the world with a ""self-funding"" model, is this set to be abandoned in favour of more traditional approach with a wealthier backer? Time will tell. 
About 200 fans showed their frustration at another relegation after just one season in the top flight by gathering outside the ground on Sunday.
feat was the Canaries' 26th from 38 games.

business	Female avatar sexually assaulted in Meta VR platform, campaigners say	"Campaigners say the avatar of a 21-year-old researcher was sexually assaulted in Meta's virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds.
Corporate accountability group SumOfUs, for whom the researcher works, says it shows Meta needs better plans to mitigate harms in the metaverse.
Meta's annual shareholder meeting takes place on Wednesday.
mpany told the BBC there were safety tools in Horizon Worlds to help people have a ""positive experience"".
Noting that Meta had not yet seen the full SumOfUs report, a spokesperson told the BBC the firm wanted everyone in Horizon Worlds to access the safety procedures ""and help us investigate and take action"".
Horizon Worlds is currently only available to users in the US and Canada. Avatars in the platform have a simplified, cartoonish appearance.
SumOfUs says that virtual assaults can be intensely traumatic.
""It still counts, it still has a real impact on users,"" the group's campaigns director Vicky Wyatt told the BBC Tech Tent podcast.
Ms Wyatt said the researcher subjected to the alleged assault felt that ""part of them was really shocked, part of them thought, 'OK, this isn't my real body, this is an avatar' and another part of them thought 'this is really, really important research that I'm doing, I need to capture this footage'"".
BBC has seen some of that footage. The avatar of the researcher is not in vision, as it is taken from her perspective, but there are two male avatars in the room, one of whom is observing while the other appears very close to her. The pair make lewd comments and share a virtual bottle of drink.
re is no single agreed definition of the metaverse, and proponents admit it is a work-in-progress.
It draws upon several different pre-existing technologies, including virtual reality and augmented reality.
metaverse is not a single space, and many different 3D virtual environments - including established games and virtual worlds - are said to be part of it. 
Of the parts of the metaverse that presently exist, only some - such as Horizon Worlds - are owned by Meta. However, the company has championed the idea, is investing billions of dollars in developing the concept and plans to hire thousands of staff to work on it.
Earlier reports of virtual assaults on avatars and inappropriate ""creepy"" behaviour prompted Meta to introduce new safeguards into its virtual worlds in February
Personal Boundary prevents avatars from coming within a set distance of each other, making it easier to avoid these unwanted interactions.
It stops others ""invading your avatar's personal space"", said Meta.
""If someone tries to enter your Personal Boundary, the system will halt their forward movement as they reach the boundary.""
According to Meta, the default Personal Boundary setting is roughly 4ft (1.2m) virtual distance between your avatar and those of anyone not on your friends list.
mpany says it also offers a number of ways to block and report users.
According to SumOfUs, the researcher was ""encouraged"" to disable the Personal Boundary feature.
researcher also witnessed homophobic slurs and virtual gun violence, the group claims.
SumOfUS has filed a resolution with a small group of shareholders, asking for a risk assessment of the human rights impacts of the metaverse to be conducted by the company. 
group also criticised a recent blog post by Meta's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg.
In it, he wrote: ""We wouldn't hold a bar manager responsible for real-time speech moderation in their bar, as if they should stand over your table, listen intently to your conversation, and silence you if they hear things they don't like."" 
Ms Wyatt says that Meta needs to act now to tackle issues: ""Rather than Facebook rushing headlong into building this metaverse, we're saying look, you need to stop look at all the harms that are happening on your platforms right now that you can't even deal with. 
""Let's not repeat and replicate those in the metaverse. We need a better plan here on how to mitigate online harms in the metaverse""."	/news/technology-61573661

Channel 4's two-part film is titled Vardy v Rooney: A Courtroom Drama.
work said it would recreate the ""high drama, high stakes High Court defamation case that followed"" Mrs Rooney's now-infamous social media post in 2019, in which she accused Vardy of leaking private stories about her to the press.
roadcaster said the case ""had a huge impact on the lives of the two women at its heart and catapulted the two sparring legal teams into the spotlight where, much like Rooney and Vardy, their every move in the courtroom was dissected and scrutinised in the press"".
Vardy's barrister, Hugh Tomlinson, will be portrayed by Simon Coury, best known for appearing in The Professor And The Madman.
Rooney's husband, the footballer Wayne Rooney, will be played by Dion Lloyd and Jamie Vardy by Marci Nagyszokolyai.
w has been created from the court transcripts and will air before the end of the year.
It is not the only TV show exploring the case - in August, Disney+ confirmed it was creating a three-part documentary series about the court battle with ""exclusive access"" to Coleen Rooney.
BBC is also understood to be working on its own documentary, made by Curious Films.
Earlier this summer, Vardy, 40, lost her libel battle against 36-year-old Rooney, who said she had carried out a months-long sting operation to uncover who had been passing information about her to the Sun newspaper.
A High Court judge found Mrs Rooney's allegation was ""substantially true"".
Mrs Rooney's sleuthing efforts saw her dubbed Wagatha Christie in reference to the popular mystery writer Agatha Christie.

business	UK to cut import taxes from some of world's poorest countries	"UK is to cut import taxes on hundreds more products from some of the world's poorest countries to boost trade links. 
Developing Countries Trading Scheme comes into force in January and builds on a scheme the UK was first part of while a member of the European Union.
Goods such as clothes, shoes and foods not widely produced in the UK will benefit from lower or zero tariffs. 
me covers 65 developing countries. 
It is on top of the thousands of products which developing nations can already export to the UK without tariffs and will affect around 99% of goods imported from Africa.
Department for International Trade said the work was part of a wider push by the UK to use trade to ""drive prosperity and help eradicate poverty"", as well as reduce dependency on aid. 
me includes powers to suspend a country on the grounds of human rights or labour violations, as well as for not meeting their climate change obligations. 
International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: ""As an independent trading nation, we are taking back control of our trade policy and making decisions that back UK businesses, help with the cost of living, and support the economies of developing countries around the world.
""UK businesses can look forward to less red-tape and lower costs, incentivising firms to import goods from developing countries.""
Many goods, from textiles to fruit, in 65 of the world's poorest nations already benefit from reduced or zero tariffs when sold to the UK, making them more appealing. 
w scheme cuts some of those charges further - for example, on cucumbers which can not be produced here during the winter. 
It also simplifies the rules for which items, such as some textiles, qualify for preferential treatment. 
ges could save importers millions of pounds - although, even if passed on in full, the price savings for consumers may be marginal. 
Coming when aid to developing countries has been reduced, the scheme underlines a government policy of using trade instead. 
me removes some seasonal tariffs on products like cucumbers, which cannot be grown in the UK in the winter, so they are tariff-free during this period for the majority of countries under the scheme. 
It also simplifies trade rules such as rules of origin, which dictate what proportion of a product must be made in its country of origin. 
Mohammed Jabbar, managing director of DBL Group, a textile business from Bangladesh, said this was a ""game changer"" for his company. 
""[The changes] mean we will be able to source our cotton from many more countries than we could before, which will make the business more competitive and our supply chains a lot more resilient,"" he said. "	/news/business-62557128

Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) said the athletes with ""ties to the Olympic movement"" had arrived in recent months following a 12-month project to bring them to safety.
In all, 31 family members have resettled in the country since June. 
""It's been a journey for me but I am very happy to be here,"" said Yousofi. 
""I am essentially starting a new life here.""
Sprinter Yousofi, 26, carried Afghanistan's flag at the opening ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games - which were postponed until last year because of the coronavirus pandemic - and took part in the women's 100m event. 
She is now hoping to compete at the Paris Olympics in 2024. 
""I am going to be training very hard, it would be exciting to go to Paris,"" she added.
Asian Games taekwondo medallist Ahmad Abasy was also part of the group relocated down under.
AOC liaised with the Australian government to secure visas and flights for the Afghan arrivals, while the International Olympic Committee (IOC) provided financial support during their time in interim locations.
""For the families involved, the stress and uncertainty over this time has been enormous,"" said AOC chief executive Matt Carroll. 
""Many have spent time in locations outside Afghanistan and it's wonderful to now have them on Australian soil. All arrived happy, if exhausted.

sports	Nick Bollettieri: Former players pay tribute after 'pioneer' tennis coach dies aged 91	"The mould-breaking and hugely charismatic tennis coach Nick Bollettieri has died aged 91.
New Yorker guided 10 world number one singles players, including Andre Agassi, Maria Sharapova, Monica Seles and Boris Becker. 
Bollettieri first established his eponymous academy in 1978, and before long students were living and training full-time in Bradenton, Florida.
With his deep tan and wrap-around sunglasses, Bollettieri worked his pupils extremely hard, and changed the face of tennis coaching.
""You were a dreamer and a doer, and a pioneer in our sport - truly one of a kind,"" former world number two Tommy Haas said in a tribute. 
Sabine Lisicki - runner-up at Wimbledon in 2013 - said Bollettieri ""shaped the game of tennis"".
""You have given so many children a place to work for their dream,"" she added.
""Supporting them with your knowledge and the belief that anything is possible.""
Bollettieri was never an elite player. He started offering tennis lessons shortly after his release from the US Army's 187th Airborne Division in 1957.
It was to his academy that Sharapova's father first turned, when his daughter arrived in the US aged six. Initially too young to board, the Russian later described it as a ""tennis prison"". The routine and repetition fashioned many champions, even if Sharapova felt there was not enough work on the technical aspects of the game. 
Agassi used similar language in his autobiography, referring to his fellow students as ""inmates."" He was another who did not enjoy his tennis education. The American rebelled frequently against the system, and has recalled Bollettieri's anger after he played a final in jeans, makeup and earrings.
But the partnership endured. As a travelling coach, Bollettieri is most closely associated with Agassi, and the 1992 Wimbledon Championships. Agassi won his first Grand Slam on Centre Court, with Bollettieri wiping away tears in the players' box.
Williams sisters, Jim Courier and Martina Hingis are among the other great champions to have benefitted from Bollettieri's experience, and current director of the IMG Academy - the modern iteration of Bollettieri's academy - Jimmy Arias said: ""Tennis wouldn't be where it is today without Nick's influence.""
He had an extraordinary presence. 'Holy mackerel!' was his catchphrase; tennis was his life. 
Bollettieri was a natural on camera and we always looked forward to his appearances in the BBC Radio commentary box at Wimbledon in more recent years.
With a winning smile, and a wonderful turn of phrase, he brought the language and glamour of New York City to Centre Court."	/sport/tennis/63862938
health	Mental health patients sent miles due to bed shortage	"Hundreds of mental health patients in England are sent to hospitals miles from home each month because of local bed shortages - more than a year after the NHS aimed to end the practice.
NHS data shows that 630 patients were in inappropriate out of area placements (OAPs) at the end of August 2022.
Experts say such placements, which the NHS said would end by March 2021, are traumatic for patients and costly.
government said it was investing an extra £2.3bn in mental health services.
An inappropriate OAP is when someone is sent to a hospital in a different area because no beds are free locally. 
Of the 630 patients in inappropriate OAPs in August 2022, more than half were sent away that month. 
In 2019, Kelly was sectioned and - because no local bed was free - sent to a hospital 23 miles from her home. 
""I didn't have anything on me"", she says, ""I only had my phone and the clothes that I was in.""
With family members too far away to bring her possessions, the hospital provided basics: pyjamas, trousers, a T-shirt, one pair of socks and two pieces of underwear. 
""All I could wear were the pyjamas and the same top and trousers every day for three weeks,"" says Kelly.
""It was just awful. When you're stuck in a strange place as it is... It's even more distressing not having your own familiar things to take comfort in.""
Shortly after her discharge, Kelly was sectioned again - this time closer to home. She says this made a ""massive difference"", adding: ""When you're closer to home you've got your friends and your family coming to visit you and take you out for a walk.""
Paul Spencer, the charity Mind's head of health, policy & campaigns, describes OAPs as traumatic, isolating and costly to the NHS. He says that ""people are cut off from their support networks right at the very moment they need them most"".
More than half of patients are sent more than 60 miles (100km) from home. 
Dr Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says ""statistically, if you're sent away from your local area, you stay in hospital longer"".
""For some areas it looks like there aren't enough beds and for some areas, it is that there aren't alternatives to admission. Focusing on care in the community is really important,"" says Dr James.
Almost £10m was spent on inappropriate OAPs in August, with 94% of placement days spent with private organisations. Private beds are often more expensive.
NHS had planned to eliminate inappropriate OAPs in adult acute inpatient care by 2020-21. 
Since that deadline, 5,800 patients have been sent on inappropriate OAPs. This has cost the NHS more than £165m. 
""It's incredibly disheartening to see progress stall on reversing the number of inappropriate OAPs"", says Mr Spencer. 
""We know that it is possible to stop OAPs and some trusts are doing much better than others. Over the coming year we need a sharper focus in those areas where people are being repeatedly let down. 
""We need the prime minister to urgently recommit to delivering a cross-government mental health plan.""
An NHS spokesperson said: ""Mental health services are committed to ending inappropriate OAPs as quickly and as safely as possible and the number of new patients sent out of area has halved over the last three years.
""While the pandemic has led to a significant increase in service pressures through a combination of a high number of bed closures, staff absences, and higher levels of mental health need - the NHS has treated tens of thousands more people in the community since the publication of the NHS Long Term Plan and will continue to work with social care colleagues to reduce rising length of stay in mental health settings."" 
Across England, patients spent a total of 191,515 inappropriate OAPs days in the year ending this August, down 19% from the year before. 
But 25 trusts saw an increase in the number of days patients spent in OAPs, with 12 trusts recording their highest figure of OAP days yet. 
When Claire, not her real name, was suicidal in 2020, she was sent to a private hospital 80 miles away. She spent 18 months there. 
""I had no idea where I was going. They said there were no beds in our local area and brought me to East Sussex. I've never stepped foot in East Sussex before,"" she says.
""I was terrified. I was hundreds of miles away from my family. I was asking to go home, to see my mum. I didn't know the psychiatrists, I didn't know the people there.""
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Everyone should have access to safe, appropriate mental health care close to home, and while the pandemic has had a significant impact on capacity in mental health services, we remain committed to reducing inappropriate OAPs for patients.""
rtment said it is investing an extra £2.3bn annually in mental health services by 2024. NHS England is providing an extra £10m to support mental health services this winter to ""deal with record demand"".
If you are affected by issues raised, support is available at the BBC Action Line.
Note: Data is provisional and subject to change. Not all trusts submit OAP data; this August, 79% participated. NHS Digital says a cyber incident may have had ""limited"" impact on participation."	/news/uk-england-63596763
health	Long Covid: What's changed, and what we know now	"More than two million people in the UK say they have symptoms of long Covid, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey.
Many long Covid patients now report Omicron was their first infection - and I'm one of them.
But almost three years into the pandemic there is still a struggle to be seen by specialist clinics, which are hampered by a lack of resources and research.
Has the condition changed at all, and have treatments started to progress?
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence defines long Covid, or post-Covid syndrome, as symptoms during or after infection that continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. 
An estimated 1.2m of those who answered the ONS survey reported at least one such symptom continuing for more than 12 weeks - health issues that they didn't think could be explained by anything else.
It's easy to assume that new cases of long Covid have significantly decreased, given recent research suggesting the risk of developing long Covid from the Omicron variant is lower.
However, the sheer scale of cases over the past year has resulted in more than a third of people with long Covid acquiring it during the Omicron wave, according to the ONS. 
mptoms reported by newer long Covid sufferers are still broadly similar: weakness or tiredness, difficulty concentrating, shortness of breath and muscle aches are mentioned most often.
What might be surprising is that for many of these people the severity of their long Covid has not diminished.
After going through a mild Covid infection myself in January, two weeks after returning to work I rapidly went downhill and ended up taking a month off work being closely monitored by doctors and hospital specialists.
Over the following months I spent most days in bed due to fatigue and severe joint pain, and struggled to walk more than a short distance without chest pain. 
I experienced significant cognitive issues with memory, speech and hearing, developed pleurisy, and even a reactivated Epstein-Barr virus responsible for my long-forgotten bout of glandular fever more than a decade ago.
I was officially diagnosed with long Covid after 12 weeks and had gone from balancing a demanding job going into the office throughout the pandemic alongside exercise, hobbies and nights out to requiring help with basic tasks and rarely leaving my bedroom. 
It's now been 10 months, and I still experience chronic pain, brain fog, and muscle twitching and I struggle to do simple housework or activities even after taking a prescribed cocktail of painkillers and supplements.
Patients like me are usually referred to post-Covid assessment clinics after experiencing symptoms for 12 weeks - however, waiting times have not improved much within the past year.
NHS England figures show 33% of Londoners given an initial assessment had to wait 15 weeks or more from the time of their referral, compared to 39% from a similar period in 2021.
Long Covid treatment across NHS services in England still varies hugely too, according to the Royal College of Nursing, with some services treating it as a physical condition but others as psychological.
After waiting more than 19 weeks I was finally assessed in August but was left feeling hopeless, with a one-hour Zoom call offering diet and pain management advice - but no further investigations, referrals or treatment.
British Medical Association (BMA) has called on the government to increase funding for long Covid clinics to deal with ever-increasing patient numbers. The BMA says that NHS England's 2022 strategy set out in July failed to announce any new funding.
Despite this, research efforts are gathering pace and one long Covid clinic in central London is taking part in a study to gain a better understanding of how health systems respond to people living with the illness, and its effects.
University College Hospital in Fitzrovia is one of six sites taking part in the Stimulate ICP research project.
Staff there have seen 4,200 patients since May 2020 and on average 120 people a week are treated, 40 of whom are new referrals.
Dr Melissa Heightman, who runs the clinic, explained that patients begin with a consultation to understand their symptoms, and are then offered targeted treatment and rehabilitation.
re is no one theory as to what causes long Covid, Dr Heightman said, but thanks to the ongoing research her team are now ""increasingly recognising the patterns of illness and they're not a surprise to doctors"".
""We're learning a lot about this condition and are really finding improved ways to speed up people's recovery,"" she said, adding: ""One of the things we're looking at is whether medicines used in similar scenarios could be used for long Covid illness.""
Sophia Pemberton, a 31-year-old special needs teacher, had her first appointment at the clinic after living with symptoms since she caught Covid in March 2020.
where she worked remained open throughout the lockdowns, and Sophia explained that even as more people caught Covid she ""naively thought it'd be just like a cold"", until she became ill herself.
""Things just didn't really get any better. It took months and months to build up the stamina to get to the end of my street,"" she said.
Sophia experiences breathlessness, pain, fatigue, brain fog, muscle twitching, sleep problems and more, and has tried a variety of pain medications.
She has had to go part time at work and ""can't do anything"" once she gets home at the end of the day.
""I use a walking aid now because my balance has been badly affected,"" she said.
""It's absolute exhaustion to the point of not being able to move some days; not being able to lift up a fork to feed myself.""
r said she had no health issues before and used to play lots of sports, but now even struggles to do everyday tasks.
""Things that I took for granted, even cooking and cleaning, I rely heavily on my husband for now. I didn't ever think at my age that would be necessary,"" she said.
upport group I belong to has more than 56,000 members and one topic that leads discussions is wider acceptance of long Covid.
Many people report falling out with friends, family and even their marriages breaking down due to a lack of support or understanding about their illness.
Some, including me, have also been targeted by strangers on public transport because they are taking measures to protect themselves from re-infection by wearing a mask.
Sophia says that a lack of compassion for the condition has also made her life even more difficult: ""People don't get it. I'm constantly having to explain and it's really hard to get through to people.
""To a large degree people want Covid to be over, and to hear about people suffering doesn't really compute with the idea that it's 'all gone' and in the past.""
For the two million people in the UK estimated to be dealing with the life-changing effects of the condition, they too wish that it was over - but are relying on new research, improved treatment, and kindness from others until that time comes.

technology	'5G makes my phone pretty worthless'	"In a weird way, a rock gig first led me to question the UK's 5G provision.
I was at a sold-out concert at London's O2 arena, had 5G reception on my phone but was unable to share the moment on social media.
I thought that was odd - 5G was designed to cope with lots of devices using it simultaneously, something its predecessors 4G and 3G struggled with as anyone who has tried to use their phone in a crowded place such as a festival or football match will probably have noticed.
A few days later, trying to use Google Maps, with 5G on my phone and apparently decent reception, I received an error message - the signal was too poor for the app to function.
I started taking screenshots of these messages and ended up with quite a library. Eventually, I shared some online - and then, other frustrated 5G users contacted me. 
We had various handsets and network providers but were all experiencing similar problems. 
Patrick, from Bristol, told me he could not refresh social-media apps, load maps or check Amazon order statuses while using 5G.
""It's really frustrating,"" he said. 
""5G was promised to be incredibly fast across the country. And if anything, it's worse than what we had already. It's not acceptable.""
Jon, from Yorkshire, said he could not access any data via 5G during his train commute to Leeds, which affected his job. 
""It makes my phone pretty worthless,"" he said.
A woman from Manchester said any 5G coverage appearing was ""still a surprise"".
re were many others.
And in Glasgow city centre, some colleagues and I found the 5G speed half that of the 4G, according to a basic speed checker.
So what is going on?
ustry insists, still only three years in to a 10-year rollout plan, everything is fine.
5G has received lots of investment from the mobile operators and government and is hailed as a faster, more reliable connection.
But it has faced several setbacks.
5G requires a lot of masts because it delivers faster speeds over shorter distances.
With a higher frequency than 4G, some say it is harmful - although, tests have found the opposite. And it has been falsely linked to the spread of Covid-19.
Gareth Elliott, of the industry trade association Mobile UK, said local objections and the need to obtain planning permission were obstacles to expanding national coverage.
""We are working with communities, working with local authorities and we do aim to extend 5G coverage as quickly as possible,"" he said.
""The closer you live or work to a mast, the better signal you have.""
In 2020, UK mobile networks were ordered to strip out kit made by Chinese technology company Huawei from all 5G infrastructure, after it was deemed a national security risk.
for completing this were recently extended. 
UK's major networks, EE, O2, Three and Vodafone, told me they were on track to meet them, happy with the progress of their rollouts, their customers generally satisfied with the service - and people tended not to notice when networks were working efficiently.
But analyst Ian Fogg, from the company OpenSignal, said the 5G experience had been oversold by over-enthusiastic marketeers.
Coverage was generally better in cities and operators varied, he said - but, overall, it was still an improvement on 4G.
""Companies talking up 5G are often thinking not just about what's here now but what we'll be having in 18 months, two or three years time. So there's that expectation of, 'This is what it's going to do.' We're seeing some of that improvement now - but not all of it,"" Mr Fogg said.
CCS Insight chief analyst Ben Wood agrees.
""The networks need to be very careful that there is not a huge gap between the rhetoric and the reality of the experience,"" he said.
Department for Digital Culture, Media and Sport, which oversees mobile networks, and Ofcom, the regulator, declined to be interviewed - but Ofcom did tell me only about 10% of people in the UK currently owned 5G-enabled phones. 
Most new devices do now work on 5G - but people are holding on to older handsets for longer. 5G contracts do not cost extra - but it does burn through data a lot more quickly for those not on unlimited plans.
And there is another issue.
""We are using something called non-standalone 5G, which is the very first version of 5G,"" Mr Wood said. 
""It only delivers the 5G signal from the handset to the tower. Everything behind that is still 4G.
""The goal is to get to a fully integrated end-to-end 5G network - but in the UK, no networks have deployed that yet.""
And this could have a significant impact on the experience.
m is for 5G to be the infrastructure that will one day underpin driverless cars communicating with each other and street furniture such as signs and traffic lights. 
It can reliably connect hospitals with ambulances, to share patient data and treatment advice as they travel.
And it enables better virtual- and mixed-reality environments for teaching, training and socialising. 
At the 5G and 6G Innovation Centre, at Surrey University, I tried out a demo using a basic robot. 
With 5G connectivity, the robot responded immediately to my commands, via an Xbox controller, for it to move. 
But when we switched down to 4G, the momentary delay between me touching the controller and the robot receiving the instruction - this is called latency - resulted in drama. It faltered, and then fell rather heavily, taking me down with it.
fference between the two was, quite literally, striking. But it would be - there was a 5G mast directly outside the window.

health	Doctors in Wales consider striking for the first time	"Doctors in Wales are considering going on strike for the first time.
Almost two-thirds of hospital doctors surveyed by the British Medical Association (BMA) Cymru said they would be willing to take some form of industrial action. 
BMA's Welsh Council chairwoman, Dr Iona Collins, said the result of the survey was ""upsetting to all"".
Welsh government said it understands the strength of feeling among doctors about the pay offer.
BMA Cymru Wales said the starting salary is £26,000, with junior doctors in training programmes for between five and 11 years if they are training full-time, or longer if training less-than-full-time or with breaks.  
Dr Iona Collins added that it was ""gut-wrenching for doctors to consider walking away from work"".
""Without action now, patients will continue to suffer as a direct consequence of an under-funded NHS with insufficient direct clinical care.""
uncement comes after a week of walkouts by nurses and ambulance staff across the country calling for better wages and conditions.
Industrial action may include strike action over their current pay and conditions.
BMA announced in October that a ballot for industrial action by junior doctors in England - who received a 2% pay increase this year - would open on 9 January.
union said that over the past 15 years, junior doctors' take-home pay has been cut in real terms by more than a quarter.
Just under 1,000 doctors in Wales responded to the questionnaire seeking views on the latest pay award from the Welsh government of 4.5%, with 78% of those who answered saying they want a pay rise that matched or exceeded inflation.
A previous survey undertaken by the BMA in August found that 52% of members who responded were more likely to leave the Welsh NHS as a result of the below inflation pay rise.
Dr Iona Collins said: ""Doctors have been quietly quitting the NHS for years, by reducing their contracted hours or leaving altogether. The financial incentive to remain in the NHS has eroded over the last decade.
""A change in NHS pension taxation has seen senior doctors who have worked overtime in good faith punished for propping up the NHS by paying more than the overtime pay back as pension tax.
""No other healthcare system devalues their doctors like this, so there is little wonder that so many doctors leave the NHS to work elsewhere.""
Dr Collins said she had called for an urgent meeting with Wales' health minister Eluned Morgan to discuss the survey and ""need for immediate action"". 
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Dr Collins said: ""Junior doctors are having to pay their tuition fees - it's a long course, the medical course. The tuition fees alone are upwards of £9,200 alone a year and you've got to keep yourself fed and watered. 
""Doctors are tired, they are overworked. Staff are having to work under tremendous pressure. 
""Then you have lovely encouraging adverts from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and the Middle East saying 'why don't you come and work with us? We will pay you so much better with a work force and a workplace being such a less challenging environment'.""
Welsh government said: ""We understand the strength of feeling among doctors about the pay offer and the pressures all public sector workers are under due to the cost-of-living crisis. 
""We will continue to work to bring together trade unions, employers and government to deliver the best possible outcomes for workers, while continuing to call on the UK government to use the funding it has to provide a fair pay offer to NHS staff and enable us to do the same in Wales.""   
It comes as GMB members of the ambulance service in Wales took part in a strike on Wednesday in a dispute over pay.
Executive medical director at Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board, Dr Nick Lyons, said he thought his staff managed ""better than expected"" as a result of the strikes. 
""It's been a really tough three days here. We faced incredible pressures on the system last weekend and declared a critical incident on Monday,"" he said.
""There's been two days of incredible hard work by 19,000 staff looking after our patients for Christmas."""	/news/uk-wales-64062631

business	Union calls for more Royal Mail strikes after new pay offer	"union representing Royal Mail workers is set to renew calls for strike action, calling the company's latest pay offer ""unacceptable"".
Royal Mail Group said it had put forward a deal, which included a pay rise worth 7% of a worker's salary over two years, and a 2% lump sum this year.
However, Royal Mail said the offer was subject to agreeing to changes with Sunday working and start times.
Union bosses accused the company of ""imposing change not negotiating"".
Communication Workers Union (CWU) said it would meet on Tuesday to call for strikes, after it previously called off planned walkouts on Sunday.
CWU has been locked in a long-running dispute with Royal Mail over pay increases keeping up with the soaring cost of living and working practices.
median pay at Royal Mail is £32,465 a year, with the average pay for a postal delivery worker lower than that at £25,777. 
Royal Mail has blamed strike action for rising losses and job cuts, as well as lower volumes of parcels being posted.
Its chief executive, Simon Thompson, said the company had reported losses of £219m in the first half of 2022, which demonstrated the ""need for change at Royal Mail is urgent"".
""We have always been clear that the more we can change the business, the more we will be able to pay our people - both now and in the future,"" he added.
Royal Mail has not provided specific details of the changes to working patterns, but said its pay offer was subject to the union agreeing to ""changes to Sunday working, start times and flexible working, so that Royal Mail can re-invent and compete in the growing parcels market"".
Mr Thompson urged union bosses to ""accept the change and pay offer without delay"".
ks between the union and the company have been held at the conciliation service Acas, and planned strikes in the next two weeks were called off following a legal challenge by the company.
union said on Monday the latest offer included ""more unacceptable changes"" and a ""derisory 7% two-year pay offer that is well below projected inflation for both years"".
""This reaffirms the company's whole approach of imposing change rather than negotiating it,"" the CWU added.
""Not only is the offer not applicable to Parcelforce and fleet employees, but the company have confirmed that, as of tomorrow, new entrants will be brought in on lower terms, and will be introducing owner-drivers into Royal Mail - a service that will be comparable to Uber."""	/news/business-63459389
technology	TikTok Invisible Challenge: Nigerians warned against naked video trend	"Nigeria's telecommunications agency has warned a new TikTok trend called the Invisible Challenge could expose devices to malware. 
raze urges users to film themselves naked, then to use TikTok's ""Invisible Body"" filter to replace their body with a blurry background.
But officials say some users have started attaching a link to videos which downloads a virus onto devices.
Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) says users' data is then stolen.
Attackers are attracting users by uploading videos to TikTok as part of the trend, but attaching a link to a software known as ""unfilter"", which claims to be able to remove the filter from the video. 
kers hope the link will trick people into thinking they will see the naked body behind the video. 
Instead, the NCC says people who click on the link or attempt will then have their devices infected with a virus called WASP or W4SP stealer. 
Once downloaded, the malware has ''critical damage potential'' to victims because it illegally harvests their important information - including passwords, financial activity, keystrokes from emails and chat programmes.
Nigerian authorities have also warned that the malware might be ''capable of covertly collecting screenshots, video recordings, or the ability to activate any connected camera or microphone"".
Authorities have advised Nigerians to avoid clicking on suspicious links and to always use anti-malware software on their mobile phones and computers, as well as embrace ''healthy password hygiene practices"". 
Nigeria has seen a rapid increase in TikTok users in recent years, particularly among young people. 
Last month, two TikTok stars in the northern state of Kano were sentenced to a whipping and forced to clean the court after they used social media to mock a government official.

Chief nursing officer Mel Roberts said there had been an increased number of people coming to A&E with flu.

Customers in seven states claimed the technology giant had sold the ""butterfly"" keyboards, on MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops, from 2015 to 2019, knowing they had unresponsive and sticky keys that could be damaged by dust or debris.

politics	Tory MPs say they will continue naming asylum hotels	"Some Tory MPs have vowed not to be ""silenced"", after a refugee charity called for politicians to stop naming hotels housing people seeking asylum.
Refugee Council has written to the Commons Speaker urging him to ask MPs not to identify hotels to protect the safety of those staying there.
But several Tories said they would still ""name and shame"" hotels getting taxpayer money to house migrants.
UK spends almost £7m a day on hotels for asylum seekers and refugees.
Last month an immigration processing centre in Dover, Kent, was firebombed in an attack police have said was motivated by extreme right-wing terrorist ideology. 
In the Refugee Council letter, first reported by the Guardian, the charity's chief executive Enver Soloman said the ""horrific"" incident highlighted how asylum seekers were vulnerable to violent attacks by extremists. 
""It has been Home Office practice to not publicly name hotels where people are staying in order to guard their safety and privacy, but we know that increasingly MPs are naming specific premises when they raise this issue,"" he wrote. 
""It is of course right that MPs should be able to raise any constituency issue in Parliament, but this can be done without identifying a specific hotel and potentially making it more vulnerable to attack.""
Campaign group Hope Not Hate said it had recorded 182 visits from anti-immigration activists to migrant accommodation sites so far this year, some of which involved asylum seekers and security staff being harassed and filmed. 
However, Tory MP Lee Anderson, who represents Ashfield, wrote on Facebook: ""Like many of you, I am sick and tired of seeing our hospitality abused and people who are simply economic migrants cheating our system via small boats and dodgy human rights legislation.
""I will not be silenced and will name and shame these greedy hotel owners.""
Brendan Clarke-Smith, Tory MP for Bassetlaw, said he would always be ""welcoming to those in genuine need"" but posted a similar message, saying: ""I will not be silenced and will use the privileges given to me as a Member of Parliament to continue to speak out on this issue.""
Former Conservative minister David Davis has also raised concerns about plans to house asylum seekers at a specific hotel in his constituency of Haltemprice and Howden, as well as another which is already being used for the purpose. 
In response to the Refugee Council letter, he told the BBC: ""In most cases, and in most constituencies, the housing arrangements of migrants are hardly a secret.
""It is normally the case that hotels, or other facilities, housing migrants or asylum seekers [are] well known so I cannot see any strength in calls to restrict the freedom of speech of Members of Parliament in this matter.""
He added: ""It is particularly important for MPs to speak out about the housing of migrants in their constituency when it directly relates to the provision of services on which our constituents and the migrants rely such as healthcare and education.""
Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson, who chairs the Commons home affairs committee, said there was ""little to be gained from publicising the exact hotels"" asylum seekers were staying in, which she said could put them ""at greater risk"". 
A spokeswoman for Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle declined to comment.
Meanwhile, Home Office Minister Robert Jenrick suggested the government may have to ask rural areas and smaller towns to accommodate more migrants if the number of arrivals remained high. 
government is under pressure to tackle the increasing number of people crossing the Channel in small boats. 
Over the weekend the number of migrants who had made the dangerous journey so far this year passed 40,000 - the highest number since figures began to be collected in 2018.

politics	NI Protocol: UK-Irish relations have improved significantly - Irish PM	"UK and Irish government relations have ""improved significantly"" in recent weeks, Micheál Martin has said.
(Irish prime minister) made the comments at the end of the latest British-Irish Council summit.
On Thursday, he met UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for the first time, with both leaders saying a ""breakthrough"" on the NI Protocol is possible.
Mr Martin said there was a ""window of opportunity"" but declined to be drawn on how long negotiations could last.
He said the decision to extend the deadline for forming a Stormont executive into 2023, and delaying the legal requirement for an assembly election had been helpful.
Mr Sunak was the first prime minister to attend a meeting of the British-Irish Council, held this time in Blackpool, since 2007, and the first ever Conservative PM to take part.
After his meeting with the taoiseach he was confident that ""with goodwill and pragmatism"" a breakthrough can happen on the protocol.
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney had previously criticised the approach of the UK government to the protocol during Boris Johnson and Liz Truss's premierships, saying it had badly fractured Anglo-Irish relations.
Asked to sum up how he viewed the relationship now, Mr Martin said things had improved greatly.
""A week is a long time in politics, months can be an eternity,"" he added.
He said that he did not ""understate the difficulties"" in reaching a deal that would have the support of all parties in Northern Ireland and that he appreciated the concerns expressed by the Democratic Unionist Party.
DUP has blocked the formation of an executive and assembly in Northern Ireland in its protest against the protocol.
-Brexit trading mechanism allows free trade to continue across the Irish land border, but it has also added some new checks to goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, who chaired the council summit, said it was disappointing that no Stormont ministers were able to attend.
k means there are no executive ministers in place, meaning the only representative from Northern Ireland at the summit was Jayne Brady, the head of the civil service.
Mr Gove said he hoped that by the time the next meeting happens in summer 2023, a first and deputy first minister will be attending from Northern Ireland.
Mr Martin added that he wants to see a deal between the UK and EU ""as soon as possible"".
DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party had been patient and a negotiated outcome was the ""only basis for Stormont's power-sharing arrangements to prosper"".

business	Ryanair boss hits out at airports: 'They had one job'	"A Ryanair boss has criticised airports for not recruiting enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they had ""had one job to do to"".
Neil Sorahan, chief financial officer, said ""various governments"" and airports needed to be held to account for ""not staffing up appropriately"".
His comments come as staff shortages at airports have led to major disruption and cancellations in recent months.
Airports said they had been recruiting security staff since late last year. 
A spokesperson for the Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents most UK airports ranging from Heathrow to Edinburgh, said: ""The vast majority of passengers across the UK are now getting away on their holidays with no or minimal disruption.""
kesperson added that it was ""essential"" the industry worked together to fill the remaining vacancies, including for airline ground handling staff. 
Mr Sorahan, who said Ryanair was having a ""phenomenal"" summer as the airline posted profits of €170m (£145m) for the three months to the end of June, told the BBC's Today programme the ""biggest issue"" the company had faced was ""air traffic control disruptions all across Europe"".
""You have to hold ANSPs [air navigation service providers] and various governments to account in relation to not staffing up appropriately for that,"" he said.
""Equally the airports themselves, they had one job to do to and that was to make sure they have sufficient handlers and security staff. They had the schedules months in advance.
""We managed to staff up for 73 additional aircrafts well in advance and it's incumbent on the airports to get their planning better next year.""
After shedding thousands of jobs during the pandemic, the travel industry has struggled to recruit, train and security-check new staff quickly enough to keep up with resurgent demand.
Airlines have been blamed for taking more bookings than they can manage, while airports have also been criticised for not being able to cater for more flights.
Meanwhile, aviation industry leaders have argued the government could have done more to support the sector during the pandemic.
ustry has also been threatened by strike action, with many staff demanding pay rises to cope with the rising cost of living.
Ryanair has faced battles with unions after it cut salaries during the pandemic, but said it had agreed deals with more than 80% of its pilots and about 70% of cabin crews.
""We hope to conclude agreements with the small remaining balance in the near future,"" the group said.
Mr Sorahan told the BBC that any strike action that had taken place had a ""minimal impact"" on services.
Despite currently facing industrial disputes in France, Belgium and Spain over pay and conditions, Ryanair has suffered the least disruption and cancellations of major European carriers in recent months. 
In the first six months of 2022, Ryanair cancelled 0.3% of flights, compared with British Airways' total of 3.5%, and EasyJet's 2.8%, according to air travel consultancy OAG. 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary previously told the BBC that the company's ""strong balance sheet"" going into the pandemic enabled it to keep staff on, albeit on reduced pay, and maintain training at the height of Covid so they were able to ramp up operations when restrictions were lifted.
Mr Sorahan said Ryanair was ""fully staffed"" and operating more than 3,000 flights a day as many people venture on their first summer holiday since pandemic restrictions were lifted.
Ryanair said it remained ""confident that we can operate almost 100% of our scheduled flights, while minimising delays and disruptions for our guests and their families"".
rline said its passenger numbers had rebounded to 45.5 million - 9% higher than before the Covid pandemic - but its first quarter profits were still short of pre-Covid levels.
mpany said its fuel costs had soared by 560% to €1bn and added the Ukraine war had ""badly damaged"" Easter bookings and fares.
Mr O'Leary said in a statement on the company's results that unpredictability around fuel prices, the risk of new Covid variants and the war in Ukraine meant the company was unable to forecast a profit for the full financial year.
""While we remain hopeful that the high rate of vaccinations in Europe will allow the airline and tourism industry to fully recover and finally put Covid behind us, we cannot ignore the risk of new Covid variants in autumn 2022. Our experience... shows how fragile the travel market remains,"" he said.

fleshing out of the details of their economic plans on planning laws, energy, childcare, worker visas - will persuade markets that UK growth will accelerate. 
mbination of these reforms over the next few weeks and a medium-term plan to reduce the national debt, with ""iron discipline"" on existing spending plans, will, they argue, turn things around. 
g plans were set in cash terms last year. They do not account for 10% inflation. And the chancellor himself would not commit to updating benefits in line with inflation, as was previous policy. Pension increases will continue to be protected.
""fiscal surprise"" was ""small,"" a reference to the £2bn value of the scrapping of the 45p tax rate. That means it is not possible, say the government, to have caused the market chaos.
Instead they view the turmoil as the result of the US Federal Reserve aggressively hiking interest rates, partly leading to a strong dollar that helps rein in its inflation.
Ultimately, the plan is that the economic reform package will enable the Bank of England to bring down interest rates as quickly as possible after inflation is defeated.
what is underpinning the offensive from the prime minister and Cabinet. If it works, the markets will realise that they were wrong about the mini-budget, and the situation will recover. 
If it does not work there will be weeks of uncertainty as currency and borrowing markets continue to move wildly in response to every announcement, rumour of a statement or piece of economic data.
It is impossible to disentangle the market reaction from the politics. Already a small number of senior Conservatives are breaking ranks with their leadership on aspects of the mini-budget.
Amid all of this the independent financial watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) chairman will meet the prime minister in Downing Street.

health	Base editing: Revolutionary therapy clears girl's incurable cancer	"A teenage girl's incurable cancer has been cleared from her body in the first use of a revolutionary new type of medicine. 
All other treatments for Alyssa's leukaemia had failed.  
So doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital used ""base editing"" to perform a feat of biological engineering to build her a new living drug.
Six months later the cancer is undetectable, but Alyssa is still being monitored in case it comes back. 
Alyssa, who is 13 and from Leicester, was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in May last year. 
-cells are supposed to be the body's guardians - seeking out and destroying threats - but for Alyssa they had become the danger and were growing out of control. 
Her cancer was aggressive. Chemotherapy, and then a bone-marrow transplant, were unable to rid it from her body. 
Without the experimental medicine, the only option left would have been merely to make Alyssa as comfortable as possible. 
""Eventually I would have passed away,"" said Alyssa. Her mum, Kiona, said this time last year she had been dreading Christmas, ""thinking this is our last with her"". And then she ""just cried"" through her daughter's 13th birthday in January. 
What happened next would have been unthinkable just a few years ago and has been made possible by incredible advances in genetics. 
m at Great Ormond Street used a technology called base editing, which was invented only six years ago. 
Bases are the language of life. The four types of base - adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) - are the building blocks of our genetic code. Just as letters in the alphabet spell out words that carry meaning, the billions of bases in our DNA spell out the instruction manual for our body. 
Base editing allows scientists to zoom to a precise part of the genetic code and then alter the molecular structure of just one base, converting it into another and changing the genetic instructions. 
rge team of doctors and scientists used this tool to engineer a new type of T-cell that was capable of hunting down and killing Alyssa's cancerous T-cells. 
rted with healthy T-cells that came from a donor and set about modifying them.
final stage of genetic modification instructed the T-cells to go hunting for anything with the CD7 marking on it so that it would destroy every T-cell in her body - including the cancerous ones. That's why this marking has to be removed from the therapy - otherwise it would just destroy itself.  
If the therapy works, Alyssa's immune system - including T-cells - will be rebuilt with the second bone-marrow transplant.
When the idea was explained to the family, mum Kiona was left thinking: ""You can do that?"" It was Alyssa's decision to be the first to take the experimental therapy - which contained millions of the modified cells - in May this year.
""She's the first patient to be treated with this technology,"" said Prof Waseem Qasim, from UCL and Great Ormond Street. 
He said this genetic manipulation was a ""very fast-moving area of science"" with ""enormous potential"" across a range of diseases. 
Alyssa was left vulnerable to infection, as the designer cells attacked both the cancerous T-cells in her body and those that protect her from disease. 
After a month, Alyssa was in remission and was given a second bone-marrow transplant to regrow her immune system. 
Alyssa spent 16 weeks in hospital and couldn't see her brother, who was still going to school, in case he brought germs in. 
re were worries after the three-month check-up found signs of the cancer again. But her two most recent investigations have been clear. 
""You just learn to appreciate every little thing. I'm just so grateful that I'm here now,"" said Alyssa. 
""It's crazy. It's just amazing I've been able to have this opportunity, I'm very thankful for it and it's going to help other children, as well, in the future.""
She's eyeing-up Christmas, being a bridesmaid at her auntie's wedding, getting back on her bike, going back to school and ""just doing normal people stuff"".
family hope the cancer will never return, but are already grateful for the time it has bought them. 
""To have this extra year, this last three months when she's been home, has been a gift in itself,"" said Kiona.
Dad James said: ""I find it quite hard to talk about how proud we are. When you see what she's gone through and her vitality of life she's brought to every situation, it's outstanding.""
Most children with a leukaemia respond to the main treatments, but it is thought that up to a dozen a year could benefit from this therapy.
Alyssa is just the first of 10 people to be given the drug as part of a clinical trial. 
Dr Robert Chiesa, from the bone-marrow transplant department at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: ""It is extremely exciting. Obviously, this is a new field in medicine and it's fascinating that we can redirect the immune system to fight cancer.""
gy, though, only scratches the surface of what base editing could achieve.
Dr David Liu, one of the inventors of base editing at the Broad Institute, told me it was ""a bit surreal"" that people were being treated just six years after the technology was invented. 
In Alyssa's therapy, each of the base edits involved breaking a section of genetic code so it no longer worked. But there are more nuanced applications where instead of switching an instruction off you can fix a defective one. Sickle-cell anaemia, for example, is caused by just one base change that could be corrected.
So there are already trials of base editing under way in sickle-cell disease, as well as high cholesterol that runs in families and the blood disorder beta-thalassemia.
Dr Liu said the ""therapeutic applications of base editing are just beginning"" and it was ""humbling to be part of this era of therapeutic human gene editing"", as science was now taking ""key steps towards taking control of our genomes"".

technology	Instagram debuts new age-verification tools in UK and EU	"Instagram has introduced technology to help verify the age of users in the UK and EU.
Anyone trying to edit their date of birth from that of an under-18 to that of an over-18 must verify their age.
But now, users have the option to record a video of themselves that will be analysed by age-estimation technology, instead of uploading ID.
Instagram said this would help ensure users' experiences on the platform were age appropriate.
In June, Instagram announced it was exploring ways for teenagers to verify their age and comply with platform rules.
And in a US trial, they were given three ways to verify they were over 18: 
Instagram says it already uses artificial intelligence and in-app reports to help determine whether users are under 18 and, indeed, under 13, its minimum age.
But according to research commissioned by UK media regulator Ofcom, one in three children lies about their age to access adult content on social media.
Instagram accounts for under-18s:
Instagram public policy director Tara Hopkins said video age verification was an ""important step"" in delivering safer and better experiences for teenagers on the platform. 
""We want everyone to experience Instagram in a way that's appropriate for their age, which means we need to know how old they are - and this is a challenge across our industry,"" she said.
Instagram already uses video selfies to verify the identity of users locked out of their account
It has now extended its partnership with UK digital identity provider Yoti to use them to verify age. 
Yoti's technology estimates age by analysing facial features.
On average, it says, it is accurate to within:
Meta, which owns Instagram, says the technology cannot identify anything about users except their age and it and Yoti will delete images once this has been done.
Platforms could face further requirements for verifying the age of younger users under government proposals for the Online Safety Bill, which ministers have said will return to Parliament as soon as possible. "	/news/technology-63544332
politics	Rishi Sunak: Golden era of UK-China relations is over	"Rishi Sunak has said the so-called ""golden era"" of relations with China is over, as he vowed to ""evolve"" the UK's stance towards the country.
In his first foreign policy speech, Mr Sunak said the closer economic ties of the previous decade had been ""naïve"".
rime minister said the UK had to replace wishful thinking with ""robust pragmatism"" towards competitors.
But he warned against ""Cold War rhetoric"", adding that China's global significance could not be ignored.
Mr Sunak has faced pressure from Tory backbenchers to toughen the UK's stance on China since he took over as prime minister last month. 
His speech, at the Lord Mayor's Banquet in London, comes after protests in China over the weekend against the country's strict Covid lockdown laws.
Police have made several arrests, and a BBC journalist was detained while covering a protest in Shanghai on Sunday. He was beaten and kicked by the police during his arrest and held for several hours before being released.
Mr Sunak told the audience of business leaders and foreign policy experts that, in the face of the protests, China had ""chosen to crack down further, including by assaulting a BBC journalist"".
""We recognise China poses a systemic challenge to our values and interests, a challenge that grows more acute as it moves towards even greater authoritarianism,"" he said.
Watch: BBC journalist Ed Lawrence arrested covering China Covid protests
He added that the ""golden era"" of UK-China relations was ""over"", along with the ""naïve idea"" that more trade with the West would lead to Chinese political reform.
rase ""golden era"" is associated with closer economic ties under former Prime Minister David Cameron - but relations between London and Beijing have since deteriorated.
However, Mr Sunak stressed that ""we cannot simply ignore China's significance in world affairs - to global economic stability or issues like climate change"".
He added that the UK would work with allies including the US, Canada, Australia, and Japan to ""manage this sharpening competition, including with diplomacy and engagement"".
""It means standing up to our competitors, not with grand rhetoric but with robust pragmatism,"" he added. 
Mr Sunak and Chinese President Xi Jinping were set to meet for the first time at the G20 summit in Indonesia earlier this month, but the encounter was cancelled following a missile blast in Poland.
Mr Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss was reportedly planning to re-categorise China as a ""threat"" to the UK as part of a review of its foreign policy.
In his speech, Mr Sunak echoed the phrase used in the review - that China is a ""systemic challenge"". He said there would be more details of the review in the new year. 
ruth is, right now, we don't know in practical terms what this new approach will actually amount to.
Mr Sunak is promising more detail in what is known as the Integrated Review - which will set out the UK's national security and foreign policy - in the new year.
But we know already how China is now described: a ""systemic challenge"".
government hopes that people will understand that international relations, like any human relations, are complex and nuanced; that a binary approach, as they see it, would not be in the UK's interests.
But for the prime minister's critics, failing to describe Beijing as a ""threat"" is a big mistake.
But the ""robust pragmatism"" line in the speech was criticised by former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith - one of a number of backbenchers pushing for a tougher line.
During an urgent question in the Commons on the safety of British journalists in China, he asked the Foreign Office minister to explain ""how 'robustly pragmatic' will worry the Chinese any one bit?""
Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy called the speech ""thin as gruel"", accusing the government of ""flip-flopping its rhetoric on China"".
Nigel Inkster, senior China advisor at foreign affairs think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he did not think the China-UK golden age ""was ever real and substantial"". 
He said: ""It attempted to focus on economic relations with China while putting geopolitics to one side, and experience shows you simply can't do that.""
Renewed debate about the UK's relationship with China comes as members of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee have travelled to Taiwan - which Beijing claims as it territory - to meet its president. 
mmittee is holding an inquiry into UK foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific region and how it can maximise its influence there. 
Elsewhere in his speech, Mr Sunak promised to continue support for Ukraine, adding: ""We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.""
He promised to ""maintain or increase"" British military aid to the country next year, and provide new air support to protect civilians and critical infrastructure.
Mr Sunak visited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this month, in his first visit to Kyiv since entering Downing Street.
During the visit, he announced the UK would supply Ukraine with additional anti-aircraft guns and radars, and increase the training offer to Ukraine's armed forces. 
President Zelensky's wife, Olena Zelenska, made her own visit to London on Monday where she spoke about sexual violence allegedly being perpetrated by Russian troops in Ukraine."	/news/uk-politics-63787877
politics	Micheál Martin wishes UK well amid 'time of uncertainty'	"(Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin has wished the UK government ""well in the challenging times ahead"".
He said the UK was in a ""time of political change and some uncertainty"" as it prepared to appoint a new prime minister - its third within two months.
On Monday, it was confirmed Rishi Sunak would succeed Liz Truss in Number 10.
""A stable and prosperous Britain is in all our interests,"" Mr Martin said.
He was addressing UK and Irish politicians at a meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the new prime minister will face a challenge of ensuring Northern Ireland ""does not remain endlessly in limbo"" without government.
Speaking in Belfast, she accused the DUP of ""inertia and inaction, and do-nothing politics"".
Ms McDonald said Downing Street should quickly demonstrate a willingness to get Stormont restored. 
""There certainly can't be any further delay,"" Ms McDonald said.
""We need to see an end to the brinkmanship, to the bad faith and we need to see now a good faith engagement and the making of a deal, which by the way and we have said this repeatedly, can be done very, very quickly.""
In Mr Martin's speech on Monday morning, he called for better cooperation between the UK and Irish governments on the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
rotocol - the post-Brexit trade arrangement for Northern Ireland - has been a source of tension since it came into force at the start of 2021.
ks between the UK and the EU have resumed in an attempt to resolve the issue but there is no sign of an imminent deal.
""To the incoming British prime minister I want to stress the importance of the two governments working in partnership to support the gains of the Good Friday Agreement,"" said the taoiseach.
""I urge the new British prime minister to move quickly to genuine and substantive engagement with European Union.""
British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly - made up of politicians from both jurisdictions - meets twice a year, with this event focussing on trade and the economic effect of Brexit.
g the event also heard from Northern Ireland Office Minister Steve Baker.
He said that regardless of who became the UK's new prime minister, the government would stick to its existing policy on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
government at Stormont has not functioned fully since February when the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew from the executive in protest at the protocol.
DUP believes the protocol undermines Northern Ireland's place within the UK by effectively creating a trade border in the Irish Sea."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63365648
entertainment	TV lookahead: 23 highlights to look out for in 2023	"Events that brought the nation together in 2022 ranged from the funeral of Her Majesty the Queen to the Lionesses' Euro football victory.
unify millions of viewers in front of their TV screens.
2023 won't have some of the big dramas many may have hoped for. (We don't know if, let alone when, there might be more Bodyguard or Line of Duty coming our way).
But the year ahead still offers some tantalising titles and events.
So here (in strictly alphabetical order) are some of the TV programmes and events that could get us all talking in 2023.
An eight-part musical drama described as a love letter to Black British music and set in south London. It brings audiences into the heart of an intense music battle between a rapping brother and sister. It's written by award-winning author Candice Carty-Williams (whose debut novel Queenie won book of the year at the British Book Awards). The series stars Malcolm Kamulete, Déja J. Bowens, Ray BLK, Nadine Marshall, Ray Fearon and Jo Martin.

While it might seem somewhat out of place on a list like this, the King's coronation is certain to be one of the TV events of the year. Multiple channels are likely to be showing the historic ceremony at Westminster Abbey, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The extraordinary length of the Queen's reign means that this will only be the second coronation ever to be televised. Her Majesty the Queen's coronation in 1953 triggered a huge increase in the purchase of TV sets which were then still an expensive novelty. And when we talk about televised events that bring the nation together, it's easy to forget that the last coronation was the first time that ever happened.

After series five of The Crown triggered widespread discussions about the blurred lines between historical fact and imagined drama, the sixth and final series of the royal drama sees Imelda Staunton returning as the Queen and Jonathan Pryce as the Duke of Edinburgh. It's expected to cover seismic events like the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in a Paris car crash, and the effect its aftermath had on the monarchy and the public.

It's the time travel drama's 60th anniversary year. And we'll be getting not just one, but two new Doctors. Sort of. The first will be David Tennant, returning as the 14th Doctor for a series of three specials which will air in November. Then over the Christmas period, Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa will take over from Tennant as the 15th Doctor with Millie Gibson as his companion. With show runner Russell T. Davies (who oversaw the original David Tennant era) back in charge, not to mention an actor like Gatwa who is already hugely popular with younger viewers, there's a high degree of expectation that the show will see a significant boost in its popularity.

m Hiddleston's Loki has always been a fan favourite. The first series of the show saw an alternative version of Loki (the events of the Avengers movies Infinity War and Endgame created something of a cosmic kerfuffle) being brought to a body called The Time Variance Authority, which exists to keep the universe and its timelines on track. The second series picks up in the aftermath of the first season's spectacular finale. As with much of the interconnected Marvel universe, the events of the series are likely to have repercussions for the storylines of other Marvel projects.

2022 was the year we lost Neighbours forever. Until it then unexpectedly became the year that Neighbours was saved - a twist worthy of the Australian soap itself. Channel Five, which was responsible for a huge amount of the soap's budget, decided to pull the plug. Another broadcaster couldn't be found, and the residents of Ramsay Street said goodbye in a finale packed with returning stars including Guy Pearce, Jason Donovan and Kylie Minogue.

rama Squid Game, where contestants competed in deadly games until only one survived was one of the most talked about shows of 2021. This companion real-life contest presumably won't be quite as dramatic. Here, 16 people are dropped in a paradise location. Half of them have keys to a dream villa, the other half must live and survive in the jungle. The winner of a daily challenge will be allowed into the villa, but at the same time one of the existing residents must be ejected, and it's only those inside the villa who have a shot at winning a huge cash prize. Not quite Red Light, Green Light it must be said, but could still be compelling, (and rather safer) TV.

Care Quality Commission (CQC) carried out a surprise inspection at the city's County Hospital in October and found a number of issues.
rust was issued with a warning notice in 2019 and retains a CQC rating of requiring improvement. 
Wye Valley Trust has said it is, ""addressing the issues that need to be tackled"".
Issues inspectors found included:
However, employees demonstrated good knowledge of safeguarding principles and the hospital's team knew how to identify adults and children at risk of significant harm.
CQC found surgical services had improved from inadequate to requires improvement for being safe and well-led. 
""On our return to The County Hospital, we found insufficient improvements had been made and people were still at risk from poor care, said Amanda Lyndon, CQC head of inspection.
""The biggest issue we found was that assessments weren't being carried out effectively and this was putting people's safety at risk.""
Jane Ives, Wye Valley Trust managing director, said: ""We look forward to welcoming back the inspectors in the future to capture our further improvement work.""

technology	Meta's chatbot says the company 'exploits people'	"Meta's new prototype chatbot has told the BBC that Mark Zuckerberg exploits its users for money. 
Meta says the chatbot uses artificial intelligence and can chat on ""nearly any topic"". 
Asked what the chatbot thought of the company's CEO and founder, it replied ""our country is divided and he didn't help that at all"". 
Meta said the chatbot was a prototype and might produce rude or offensive answers. 
""Everyone who uses Blender Bot is required to acknowledge they understand it's for research and entertainment purposes only, that it can make untrue or offensive statements, and that they agree to not intentionally trigger the bot to make offensive statements,"" said a Meta spokesperson.
, called BlenderBot 3, was released to the public on Friday.
rogramme ""learns"" from large amounts of publicly available language data. 
When asked about Mark Zuckerberg, the chatbot told the BBC: ""He did a terrible job at testifying before congress. It makes me concerned about our country."" 
Mr Zuckerberg has been questioned several times by US politicians, most notably in 2018. 
""Our country is divided, and he didn't help with that at all,"" the chatbot continued.
""His company exploits people for money and he doesn't care. It needs to stop!"" it said.
Meta has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent disinformation and hate speech being spread on its platforms. Last year a former employee, Frances Haugen, accused the company of putting profits ahead of online safety. 
mpany owns some of the largest social media companies and messaging apps in the world, including Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. 
BlenderBot 3's algorithm searches the internet to inform its answers. It is likely its views on Mr Zuckerberg have been ""learnt' from other people's opinions that the algorithm has analysed. 
Wall Street Journal has reported BlenderBot 3 told one of its journalists that Donald Trump was, and will always be, the US president. 
A business Insider journalist said the chatbot called Mr Zuckerberg ""creepy"". 
Meta has made the BlenderBot 3 public, and risked bad publicity, for a reason. It needs data. 
""Allowing an AI system to interact with people in the real world leads to longer, more diverse conversations, as well as more varied feedback,"" Meta said in a blog post. 
Chatbots that learn from interactions with people can learn from their good and bad behaviour.
In 2016 Microsoft apologised after Twitter users taught its chatbot to be racist.
Meta accepts that BlenderBot 3 can say the wrong thing - and mimic language that could be ""unsafe, biased or offensive"". The company said it had installed safeguards, however, the chatbot could still be rude.
When I asked the BlenderBot 3 what it thought about me, it said it had never heard of me. 
""He must not be that popular,"" it said.

entertainment	Lizzo plays 200-year-old flute owned by former US president	"US star Lizzo wowed fans during a concert on Tuesday in Washington DC when she took to the stage to play a 200-year-old crystal flute, once owned by former US President James Madison.
ger and trained flautist was granted permission by The Library of Congress to play the instrument, which arrived on stage with a police escort.
Inspecting it on stage, she said: ""It's like playing out of a wine glass.""
She then played a few notes while simultaneously shaking her lower body.
""I just twerked and played James Madison's flute from the 1800s!"" she beamed, after having handed it back to a representative who put it back in its case.
While posting the video on her own social media channels afterwards, the Houston-raised Juice singer told her fans: ""No one has ever heard what is sounds like... now you do.""
She later added: ""As a flute player this is iconic and I will never be over it."" 
A spokesperson for the Library of Congress told the BBC that the flute may have been played in public on a rare special occasion in the past, most likely in Madison's time.
Until Lizzo picked up the flute, the Library's curator, who has worked at the Library since 1993, had never heard it played live.
Following her historic gig on Tuesday evening, The Library of Congress tweeted to confirm the flute had been returned safely.
""We just did a DNA test,"" they posted. ""Turns out: It's 100% that [crystal] flute"" - a play on words with the lyrics from Lizzo's hit song Truth Hurts.
Grammy-winner Lizzo is currently touring the US in support of her fourth album, Special, which featured the TikTok hit, About Damn Time.
Earlier this summer, she changed the lyrics to a new song, Grrrls, after fans complained it used an ableist slur.
James Madison, America's fourth President from 1809 to 1817, made a major contribution to the ratification of the Constitution by writing The Federalist Papers, along with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay.

entertainment	The Good Nurse: 'I risked everything to make sure he was behind bars'	"You have a couple of hours to kill. A friend suggests you catch a new Hollywood film about one of America's most prolific serial killers, starring two A-list actors. Another procedural thriller to while away a dark autumn evening? Go on then.
But while Tobias Lindholm's The Good Nurse is definitely not short on psychological tension, this isn't your typical sensationalist murder mystery fare.
Based on the book of the same name by journalist Charles Graeber, the film's narrative focuses on the true story of how nurse Amy Loughren helped put a stop to the heinous actions of fellow medic and friend Charles Cullen, who killed dozens of patients in his care over more than a decade while working at several US hospitals.
Loughren and Cullen are played by Oscar winners Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne. While Redmayne delivers a menacing and nuanced turn as the disturbing killer, the film's cornerstone is the heroism displayed by Chastain's character, a single mother suffering from a life-threatening heart condition while working in a physically and mentally demanding job, albeit one she loves.
Chastain says that angle was what attracted her to the film: ""Normally we fetishise violence and murder and we [have a] need to really explore the individual who was responsible for it. But what if we explore the individual who stops it? I find that so healing, and it is a radical act of filmmaking.""
She adds: ""I've lost someone very close to me. And when you've lost someone… how could another person do a story and entertain on [the topic of] death?""
Loughren formed a close bond with Cullen while they worked night shifts together at Somerset Medical Centre in New Jersey in the early 2000s. He helped her with childcare, and covered for her when she suffered severe breathlessness due to her heart condition. He was her confidante. 
After several suspicious deaths at the hospital led to an investigation, police asked Loughren to assist them. She provided them with evidence and ended up playing a crucial role in extracting Cullen's confession. However, accepting a close friend could have committed such terrible crimes took its toll.
Loughren, who is now doing well following experimental heart surgery 18 years ago, says: ""I struggled with the guilt of missing him [Cullen]. I struggled with the guilt of not seeing that that friendship also had a monstrous dark side. 
""And I didn't want to see it. I wanted to believe that he was a mercy killer so that I could still care about him. And he wasn't a mercy killer. He was a cold-blooded murderer. And for me to not have seen that, I really did struggle.""
She is kinder to herself now. 
""I literally risked everything to make sure he was behind bars. And I was showing up every single day and pushing myself every single day no matter how sick I was. I still showed up to be a mom. I still showed up to be a good nurse and watching her [Jessica], I could be proud of that character. It opened up a space for me to say: 'I did good'.""
Reviews of the film have been largely positive. The Times critic Kevin Maher gave it four stars, declaring: ""Eddie Redmayne shines in this Trojan horse thriller that describes the crimes of a psychopathic hospital predator but is really about the iniquities of the US healthcare system.
Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore described it as ""a gripping but refreshingly un-manipulative true-crime tragedy"".
re were a couple of naysayers, however. Screen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki described it as a ""run-of-the-mill crime drama that doesn't stand out"", while The Slant's Mark Hanson only gave it two stars, writing: ""[By the end] Redmayne is raging with such histrionic flair that the film suddenly feels as if it's completely removed from any semblance to reality.""
Danish filmmaker Lindholm, who wrote the TV series Borgen and films such as Another Round, says he almost didn't believe Loughren's story when he first read Krysty Wilson-Cairns's screenplay a few years ago. He decided he had to meet the nurse himself to establish if it was really true.
""I met her in New York... and everything was confirmed. On top of that, she was more brilliant than I thought, more human. Her [heart] disease had been much worse [than I thought]."" 
Lindholm was used to ""making films with my nine best friends"" in Copenhagen. He had never made a Hollywood studio film before and didn't think he ever would. He had also never made a film in the English language. But meeting Loughran changed his mind.
""Right there, I decided I will do an American film and try to get this to work... to make a story about humanity, about the strength of one individual in this whole system that didn't work.""
m he refers to is the one that allowed Cullen to move from hospital to hospital, giving him the opportunity to commit more murders.
He was fired from five nursing jobs and resigned from two others because of concerns over his practices.
But over a 16-year career he always found re-employment. It is thought this is partly because hospitals did not share their suspicions about him for fear of being sued.
In the film, the Somerset Medical Centre legal team and risk officer (played by Kim Dickens) try to keep the police at arm's length by insisting they are carrying out a seemingly never-ending internal investigation into any possible wrongdoing.
""As a consequence of Charles Cullen's case, whenever someone is reported, their records now have to be kept for seven years. The fact that that wasn't already happening… it's astonishing,"" Redmayne says, clearly incredulous.
""The fact he was allowed access to these vulnerable people, it's pretty dumbfounding.""
US healthcare system comes under scrutiny again in the film when it starkly highlights the struggle for some people in the US to access affordable healthcare. 
Loughren was too ill to work but was not able to qualify for health insurance until she had worked at the hospital for one year. So she had to keep working against medical advice.
In one scene, she is seen scrabbling around for enough money to pay nearly $1,000 (£900) for a heart check-up, eventually spreading it over two credit cards.
While the NHS is under pressure with long waiting lists for routine appointments, pressures on A&E and the ambulance service, and staff shortages, Redmayne suggests we should appreciate what it still offers.
""It made me incredibly grateful [for the NHS],"" Redmayne says. ""It feels like this film should be seen by British viewers as a warning in some ways. I think it's really important because we take it so for granted. That moment when you see Amy putting it [the medical bill] on two credit cards, I hope it's an eye opener for the British audience.""
final word on the film's intended legacy should perhaps go to Loughren, who is now a complementary medicine practitioner. 
""This platform that I have in this moment is really about giving a voice to the victims… because everyone was saying [Cullen] was a mercy killer and they were going to die anyway. No, they weren't. Many of his victims were very young. Many of his victims were about ready to leave the hospital and he stole that from them. And their families deserve that voice.""
Good Nurse will be in selected UK cinemas from 19 October and can be seen on Netflix from 26 October. A documentary based on the story, titled Capturing The Killer Nurse, will also be available on Netflix from 11 November."	/news/entertainment-arts-63207881

sports	CrossFit Games: Northern Ireland girl dubbed world's fittest teen after win	"A 15-year-old girl from Newtownards has been dubbed the world's fittest teenager after taking gold at the World CrossFit Games. 
Lucy McConigle secured the win for her age group at the event in Madison, Wisconsin last weekend.
She then went on to win two bronze medals at the European Youth Weightlifting Championships in Poland this week.
Her training regime covers a broad range of high-intensity disciplines.
CrossFit Games is an annual competition in which athletes are scored across a number of demanding exercises, such as weightlifting, burpees and pull-ups.
xercise regime was created by American Greg Glassman and there more than 15,000 CrossFit-affiliated gyms across 160 countries.
who win at the CrossFit Games are given the label of world's fittest, with Lucy the latest to join those ranks. 
Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster, Lucy explained the variety of training required.
""CrossFit is basically every sport mushed into one. There's gymnastics, running, biking... a whole load of high intensity interval-style training is what I do.
""I also do running, swimming, paddle boarding, weightlifting - (they) would be the main elements,"" she added.
was Lucy's first time winning gold at the competition, having been awarded a silver medal last year.
""I'm proud after I know all the effort that's gone into it. I feel like it's good to finally compete and get the title I thought I deserved,"" she said.
Lucy developed an interest in CrossFit from a young age, having previously been a keen swimmer, and is currently supported by her coach, Sam Duckett.
""From ten-years-old I recognised how good she was... probably from when Lucy was thirteen-and-a-half she also recognised how good she was, she won't admit it,"" he said.
Mr Duckett praised Lucy's talent in taking his feedback and being able to ""pick up things straight away"" as well as her willingness to push through a ""deep, dark cave"" of pain.
""Being very adaptable is key, the ability to learn really quickly - that's massive because there's so many disciplines and elements to it.
""It's the ability to work on your own for three, four hours a day and to be able to suffer pain more than the next person beside you who is also trying to be the fittest person in the world,"" he said.
""I think because I started when I was so young, it's always been that way, I haven't really had a chance to question it or think twice about it, I think it just comes naturally [dealing with pain],"" Lucy added. 
Having secured two medals at this year's European Youth Weightlifting Championships, in which she deadlifted 148kg, Mr Duckett is anticipating further success for Lucy.
""She's on that pathway with the Great British weightlifting team, towards competing in the Olympics someday. Our aim is to get her to compete as an individual."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-62589123
health	Diphtheria: Migrants with symptoms to be isolated	"Migrants with symptoms of diphtheria are to be put into isolation, as cases of the disease rise, ministers say.
wing signs of infection will be separated for a ""short period"" at the Manston processing centre in Kent, or at a ""designated isolation centre"" while they are treated.
follows the death of a man at Manston, which may have been caused by diphtheria. 
Health secretary Steve Barclay said the risk to the public was ""very low"". 
During a visit to the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, Mr Barclay said a ""very high uptake"" of diphtheria vaccinations within the British public meant many people were well protected. 
He stressed that the situation was being monitored ""closely"".
Diphtheria is a highly contagious infection that affects the nose, throat and sometimes cause ulcers on the skin.
According to the NHS website, it is spread by coughs and sneezes or through close contact with someone who is infected, and in serious cases can be fatal.
It can also be spread by sharing items such as cups, cutlery, clothing or bedding with an infected person. 
UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there had been an ""increase"" in cases of diphtheria reported among migrants arriving in the UK.
It has confirmed 50 cases were identified as of 25 November, including among children. The figure stood at 39 on November 10.
Public health experts have raised concerns about the spread of the disease as migrants were moved to hotels.
UKHSA report said 38 of the cases have been reported in south-east England, with some cases also detected across London, the West Midlands and the north-east of England.
re offered to people on arrival at their new accommodation.
Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said any asylum seekers who may have the infection but are already in hotels will be told to isolate in their rooms while they are treated. 
He later confirmed the isolation centres would be similar to those used to curb infections during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Mr Jenrick told the Commons: ""From today, no-one presenting with symptoms will progress into the asylum accommodation system.
""They will either remain at Manston, isolating for a short period, or they will travel to a designated isolation centre in secure transport where they will be treated until deemed medically fit.""
reatment of migrants at the processing centre in Kent has triggered a wave of campaigns and concern from health professionals and campaigners. 
At one point, the facility designed to hold 1,600 people contained 4,000. 
Charity Detention Action launched a legal campaign to remove migrants housed in the facility for longer than 24 hours.  
Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the overcrowding was caused by a lack of suitable accommodation.
She told MPs: ""What I have refused to do is to prematurely release thousands of people into local communities without having anywhere for them to stay.""
A post-mortem examination is being carried out to determine the cause of death of the man who died after being held at Manston.  A test indicated ""diphtheria may be the cause"" of his illness, government officials have said."	/news/uk-63788016
entertainment	Cardiff Castle animal wall comes alive in children's book	"What would the stone animals perched on Cardiff Castle's wall get up to if they could come alive and enjoy the city at night? 
Illustrator Jack Skivens' first children's book sees the creatures visiting some of the city's best-known landmarks before returning to their positions before sunrise. 
In Night of the Animal Wall, the vulture sits on the old Brains brewery tower waiting for passers-by to drops chips on Caroline Street, fondly known as Chippy Alley. 
r and bear stop for a game of chess at the city's pedestrianised shopping area, The Hayes.
Alexandra Gardens while the leopard spends the evening racing trains at Central Station. 
Jack, 35, said the book was inspired by both his own childhood memories of visiting the 130-year-old statues and the questions of his curious four-year-old twins.
""It was always really special and really big and exciting to go to Cardiff,"" said Jack, who grew up in nearby Caerphilly and now lives a few miles away in Pontypridd.  
""The animals on the wall always took my interest, there was always this eeriness about them - it's just such a strange collection of animals.""
He found himself wondering if the animals could be more than mere statues. 
""I had ideas when I was younger about them coming to life, I had a really active imagination,"" he said. 
""It was kind of a nice place for your mind to wander off to, thinking about those animals wandering around and kind of what they would do.""
During the Covid pandemic lockdowns he began illustrating the stone animals.
""The idea was nature was thriving in our absence without cars and what-have-you and were able to explore new territory,"" he said.  
He also spent time during lockdowns out exploring with his children. 
""It was looking at them and the way that they see things and imagine that pushed me again to [write the book],"" he said.
k will be released on 29 October, and a city-wide animal art trail based on his story is planned for the October half-term.
Funded by the City Ambition Fund, the free event will see families invited to go on an adventure across Cardiff to find the animals who have escaped from the pages of Jack's tale.
Jack will also be hosting a series of children's book readings. 
He said he had enjoyed showing his own children the landmarks depicted in his book.
""They're really excited for it, there's that experience of taking them to these places and they're actually real, watching their minds and seeing the questions they have afterwards has been really, really fun,"" he said. 
Cardiff Castle's animal wall has been delighting adults and children alike since it was installed in 1890.
mas Nicholls began carving the animals in the late 1880s, based on sketches by architect William Burges, who was employed by the 3rd Marquess of Bute.
re were originally eight animals on the wall - a pair of lions holding shields, a lioness, a polar bear, a sea lion, a wolf, an ape and a hyena, and it was situated directly in front of the castle.
In the 1920s the wall was moved to its present position west of the castle after road widening on Castle Street, and a further seven animals by sculptor Alexander Carrick were added  - the lynx, vulture, beaver, leopard, raccoon, pelican and anteater. The polar bear was also replaced by a bear.
Night of the Animal Wall art and sculpture trail will run in Cardiff from 29 October until 4 November as part of FOR Cardiff's City of Arcades week. "	/news/uk-wales-63231357
business	Bounty bars removed from Celebrations tubs in trial	"Bounty hunters may have their work cut out this Christmas, after chocolate manufacturer Mars Wrigley said it would be eliminating the sweet from some of its tubs.
ut-flavoured treat may be marketed as a slice of paradise, but nearly 40% of us hate them, Mars says.
So a limited run of ""No Bounty"" tubs will go on sale at 40 Tesco stores in the run-up to Christmas.
It comes after the brand let shoppers return unwanted Bounties last year. 
However, the food maker said it was yet to decide whether the treats would be banished for good. Because while a survey for the firm found many people leave the coconut creation languishing at the bottom of the tub, for 18% it is still their choc of choice.
Big tubs of Quality Street, Roses, Celebrations and Heroes start appearing on supermarket shelves in the run-up to Christmas, with sales usually soaring during the festive season.
But cost-of-living concerns could see customers striking some treats off their shopping lists. Stirring the debate around customers' preferences is one way to promote the brand, with one communications company describing lively discussion about the move on social media as a ""great PR coup for the Mars team"".
Mars Wrigley said its survey, which consulted 2,000 people aged between 18 and 65, suggested that 18% would feel irritated to find only Bounty bars were left in a tub, while 58% believed it would lead to a family argument.
Its polling also suggests the sweet is popular with older consumers, with 38% of over-55s choosing it as their preferred bar.
Mars Wrigley said the limited edition tubs would include additional Mars, Snickers, Milky Way, Galaxy and Maltesers sweets in place of the missing Bounty. They will be available at ""pop ups"" within 40 different Tesco stores for six weeks in the run-up to Christmas.
It follows a ""Bounty Return Scheme"" last year, in which Bounty haters were able to return their unwanted chocolates and swap them for Maltesers after the festive period.
""Last year, we gave customers the opportunity to return their unwanted Bounty chocolates. Now, off the back of public demand, we're trialling taking them out of the tub altogether,"" said Celebrations senior brand manager Emily Owen."	/news/business-63497187
health	No ambulance to meet helicopter patient at hospital	"A patient was airlifted to Glasgow Airport as no ambulances were available for a 300 yard transfer from the helipad at an East Ayrshire hospital.
ual, who was picked up by an air ambulance on Arran, was then driven 26 miles from the airport back to Crosshouse Hospital, near Kilmarnock.
Both the Scottish Ambulance Service and Scottish government have apologised for the delay.
A Tory MSP said the patient's experience was ""truly terrifying"".
Details of the case, first reported by LBC, emerged amid mounting winter pressures on the NHS.
resulted in an appeal by NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde for patients only to turn up at A&E if their situation is urgent or life-threatening.
And on Wednesday NHS Lothian confirmed relatives of some hospital patients are to be asked to provide care for their loved ones at home in a bid to free up beds.
In the latest example of the strain on the system it has emerged a patient was airlifted to Crosshouse earlier this month having taken unwell on the Isle of Arran.
But after the helicopter landed it became clear there were no ambulances available to complete the short journey from the helipad to the hospital.
Instead they were flown about 25 miles to Glasgow Airport where they they met an ambulance crew who drove them back to Kilmarnock. 
A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said: ""Whilst we are limited in what we can say due to patient confidentiality, we can confirm we transported a patient from Arran to Crosshouse Hospital via air ambulance on Thursday 8 December 2022. 
""Unfortunately, extended hospital turnaround times at Crosshouse Hospital at that time meant a delay to the ambulance and therefore the aircraft had to divert to Glasgow Airport to avoid icing in the bad weather. 
""We apologise for any distress caused.""
A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of this incident and understand that the ambulance service are looking into the circumstances. 
""We expect steps to be taken to ensure incidents of this kind do not occur again, and we apologise to this patient for their experience and hope they are recovering well.""
Claire Burden, chief executive of NHS Ayrshire & Arran, said its hospitals were experiencing ""extremely high demand"" for unscheduled care services.
She apologised for the longer waiting times experienced by some patients, and said they were working with the Scottish Ambulance Service to reduce avoidable waits. 
Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said the story was a damning indictment of the current state of the health service.
He added: ""This will have been a truly terrifying situation for this patient and my thoughts are with them. 
""It lays bare the total chaos that Humza Yousaf is presiding over in our NHS, despite the best efforts of dedicated ambulance crews.
""Going back and forth between different health boards, having already been in an air ambulance, will have caused huge distress and anxiety for this suffering patient.""
Dr Gulhane also called for the patient to be given an ""urgent apology"" after a chain of events he described as ""utterly shameful"".
Meanwhile, on Tuesday it emerged more than a third of people attending at A&E departments were not seen within the Scottish government's four-hour target in the first full week of December.
Data from Public Health Scotland (PHS) showed that in the week to 11 December, 62.4% of people were seen and subsequently admitted, transferred or discharged within the target time.
Scottish government aims to have 95% of people seen within the four-hour target.
But last month the country's hospitals recorded their worst ever accident and emergency waiting times.
In a separate development, NHS Lothian bosses are urging anyone asked to provide care for a relative on an interim basis while waiting for a package of social care to be put in place to ""give the request some serious consideration"".
rd's chief executive Calum Campbell said the move comes as the health service comes under ""unprecedented"" and ""sustained"" pressure.
It comes at a time when the NHS is dealing with large numbers of emergency patients, at the same time as medics are seeing an increase in respiratory illness.
Delayed discharge, where patients are medically well enough to leave hospital but have to stay while they wait for care arrangements to be put in place, is also increasing pressure on the service, the health board said."	/news/uk-scotland-64052318
sports	Rebeca Shorten: Belfast woman helps Great Britain win fours world title	"Belfast rower Rebecca Shorten helped Great Britain win World Championship fours gold as Ireland's Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy retained their lightweight men double sculls title.
Shorten clinched her first world title as the dominant British finished 2.23 seconds ahead of the Netherlands.
GB quartet of Shorten, Heidi Long, Samantha Redgrave and Rowan McKellar took control of the race after halfway.
""We knew everyone was going to bring their game today,"" said Shorten, 28.
""We got off to a good start, our speed was good, and I think we knew we were going to have to work hard in the second half because everyone was going to be with us but we held our cool and we did that really well,"" added Shorten.
""We didn't lose our heads in the middle of the race, and we just kept going.""
With the Netherlands taking silver, the medal places were completed by Olympic champions Australia.
world gold completed a superb first season for the four GB rowers who remained unbeaten throughout and had won the European title last month and they have set down a marker to the rest of the world with less than two years to the Paris Olympics.
Despite trailing to the fast-starting Australians and with the Dutch and China in contention the GB boat, stroked by Shorten, moved to the front by the halfway mark and gradually, but with confidence, rowed away to a winning margin of just over a boat length.
""Each race we knew we had to improve to stay on top of the field. This has been a long year, long season, and next year with the Olympic qualification it will be another huge one. But right now, I am a bit speechless,"" added Shorten.
Irish four, bronze medallists from the Olympics last year, finished in sixth and last place, with the crew of Aifric Keogh, Elmer Lambe, Fiona Murtagh and Emily Hegarty, never in the hunt for the medals.
rest of the world tried to take the race to the Olympic and World champions Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy in the men's lightweight double sculls final.
Irish duo were last at the 500m mark but by halfway had moved through the field to first.
O'Donovan and McCarthy then raised the rate again to move a length clear as they dominated the closing stages to win by clear water from Italy and Ukraine.
It's a third world title for O'Donovan in the lightweight double sculls to go with two more in the lightweight singles sculls.
re was also a bronze medal for Ireland in the lightweight women's double sculls as Aoife Casey and Margaret Cremen held off France to finish third behind the world champions from Great Britain's Emily Craig and Imogen Grant. 
Ireland men's four were involved in a thrilling 'B' final with half a second separating the top three. Germany squeezed home in first place ahead of Ireland with Poland in third.
Irish quartet includes Nathan Timoney from Enniskillen and Kinawley's Ross Corrigan, both students at Queen's University, and along with Jack Dorney and John Kearney were making their senior international debuts this week.

sports	Lewis Hamilton: Why Red Bull breaching salary cap is another 'kick' on 2021 loss	"Lewis Hamilton thought he'd buried the ghosts of Abu Dhabi, but they all came rushing back with the revelation that Red Bull broke Formula 1's budget cap last season.
Losing a record eighth world title after an official freestyled with the rules was ""definitely spirit-breaking, or soul-crushing, whatever you want to call it,"" Hamilton says, recalling that controversial evening at Yas Marina last December. 
So when Hamilton discovered his rivals from 2021, against whom he fought one of the bitterest title battles in F1 history, had exceeded the sport's brand-new spending limit during that season ""that, for sure, brings up a little bit of emotion,"" he admits. 
""Because you kind of buried it and moved on,"" the Mercedes driver adds, ""and then it comes back up and it's like another bit of a kick. And, yeah, that just bought it all kind of fresh again. So then [it was a case of] just getting back into the phase of just suppressing it and moving forwards.""
Hamilton is talking to BBC Sport in a small group interview at the United States Grand Prix. And he is in expansive mood, discussing a range of topics, including Mercedes' difficult year and his future.
Hamilton has tended to brush off questions about Abu Dhabi and its aftermath this season, preferring to not distract his focus from the immediate task at hand.
But here he is willing to dredge it up again - it is, after all, the context for the most difficult season Hamilton has had in 10 years, in an uncompetitive Mercedes car that he admitted on Sunday looks set to leave him without a win in a season for the first time in his career.
Going into the final laps at Yas Marina last December, Hamilton felt he was just about to complete a remarkable comeback. 
After a long, bruising season, dense with controversy, incident and rancour, he had needed to win the final four races to overhaul Red Bull's Max Verstappen and win the championship.
A spectacular victory in Brazil - perhaps the best of his career - set him on course, and he dominated in Abu Dhabi until a late safety-car period.
Race director Michael Masi, under pressure from Red Bull to get the race restarted, ignored the correct procedure and improvised. Hamilton was left helpless on old tyres against his rival on new, and the title was wrenched from his grasp in one frenetic final lap.
After that, Hamilton disappeared for two months, trying to get his head around what had happened. He was thinking about the sport he loved, whether he could face coming back, and how to find the motivation again when he did.
""Was I ever truly not going to come back?"" he says now, thinking about the period with the benefit of nearly a year's hindsight. ""I am not one to give up like that, really.
""What really was breaking was to just believe that the sport would do something like that, that that would happen, given that there are so many people you rely on. You expect that the job would be done right. 
""And [that] an outcome of a world championship which so many people have worked so hard for would come out through a wrong decision from somebody, you know?
""That was probably the only thing. It wasn't for my lack of love for working with my team or racing cars; it was literally that. 
""If you can lose a championship through wrongdoing within an organisation, that was the thing that I wondered whether… 
""But I spent time with my family and that was really the best part of the healing, really. I just gave all of my time to the kids [his nephews and nieces], building snowmen and just being present with them. That enabled me to really recover, really bounce back. If I wasn't with them, I would have been stuck in a hole.""
Hamilton says that, even once he had decided he would come back, it was not plain sailing, even before he tried the Mercedes car for first time.
""I would say getting back into training was not easy,"" he says. ""It's not like you can just say, 'OK, right, motivation's there.' It definitely took a minute for me to build back in.""
Once he had, the plan was to ""come back stronger - and that's why I came back with fighting mentality. But then we had all the dramas with the car.""
""Dramas"" is something of an understatement. Mercedes produced their worst car in 10 years, a design with a fundamental aerodynamic flaw which took three months to solve. Once they had, other problems emerged.
former champions have made conspicuous progress this year, but the car is still significantly slower than Red Bull and Ferrari, and remains extremely difficult to drive.
Hamilton says trying to take this year's Mercedes to the limit is ""like creeping up behind a horse"".
""You're trying to get as close as possible,"" he says. ""What's the breaking point before it kicks you in the face? And you know it's going to hurt when it hits your face. 
""That's one of the best ways I can say what it's like when you're trying to lean on the car and it's snapping and unrecoverable. And this car, it's random.""
rying to resolve the car's problems, Hamilton says, has been ""gruelling"" for everyone at Mercedes. 
""We sat in February and we were all upbeat,"" he says. ""They were all telling us we were gonna have massive quick car.
""And I'm sure everyone who was working on it was so hyped with all the hard work they put in through the winter - it's such a gruelling time for everyone in the team; that's when they really crunch and out in the crazy hours. 
""To then find out the damn thing doesn't work, and we've got bouncing, that was hard for everybody. Everyone was really struggling, I think.
""And we all went through our own process of how to deal with it. But I think surprisingly it's been a really powerful transformational time for us all. We've got stronger and tighter as a team.""
Hamilton says he suspected it was going to be a long and difficult year immediately. 
""I had a feeling when I first drove the car,"" he says. ""But you can never say never. Maybe we would have fixed it by the first race. Who knows? 
""Plus, I'd never had bouncing like that. I didn't expect the guys to take as long… They didn't expect it to take as long as it's taken them to understand what's causing the bouncing. They've had to create new tools, all these things we didn't have before. 
""You just just hold on to hope. And then the next upgrade comes and it doesn't work, and the next one comes and doesn't work. 
""Imagine people that are building those things and they are seeing performance in the wind tunnel but they are not seeing it on the track. Ah Jesus, you just keep getting knocked back down. 
""But what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and we're still standing tall. It's not going to be easy to change the car into a leading car for next year but I think we have a much better understanding of why the car is the way it is.""
roblems with the car, and the complication that the engineers did not know how to fix them, created inaccurate impressions of Hamilton at the start of the season.
He had a handful of difficult races, including some bad luck with the timing of safety cars. His new team-mate George Russell built a lead over him in the championship, and people started to snipe from the sidelines, question whether Hamilton was past it, even whether he should have retired.
ruth was that Hamilton was taking the brunt of experimentation with the car on race weekends. 
""Literally, I have tried everything,"" he says. ""I've tried every setting you can possibly do. That's what I was doing at the beginning of the year. 
""The whole idea of performing at your best and getting the best result each weekend; of course that would be nice, but I was really about problem solving: 'I will sacrifice this session or all the sessions to be able to find more data and information for you.' So that when we go back to the factory they've got a better understanding of what's going on.' But it ultimately hindered some of the weekends.""
From about the Canadian Grand Prix in June onwards, Hamilton decided that this approach was not the best, and he began to focus more on performance rather than experimentation. And as he did, the picture began to change.
Russell has had a brilliant season. He is closer to Hamilton on pure performance than any team-mate since Fernando Alonso in 2007, and has very much consolidated his status as one of the brightest stars of the new generation, and a driver more than good enough to lead Mercedes in the future.
But while the average qualifying gap between them over the season is just 0.06secs, if you take only the races from Canada onwards, the margin is 0.175secs. 
Hamilton is ahead nine-four on their qualifying head-to-head at races where a fair comparison can be made, and has out-qualified Russell for the last six races in a row. Hamilton, Mercedes engineers say, is better able to cope with the car's unpredictability.
Russell remains ahead on points, and his season has been more consistent than Hamilton's, with fewer mistakes. But it is Hamilton who has produced the most competitive Mercedes race drives - in Spain, Silverstone, Hungary, the Netherlands and again at the US Grand Prix last weekend.
r's lack of performance has taken any tension out of the drivers' rivalry, allowed them to build a relationship without the pressures of a title fight, and Hamilton has taken on an almost paternal stance with his team-mate. But it's clear the competitive desire is still very much alive in him.
""George is doing a great job,"" Hamilton says. ""I don't have any problems with it. There's no issues in the background with us. 
""George, I would say, and his team, they don't experiment the same, obviously. But that's because I've been here for a long time, so I'm willing to take these risks. 
""I have the big, deep conversations with people I've been with for 10 years.  So, me and 'Shov' [Andrew Shovlin, Mercedes' engineering director] can have arguments, constructive arguments. 
""George, it's his first year with the team so he's come in and he's just doing his job to the best of his ability. Very little movement of set-up. I'm doing all the leg-work, back and forth here and there, different wings, all these different things. And I like that anyway. 
""If we come into next year and we have a car that we are much happier with, then we can be more focused on that whole… not having to go crazy with set-ups. Then we can have a better battle. 
""If he finishes ahead at the end of the season, I don't really feel anything about it. We're not in the championship. We are fourth and sixth. Now, if it was first and second, it's different.""
Hamilton's Mercedes contract expires at the end of next season, and he will turn 39 at the start of 2024. He has previously expressed doubts that he would be racing in F1 at the age of 40. But that now seems an inevitability. And here, for the first time, he says definitively that he will sign a new contract with Mercedes and race on beyond next season.
""We are going to do another deal,"" he says. ""We're going to sit down and we're going to discuss it in these next couple of months, I would say.

health	Dorset County Hospital stands down critical incident after one day	"A main hospital has stood down its critical incident status a day after the alert was imposed.
However, Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester said it remained under ""extreme pressure"".
It warned the New Year weekend could put services under more strain.
Elsewhere in Dorset, critical incidents remain in force at South Western Ambulance Service and University Hospitals Dorset NHS Trust, which runs hospitals in Bournemouth and Poole.
In a statement, Dorset County Hospital NHS Trust said: ""We continue to focus on making sure our patients are safe and keeping our critical services running. 
""Our teams remain incredibly busy and we are also about to enter another bank holiday weekend, which could add to the pressures we are already facing.""
On Thursday, the trust said staffing issues were affecting services.
It renewed appeals to people not to visit the emergency department with minor injuries and to be ready to collect relatives who are fit to be discharged from hospital.
Hospital trusts can declare a critical incident when they are worried they are on the brink of not being able to provide critical services, such as emergency care.
It paves the way for measures to be taken, such as redeployment of staff.

politics	NI Protocol: Poots' suspension of Brexit checks unlawful, court rules	"Edwin Poots' instruction to halt checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from GB was unlawful and taken for political reasons, the High Court has ruled.
urt quashed the instruction of the former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) agriculture minister.  
DUP opposes the Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposed the checks.
A challenge to the legality of the order was brought by a Sinn Féin member, another applicant named Edward Rooney, and Belfast City Council.  
Mr Poots was agriculture minister when he issued the instruction in February 2022, shortly before the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed when the DUP withdrew its first minister in protest against the protocol. 
Since January 2021, food products being sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have required a range of checks and controls due to the protocol.
rotocol is a deal between the UK and EU which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding the need for a hard border with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.
Unionist politicians have condemned what they regard as the imposition of a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Mr Poots said he had received legal advice that he could direct a halt to the checks in the absence of approval for the inspections from the wider Stormont Executive.
At the High Court on Thursday, Mr Justice Colton found the wider executive did not need to approve the checks.
""It is difficult to draw conclusion other than the decision under challenge was an overtly political one, taken for political reasons, and as part of a political campaign directed in opposition to the protocol,"" he said.
By Louise Cullen, BBC News NI agriculture and environment correspondent
judge's comments that Edwin Poots' instruction was ""overtly political"" will come as no surprise to those who have watched the former agriculture minister and his DUP colleagues collapse the assembly in their opposition to the legislation that seeks to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.  
judge recognised there was political opposition to the protocol, but said ""any politically motivated decision"" that was not in accordance with the law was ""unsustainable and must be set aside as a consequence"".
It's a fair bet that, had Mr Poots still been in place, there would be further court action to follow after this decision.  
As it is, it remains to be seen what steps the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs will now take in the absence of a minister.  
formally quash an instruction that never took effect comes as London and Brussels hold more talks to try to resolve the impasse, and after figures this week showed sales to GB had increased in the year since the protocol began to be implemented. 
He said the instruction had been issued at a time when the then DUP First Minister Paul Givan's resignation was imminent, and consistent with the party's previously declared strategy of opposition to the protocol.
""It may well be that for politicians, as the DUP leader said in September 2021 'there are no easy answers when the law requires one thing and politics demands something else',"" the judge said.
""From the court's perspective there is an easy answer and that is that the law must be obeyed.
""Any politically-motivated decision that is in accordance with the law is unimpeachable.
""Every such decision which does not satisfy this indelible standard is unsustainable in law and must be set aside as a consequence.""
Formally quashing Mr Poots' order to staff, Mr Justice Colton confirmed: ""By issuing the instruction on 2 February 2022, the minister was in breach of his legal obligations.
""The instruction was unlawful and of no effect.""
Despite Mr Poots' instruction, border checks on agri-food products entering Northern Ireland have been continuing pending the outcome of the judicial review proceedings.
Anonymity was granted to the Sinn Féin member who brough the challenge because of fears he might be targeted by loyalist paramilitaries."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63983399
technology	Rolls-Royce tests a jet engine running on hydrogen	"Jet engine running on hydrogen
In a windswept corner of a military site on Salisbury Plain a small aircraft jet engine is undergoing tests that could one day lead to huge changes within the aviation industry.
gine itself is almost completely conventional. It is a Rolls-Royce AE-2100A gas turbine, a design used widely on regional aeroplanes around the world.
What is wholly unusual about it is the fuel being used. This is the first time a modern aircraft engine has ever been run on hydrogen.
Devoid of bodywork, with its intricate wiring and pipework exposed, it sits securely fastened to a sturdy test rig, while engineers cluster around an array of screens in the control room, a safe distance away. 
re being carried out by Rolls-Royce, after development work in Derby and in partnership with the airline easyJet. 
mmediate aim is a simple one - to show that it is possible to run and control a jet engine using hydrogen fuel, rather than conventional aviation fuels.
In the longer term, the plan is for hydrogen power to play a major role in allowing the aviation industry to continue growing, while cutting climate change emissions dramatically.
""The reason we're looking at hydrogen is really the drive for Net Zero,"" explains Alan Newby, director of aerospace technology at Rolls-Royce.
""Normally we would run this thing on kerosene. Kerosene is a hydrocarbon and therefore produces carbon dioxide when it burns.
""The beauty of looking at a fuel like hydrogen is that it doesn't contain any carbon and, therefore, when it burns it produces no CO2"".
roject is being supported by easyJet, which has contributed several million pounds towards the initial trials.
mpany believes that hydrogen power offers the best route to reducing emissions from short haul aviation.
""We started a few years ago looking at what might power the aircraft of the future,"" explains David Morgan, easyJet's chief operating officer.
""We looked at battery technology, and it was quite clear that the battery technology was probably not going to do it for the large commercial aircraft that we fly.
""We've come to the conclusion that hydrogen is a very exciting proposition for us.""
ge of hydrogen over batteries is that it provides much more power per kilogram. Batteries are simply too heavy to power larger planes. 
Yet hydrogen aviation remains a very long way off. The tests carried out so far have simply shown that a jet engine using hydrogen can be started up and run at low speed.
But to go from there to building a wholly new engine, capable of powering a passenger aircraft safely will take a great deal more research - and significant investment.
rcraft themselves will also need to be redesigned. Hydrogen, even in liquid form, takes up about four times as much space as the kerosene required to fly the same distance.
make it into a liquid in the first place, it needs to be cooled to -253C. Then, before being burned, it must be turned back into a gas.
""There's a big change from the aircraft point of view,"" says Alan Newby at Rolls-Royce.
""They're going to have to have a tank containing the hydrogen. You've got to keep it at this really, really cold temperature. 
""Then there's the issue of how you feed it through to the engine as well.""
r key question is where the hydrogen itself comes from, because that will have a dramatic impact on the environmental benefits it can provide
fuel used in the tests is so-called green hydrogen produced at the European Marine Energy Centre in the Orkney Islands.
It is made by using an electric current to split water into its components, hydrogen and oxygen. The electricity required is produced using tidal and wind power. This makes it a very clean fuel.
But most of the hydrogen produced for industrial use today is obtained from a process which involves mixing high temperature steam with natural gas under high pressure.
However, this produces a considerable amount of carbon dioxide, which is then released into the atmosphere. It also requires a considerable amount of energy - which is often provided by burning fossil fuels.
One alternative is what's known as blue hydrogen. This is produced in the same way, but the carbon dioxide is captured and either stored or reused. 
In theory, this should make it a cleaner, low-carbon fuel. But that view was challenged in a paper from researchers at Cornell and Stanford universities last year.
uggested that in fact, using blue hydrogen could still be more harmful to the planet than burning fossil fuels.
More technology of business:
""At the moment there's a lot of hydrogen hype,"" says Matt Finch, UK policy director of campaign group Transport and Environment.
""A lot of people are saying 'we can use hydrogen, we need hydrogen'. You hear it for cars, for trucks, for ships, for planes, for home heating, for chemicals.
""At the moment the UK effectively produces zero green hydrogen. To fulfil all the needs everyone wants is absolutely impossible.""
Mr Finch believes this means supplies of green hydrogen will probably have to be rationed for decades to come, and he says aviation may not be a priority for governments.
All of this means it is likely to be decades before zero-emission hydrogen planes become an everyday reality. 
Even then, they are likely to be confined to short haul markets, at least to begin with. On long haul routes, synthetic sustainable fuels are widely expected to offer a more practical solution. 
Nevertheless, these first tests on Salisbury Plain may one day be seen as the first, tentative steps towards a technological revolution in the industry."	/news/business-63758937

Daniel Brocklebank, who plays vicar Billy Mayhew, said: ""There's something brilliantly depressing about how rundown it looks.
""I think Billy is probably going to be spending time in the charity shop.
Actor Sally Dynevor, who plays Sally Metcalfe, cut a red ribbon to officially open the set on Thursday.
work has been going on for nine months, while filming carried on around the building site.
Elle Mulvaney, who plays Amy Barlow, said: ""It's mint. It's the first time I've seen it and I can't get over the amount of detail.

entertainment	Eurovision fans 'gutted' as Glasgow loses out to Liverpool	"Eurovision fans in Scotland have been left stunned after Glasgow lost out to Liverpool in the bid to host next year's event.
Glasgow had been the bookies' favourite, with its cheerleaders including former winner Lulu and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
But Liverpool can now expect thousands of visitors and a slice of the global spotlight in May.
Lulu said her heart sank when the announcement was made.
But she added: ""You have to be a good loser. It's very important.
""And in the end you know the UK is hosting and that's what we've got to be grateful for - that we are now focused on supporting Liverpool doing a great job for Ukraine.
""My heart sunk, I have to say. But I'm such an old fart and have had a lot of disappointments in my life. I've managed to get over them and I suppose I'll get over this one, but I thought we were going to do it.""
Ms Sturgeon said she was ""gutted"" that Glasgow had missed out.
""Congratulations, Liverpool. Gutted for Glasgow, but no doubt you'll do Eurovision and Ukraine proud,"" the first minister tweeted.
Friday's announcement came after a hotly-contested bidding process, which saw 20 possible host cities cut to a final two.
w is coming to the UK for the first time in 25 years after this year's winner, Ukraine, was unable to take up hosting duties due to the war.
M&S Bank Arena in Liverpool will stage the 67th edition of the event on 13 May.
Essex singer Sam Ryder finished second place in May, making the UK the default hosts.
Broadcaster and Eurovision TV commentator Graham Norton announced the Eurovision host city on the BBC's The One Show.
Cities were judged on criteria including a suitable venue, strength of the cultural offer, commitment to making a financial contribution and ""alignment with the BBC's strategic priorities"".
BBC said both cities had provided ""incredibly strong bids"" and each ""proposed to reflect Ukrainian culture and music in their own unique way"" but that Liverpool eventually won out.
Scottish fans voiced their disappointment at missing out to Liverpool on social media.
Anna took to Twitter to say, ""Have a lot of mixed feelings tonight. 
""I'm obviously a little gutted Glasgow wasn't chosen, but genuine congratulations to Liverpool. I have no doubt they'll put on an amazing show for Ukraine.""
Another fan, Fiona, also posted: ""Gutted for Glasgow but I'm sure Liverpool will be amazing hosts.""
""Gutted for Glasgow"" was the first minister's reaction to the news that the city had lost out to Liverpool in its bid to host the 2023 Eurovision contest.
For once, the golden envelope which Graham Norton ripped open live on The One Show contained a genuinely surprising result.
You need only look at the faces of those gathered in Kelvingrove Art Gallery for the announcement. Shock, disappointment, and a sombre walk home in the Glasgow rain.
Lulu, one of the few people who can claim to have actually won the Eurovision Song Contest (Boom Bang-A-Bang in 1969) was convinced that her home city had won.
""My heart sunk, I have to say, I thought we were going to do it.""
roblem was that both cities thought they were going to do it. Both had exactly the same credentials: a good infrastructure, an arena with room for 10,000 fans, a track record for organising major events. Both are Unesco Cities of Music. Both are known for their humour and for their warm welcome. Either would throw a fine party.
Scotland has played its part in Eurovision history. The 1972 contest was staged here, back in the day when the audience dressed in dinner suits and clapped politely for earnest French ballads. It's quite a different prospect now.
As well as the vast social and economic benefits of having such a major event on your doorstep, there's the added emotion of the show being hosted in the UK because the actual winners, Ukraine, are unable to safely do so. Even the most hard-hearted Eurovision sceptic couldn't fail to be drawn in by that.
Although disappointed, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said she hoped Liverpool would ""gie it laldy"" for Ukraine.
OVO Hydro, which would have been the venue for the show had Glasgow been chosen, tweeted ""we are disappointed that Glasgow has not been chosen as host city of Eurovision 2023 but we know our friends and colleagues in Liverpool will do an incredible job.""
And to Liverpool's M&S Bank Arena: ""you know where we are if you need a little extra laldy""."	/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-63177417
health	Pharmacists run out of penicillin as strep A demand soars	"Pharmacists say they are running out of penicillin as demand soars to treat suspected cases of strep A.
""I can tell you that I've got 10 bottles this minute, in the next hour I might have none,"" said Sandeep Dhami.
Nigel Dugmore from Donnington Pharmacy, Telford said customers were travelling over 20 miles (32km) to find medicine.
Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has said there is ""no supplier shortage of antibiotics available"".
""We're getting people from all across Shropshire, Staffordshire, Cheshire, people from the Black Country,"" said Mr Dugmore, adding he was fielding up to 50 calls a day from worried parents.
""Over the past two to three weeks we've probably given out 4 to 500 bottles... Demand has probably increased 10 or fifteenfold easily.""
rmacist predicted a fresh delivery of penicillin, after the pharmacy ran out on Monday, would last no more than a day and a half.
""The main thing is, please don't panic, and I would suggest that parents go on to social media to see if there is stock available,"" he added.
Elizabeth Walker, Deputy Director of Medicines Management at NHS Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, said GPs were being kept updated with wholesaler availability of common antibiotics.
""Stock shortages are expected to be short term and the Department of Health and Social Care is in discussions with manufacturers to mitigate the current issues,"" she added.
Another pharmacist described seeing parents ""in desperation"" amid ""unprecedented demand"".
""I was in the Kingstanding area this morning and there was a guy waiting outside for me... 'Have I got this for his 3-year-old daughter?'"" said Mr Dhami, pharmacy superintendent at M.W. Phillips.
""We had a bottle of amoxicillin in the store - the look of joy, I was like Father Christmas to him. He nearly broke down in tears in front of me.
""I don't know when my next bottle is coming in, or where it's coming from,"" added Mr Dhami. ""The minute I try and do an audit I've got more prescriptions coming in and it's gone."" 
Lela Hannbeck from The Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies said members were also being left out of pocket as ""the price that pharmacies are currently being charged for antibiotics is much higher than what they get reimbursed.""
DHSC reiterated there was ""no supplier shortage of antibiotics available to treat strep A"".
""We sometimes have surges for products and increased demand means some pharmacies are having difficulties obtaining certain antibiotics,"" a spokesperson said.
""We rely on competition to drive down the prices of generic medicines which generally results in lower prices for the NHS - this means prices can fluctuate, but no company should use this as an opportunity to exploit the NHS.
""Where companies are found to be abusing their dominant position by charging excessive and unfair prices, the Competition and Markets Authority can take action.""

Stuart and Amanda Stephens attended a debate on the Online Safety Bill in the House of Commons.
mpaigned for tighter restrictions on tech firms after it transpired a fatal attack on their son Olly was planned on social media.
government has said it wants the bill to pass during this session.
rteen-year-old Olly Stephens was stabbed to death near his home in Reading by teenagers who plotted his killing across numerous social media platforms.
Stuart and Amanda Stephens have previously spoken about their increasing exasperation with the government for repeated delays to the bill.
roposed legislation is intended to end self-regulation for social media firms and force them to remove harmful content. 
watched the report stage of the bill in the House of Commons from the public gallery, along with other parents including Ian Russell, father of Molly who took her own life in 2017 after watching images of self-harm and suicide on Instagram and Pinterest.
gether, the parents have formed the Bereaved Families for Online Safety initiative, supported by the NSPCC to campaign for a safer internet for children.
A joint statement said the Online Safety Bill was a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to save families like ours from the horrific, unending pain of losing a child"".
Mr Stephens said afterwards that he had ""faith"" the bill would be passed.
He said: ""Children are curious, they can find anything, anywhere [on social media] - it's the responsibility of the companies to control that feed.
""Hopefully this will set the standard globally, other countries will adopt the same policies and we all stand together. We're feeling a lot more positive.""
Having seen the debate from the public gallery, Mrs Stephens said there had been ""a lot of empathy"" for parents in their position.
""They mentioned our names and our children's names and that means the world - that feeling of care and who has been affected by this,"" he said.
""I got the feeling the power will be taken away from the social media companies. They wont be able to continue as they are - not caring, not doing anything. Ofcom will have teeth.
""It's given me more of a feeling of hope that it is going to happen now"".
Speaking during the debate in the Commons, shadow culture minister Alex Davies-Jones said the bill was ""unnecessarily overly-complicated"" and paid tribute to the families who lost children to online harm.
""I sincerely hope this evening's debate will do justice to their incredible hard work and commitment in the most exceptionally difficult of circumstances,"" she added.
Culture secretary Michelle Donelan said the Online Safety Bill was a ""ground-breaking piece of legislation"".
""The sooner we pass this bill, the sooner we can start protecting children online. It will need to evolve as technology changes.""
She said a planned two-day committee stage ""will not delay or derail the bill"" from receiving royal assent during the current parliamentary session.

politics	No 10 backs Suella Braverman amid MI5 leak row	"No 10 has said Suella Braverman has ""strong relationships"" with the security services, following concerns about her return as home secretary. 
Reports have emerged suggesting that, as attorney general, she was investigated over the leak of a story involving MI5. 
Ms Braverman was reappointed as home secretary just days after she resigned over separate data breaches. 
Several Conservative MPs have raised questions about her reappointment.
Mark Pritchard - a former member of Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee - said in a tweet: ""MI5 need to have confidence in the home secretary, whoever that might be.
""It's a vital relationship of trust, key to the UK's security and democratic oversight of MI5. Any breakdown in that relationship is bad for the security service and the government. It needs to be sorted asap.""
Asked whether Prime Minister Rishi Sunak believed MI5 had confidence in Ms Braverman, his official spokesperson said: ""Yes, the home secretary continues to have strong relationships with all the operational bodies that report into the Home Office and are focused very much on keeping the country safe.""
Asked if Mr Sunak was concerned security analysts might be reluctant to share information with the Home Office, the official said: ""No, and any suggestion of that would be entirely false."" 
In January, the Daily Telegraph reported that Ms Braverman was seeking an injunction to block a BBC story about a spy working for British intelligence.
riefing received by the newspaper damaged the government's argument that publishing details of the court case could harm national security.
Mr Justice Chamberlain said it would be a ""matter of concern"" if Ms Braverman was seeking to hold part of the hearing in private while, at the same time, the government was briefing the press. 
r judge said he had been provided with no evidence to undermine the inference that a government source was responsible for briefing the paper.
High Court later ruled the BBC could publish the story, though an injunction still bars the corporation from identifying the man.
An inquiry was launched to find out who had leaked confidential details of the court case to the Telegraph.
High Court permits publication of the fact there was a leak inquiry, but the government has so far refused to comment.
Cabinet Office has not responded to the BBC's questions about the leak inquiry including whether or not Ms Braverman was questioned, if the police were involved, or if anyone was arrested or questioned under caution. The attorney general's office also did not respond to queries.
Labour is calling for a probe into the reports in the Daily Mail that Ms Braverman was investigated over the leak. 
Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""The prime minister needs to say whether he knew about these allegations when he reappointed her. Ignoring warnings about security risks when appointing a home secretary is highly irresponsible and dangerous. We need answers now.""
Raising the matter in the House of Lords, former Home Secretary Lord David Blunkett told peers the security and intelligence services could be reluctant to brief the home secretary and that other international security agencies would be reluctant to share information with the UK ""if they're fearful that information will be passed out from government itself"".
SNP's Ian Blackford says new PM Sunak did a ""sleazy backroom deal"" with Braverman to gain post
Separately, opposition parties and some Tory MPs have also questioned Ms Braverman's reappointment as home secretary after she admitted sending an official document to someone not authorised to receive it. 
She stepped down from her cabinet position last week in the final days of Liz Truss's premiership. 
In her resignation letter, she admitted committing a ""technical infringement"" of the rules.
""I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility; I resign,"" she wrote.
However, just six days later Mr Sunak reappointed Ms Braverman as home secretary.
It came two days after Ms Braverman had thrown her support behind him in the contest to replace Ms Truss, in what was widely seen as a significant endorsement by an influential figure on the right of the Conservative Party.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the new prime minister of giving Ms Braverman a job in exchange for her support.
Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for inquiries into Ms Braverman's appointment.
Caroline Nokes - Conservative MP for Romsey and Southampton North - agreed there should be an inquiry, saying there were ""big questions"" hanging over the issue. 
""To be frank I would like to see them cleared up so that the home secretary can get on with her job,"" she told BBC Radio Solent.
Jake Berry - who served as party chairman under Ms Truss but was fired by Mr Sunak - has also questioned Ms Braverman's return to the cabinet, saying there had been ""multiple breaches"" of the rules. 
He told Talk TV that Ms Braverman had sent a document ""from a private email address to another MP, she then sought to copy in that individual's wife but accidentally sent it to a staffer in Parliament"". 
""To me, that seems to be a really serious breach - the cabinet secretary had his say at the time. I doubt he has changed his mind in the last six days,"" he added. 
A No 10 spokesperson has denied reports that Cabinet Secretary Simon Case - the head of the civil service - was ""livid"" about the appointment.
New party chairman Nadhim Zahawi defended Ms Braverman's reappointment, telling the BBC he believed in ""redemption"".
""The prime minister looked at this case and he decided to give her a second chance,"" he added.
BBC has been told that the home secretary has requested further briefings on email security."	/news/uk-politics-63410737

entertainment	Angry Dan mural project 'brings colour' to Cleator Moor	"A street artist is ""bringing colour"" to a Cumbrian town in a project inspired by five great British artists.
Angry Dan is creating five murals in Cleator Moor to celebrate the work of William Wordsworth, JMW Turner, Beatrix Potter, John Ruskin and LS Lowry.
reet artist and poet's latest work is influenced by the area's ""historic importance as a location for artistic inspiration"".
He said the response from the local community has been ""fantastic"".
""So many people of all ages have come up to say hello and ask about the project.
""I ran out of white acrylic paint yesterday, and a local artist, Richard Wood, invited me to his studio and gave me a pot of his own supply.""
Angry Dan, from Walthamstow, east London, is known for his vibrant colours and memorable rhymes - writing an original limerick which he paints on each mural.
One of the five murals is now complete on the Columba Club - the former Co-op - in the town square.
38-year-old said it ""seemed fitting"" the mural should be dedicated to Lowry's time in the town.
""It's a building that LS Lowry came and painted and drew in the 1950s, so this mural specifically is about that artwork,"" he said.
""And it's a limerick poem - a five-line poem - which I've written on a pen pot with three crayons in to represent the pastel that Lowry used.""
During his time in the town, the artist is carrying out a series of limerick-writing workshops with children and young adults.

politics	Is Nicola Sturgeon losing her grip on the SNP?	"f Stephen Flynn as the SNP's Westminster leader has been portrayed by other parties as a blow for the authority of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
Mr Flynn is replacing a close ally of Ms Sturgeon in Ian Blackford, and won a contest against another in Alison Thewliss.
But with the two politicians insisting they will work together towards their shared goal of Scottish independence, has talk of divisions within Scotland's most dominant political force been overstated?
SNP has been quick to dismiss any notion of schisms within the party as ""complete fiction"".
Ms Sturgeon swiftly congratulated Mr Flynn and his deputy Mhairi Black as a ""truly formidable team"", saying she was ""looking forward to working with them both"".
She has also insisted that the move to replace Mr Blackford was ""not a coup"" - but it is a fact that Mr Flynn's name was being linked with moves to replace the Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP in the weeks before he decided to step down.
Mr Flynn initially denied he was planning a leadership bid despite talk of him being ""on manoeuvres"". 
But the Aberdeen South MP has since conceded that something was going on, stating that ""it's not unusual in political parties for people to court the support or opinion of their colleagues"".
me off the back of months of speculation about whether there could be a change, which was so widespread that Boris Johnson used to poke fun at Mr Blackford about it on a weekly basis at prime minister's questions.
Mr Flynn was floated as an alternative who might prove a punchier figure, who would have more of a go at the Westminster establishment - and perhaps, whispered some, the SNP's internal one.
After Mr Blackford announced his departure, Mr Flynn hoped for a coronation - one ally told BBC Scotland they would be ""astonished"" if anyone else ran for the job - and it is understood that the 34-year-old met Ms Sturgeon for talks.
However those hopes were dashed when Alison Thewliss - a Glasgow MP widely seen as being much closer to the first minister - announced she would be running. 
Ms Thewliss stressed her credentials as a ""team player"", saying she would ""work closer and smarter"" with the Scottish government, and ultimately won the backing of 17 MPs to Mr Flynn's 26.
So it may be the case that recent events have not played out in exactly the way either Mr Flynn or Ms Sturgeon might have wanted.
But now that Mr Flynn is in the post, both will be looking forward - because the role of the SNP's Westminster group might be about to become more important than ever before.
Stephen Flynn takes part in his first Prime Minister's Questions
With plans for an independence referendum next year having hit the buffers, the party is looking to use the next general election as a single-issue campaign.
means the constitutional question could be answered not by people voting Yes or No, but by putting a cross in a box next to the name of someone like Stephen Flynn or Alison Thewliss.
MPs like John McNally and Marion Fellows may not have garnered a huge profile in politics to date, but they are going to be on the frontline of what their party hopes will be the decisive contest in its independence campaign.
re have been some rumblings about the strategy already, with high profile MP Angus MacNeil suggesting that a snap Holyrood election might be better suited as a ""de facto referendum"" than a general election would be.
And Ms Black and Stewart McDonald have both sought to talk down some of the rhetoric which flew around about Scotland being ""oppressed"" or a ""colony"" in the wake of November's Supreme Court ruling.
So the key question about Mr Flynn's regime is whether he can pull his group together and get them marching in unison ahead of the next election, which is currently expected in 2024.
Westminster group has always been slightly more restive, being further from Ms Sturgeon's control and lacking a clear purpose as the third party in a parliament all of its members would like to leave.
But there have been rumblings of discontent in the first minister's back yard at Holyrood too.
In October, the SNP suffered its largest ever backbench rebellion over the government's plans to make it easier for people to change their legally recognised gender. 
One minister resigned to vote against the plans, and eight other MSPs broke the whip - accounting for 20% of the party's backbench group.
ue back in parliament in the days before the Christmas break, and there will be a series of further votes on amendments before the big vote whether the bill becomes law.
It is still expected to pass, and ministers hope this will put the issue to bed at least from a parliamentary standpoint.
And it is fair to say that there are not many other issues like gender reform coming up at Holyrood on which SNP members would be likely to rebel en masse.
But there has been criticism on some other fronts too, with SNP members of Holyrood's finance committee hitting out about the lack of detail in financial plans for the National Care Service.
me committee is set to hold an inquiry into ""effective decision-making by government"". 
It's possible this could signal an outbreak of independent thinking from MSPs in a parliament where party whips have been utterly dominant.
Does all of this add up to a real headache for Ms Sturgeon?
It may be more the case that these grumbles are side-effects of the greater question facing the independence movement, as its strategy begins to pivot away from holding a referendum next year.
For the entirety of Ms Sturgeon's record-breaking tenure as first minister, the plan has been to secure and win a referendum.
She has repeatedly predicted that Westminster opposition to indyref2 would prove unsustainable, and would crumble in the face of one more electoral mandate. It has not.
And having pushed a case to the Supreme Court and lost, the SNP leader is now drawing up plans for a de facto referendum - an approach she previously used to write off as a ""unionist trap"" when proposed by opponents within the SNP.
re are a great many questions to be answered about how a de facto referendum would work, and whether it could actually deliver independence with international recognition. 
It may be that this uncertainty is what has sparked questions about Ms Sturgeon's grip on her party too.
She will hold a special party conference in the new year in a bid to settle the issue of process - and if she can do that, it's entirely possibly she will put the wider questions about her authority to bed too.
If the independence movement and its political representatives are focused on the greater prize and feel it is truly close at hand, they will frankly have less time to spend on infighting.
And unlike at Westminster, there does not appear to be any particular challenge to Ms Sturgeon's leadership from ambitious colleagues.
Not only is nobody plotting a move against the first minister, the leadership doesn't seem to have any succession plans of its own in the pipeline. 
re are few obvious signs of a future first minister being groomed within the ministerial team.
So in the next phase of the debate, Ms Sturgeon's position is still assured. But given she is hoping the coming years will answer the constitutional question once and for all, this period will likely prove decisive in terms of her own future too."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63886994
entertainment	Enys Men: Film poster a Cornish language breakthrough	"A new film from acclaimed Cornish director Mark Jenkin features a poster in Cornish.
use of the language is thought to be a first on a poster for a feature film, said producer Denzil Monk.
Enys Men, which follows the Bafta-award winning Bait from Mr Jenkin, is described as a ""folk horror"".
film revolves around a wildlife volunteer whose daily observations of a strange flower on a lonely island take a dark turn.
Mr Monk said: ""To the best of our knowledge it is the first time a Cornish language poster has been used for a distributed feature film.
""It gives the sense that the language was the language of the island and it's nice to highlight this aspect of the film.
""The Cornish language is also thriving, the number of people speaking it is growing all the time and it's started to break into mainstream culture.
""To see it normalised in this way is really important for its future and makes it more visible.""
Cornish language was also an ""essential element"" in the film which includes song written by Mercury Prize 2022 nominee Gwenno. 
""This is a Cornish production through and through and a celebration of Cornwall's rich folklore, its tin and copper mining heritage, relationship with the sea and stunning natural beauty,"" said Mr Monk.
w film is due for UK-wide release on 13 January along with a series of screenings in Cornwall, Devon and Bristol with Mr Jenkin.
Cornish was recognised by the UK Government as a minority language in 2002, it is used in more than 3,000 bilingual street signs and companies such as St Austell Brewery use the language on their products.

business	Employment rate for women in Scotland reaches record high	"mployment rate for women of working age in Scotland is at a record high, according to official figures.
 Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that 75.6% of women aged between 16 and 64 were in work between August and October.
ghest rate recorded since the labour force survey began in 1992.
Scotland's employment rate for all people of working age rose by 0.7% from the previous three months, to match its highest ever level of almost 76%.
However unemployment in Scotland increased slightly.
figures, released on Tuesday, showed that the number of people unavailable for work fell to 21.4%. 
And while there was a slight increase from early in the summer in the rate of unemployment, it remained at a very low level. The figure of 3.3% was below the UK jobless rate of 3.7%. 
ONS figures also showed that the pay of employed people across the UK rose by 6.1% on average over the year to October.
However, the effect of inflation meant that real spending power fell by 2.7%. 
Public sector workers saw an average fall in real earnings of 6.1%.
Scotland's employment minister, Richard Lochhead, said the employment rate had reached a joint record high, despite new GDP data showing a contraction in the economy during the third quarter.
Mr Lochhead said: ""This is against the backdrop of the serious challenges which businesses are facing from the cost crisis, high inflation, the continued impact of Brexit and the economic consequences of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.
""Through our Fair Work policy, we are supporting development of a labour market that is open and inclusive, while the ambitious National Strategy for Economic Transformation is helping deliver high-quality and sustainable jobs in the green economy.""
UK government's Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said Scotland's labour market had continued to ""demonstrate its resilience"".
He added: ""The UK government is committed to helping people find and progress in work, and to drive sustainable economic growth.
""The chancellor set out a number of measures in the Autumn Statement to put public finances on a secure footing and to promote economic growth - steps that are already making a positive contribution to tackling inflationary pressures."" "	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63954795
politics	Rishi Sunak pledges police powers to tackle illegal protests	"Rishi Sunak has said it is ""completely unacceptable"" that people were having their lives disrupted by a ""selfish minority"" who join illegal protests.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman has met with police chief constables to discuss tactics used by some environmental protest groups, such as Just Stop Oil.
rime minister said: ""My view is that those who break the law should feel the full force of it.""
Speaking after the meeting at No 10 he said the police had his support.
Ms Braverman and policing minister Chris Philp met with police chiefs on Thursday and were joined by Mr Sunak at the start.
rime minister said the police were already being given new powers to clamp down on illegal protests and would have his full support in acting decisively to end ""the misery and disruption"" caused to ordinary families.
""I've said to them [the police] whatever they need from government they will have in terms of new powers, we're already giving them some, and I want to back them to use them.""
Following the talks in Downing Street, police chiefs described the meeting as ""constructive"". 
Chief Constable BJ Harrington said the police were ""not anti-protest, but we are anti-crime"".
A statement said: ""Police are committed to responding quickly and effectively to activists who deliberately disrupt people's lives through dangerous, reckless, and criminal acts.""
He said the meeting showed a commitment to tackling criminal activism while respecting lawful protest.
Earlier Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said Just Stop Oil protesters were being ""much less assertive"" because their suspected leaders are in custody.
He suggested that efforts by officers were having an effect, but admitted some criminal trials might not take place for two years amid delays in the criminal justice system. 
Speaking at the London Assembly, Sir Mark said he was ""absolutely determined"" that anything that goes beyond lawful, reasonable protest would be ""dealt with robustly"". 
Earlier this week, Jan Goodey - a Just Stop Oil protester - who took part in a protest which saw ""mile after mile"" of tailbacks on the M25 after climbing up a gantry was jailed for six months. He admitted causing a public nuisance.

entertainment	Wolverhampton Civic Hall: Opening date set for £48m revamped music venue	"Wolverhampton Civic Hall to reopen in June 2023
A Grade-II listed music venue is set to open after a much delayed £48m revamp. 
Wolverhampton's Civic and Wulfrun Halls will open to the public in June 2023 as part of a complex called The Halls.
Operators AEG Presents will be handed the keys to the venue next month with final construction work complete.
uncil estimates the venue will boost the city economy by more than £10m per year and said it would attract entertainment events as well as being used for sport and conferences.
84-year-old venue will hold a series of test events next spring. 
re are also plans for ""small-scale community preview events"" before Christmas.
's Civic Halls closed in December 2015 but after initial renovation works began, more serious issues came to light, delaying the completion date. 
further due to the pandemic, the city council previously said. 
Council leader Ian Brookfield described the venue as a ""beloved part of our city for multiple generations"".
rator's chief executive, Steve Homer, who is from the city, said the venue had hosted artists from The Clash, David Bowie and Nirvana to the Manic Street Preachers and Morrissey.
""It's incredible to be able to bring an iconic venue back to life, and as a local lad this is all the more special,"" he said. 
Improvements to the venue include upgraded seats, a greater number of bars as well as revamped toilets, and lift access to the new balcony level.

sports	Southport rugby player's emotional return after leukaemia	"A teenager, who had not played rugby for three years while being treated for leukaemia, has said returning to the pitch was ""emotional"" as it was his ""light at the end of the tunnel"". 
Connor Ellerton, 17, from Southport, was diagnosed with cancer in 2019.
His comeback for Southport Colts was marked with a guard of honour and standing ovation from his teammates.
He said he had been ""desperate"" to put the kit on again and that ""lovely gesture"" made it ""very special"".
Connor has played at Southport Rugby Football Club since he was five, while also playing at school, and he has grown up with most of the squad.  
""Rugby has been in my life as long as I remember,"" he said. 
""I played almost every day and I was desperate to play again. It was my light at the end of the tunnel.""
Connor said being back in the changing room was ""amazing"" and then walking through the tunnel with a guard of honour by both his own team and opponents Sandbach U18 Colts was a ""lovely gesture"".
His mother, Joanne Dennett, said Connor was treated for ear infections in the months before he was diagnosed with the blood cancer. 
He had to undergo gruelling treatment but sailed through his GCSEs - passing nine with grades A and B.
However, Ms Dennett said not being able to play rugby was tough for Connor, although he did still attend games. 
""He found missing rugby the hardest thing,"" she said, adding that he just wanted to get back to playing with his friends.
Now he is in remission, Ms Dennett said she did not expect the club to ""make such a fuss"" of Connor but they had always been supportive.
""The club is like family. They always go above and beyond.
""It was amazing - a lovely surprise.""
ff his comeback, Connor was awarded man of the match as his side beat Sandbach in the North West Colts League 26-19. 
""Winning the game made it even better,"" he said.

technology	Can electrical stimulation improve your gym workout?	"first time that long-distance rower Lebby Eyres tried exercising in the gym while wearing a whole-body electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) suit, she says ""it felt strange"".
""I got into the suit, and then trainers sprayed me with water, and strapped these things around my arms, legs and glutes (buttocks),"" says the 51-year-old. ""I thought to myself, 'am I really going to be able to exercise wearing these?'
""Then the [electrical] stimulus of the machine gave me the most unusual sensations.""
When she woke up the following morning at home in London, Mrs Eyres says her muscles had the level of soreness that she typically got from working out for a few hours, yet she had only exercised for 20 minutes.
EMS has long been used by doctors to help improve the mobility of people with a number of health conditions, such as patients recovering from a stroke, or people with multiple sclerosis.
Using low currents of electricity to stimulate muscles and nerves, it is also often used by mothers during childbirth, in the form of a piece of equipment called a tens machine, to try to alleviate the pain. This sees the woman fix sticky pads to her lower back, and then use a hand-held controller to adjust the level of electrical charge that the pads emit. 
While those health usages typically focus on one area of the body, whole-body EMS suits (which typically comprise a short-sleeved top and shorts) are now a fast-growing trend in the fitness and gym world.
rical stimulation of your muscles speeds up the effect of exercising and strengthening. So you can do a 20-minute workout that is equivalent to one lasting 90 minutes if you weren't wearing the body suit.
While this might sound fanciful to many of us, the number of gyms offering EMS has been increasing quickly. One such provider, US chain Iron BodyFit, is continuing to expand in Europe after opening more than 100 studios in France over the past five years.
It launched its first UK venue in London last year, and plans a dozen more over the next 12 months. Other chains that focus on EMS, and are expanding in the UK, include Feel Electric and Surge.
Such growth is helping to drive the overall global market for EMS, which one report says will grow by 51% from $122m in 2020 to $184m in 2030.
But does EMS actually work in the fitness sphere? Does it really improve the efficiency of your workout and give you bigger muscles for less effort? And more importantly - is it always safe?
""We are bypassing the brain,"" says Phil Horton, UK director for German firm Miha Bodytec, one of the largest manufacturers of EMS body suits. ""We can trigger the muscle in a smarter and more efficient way compared to the way the brain would tell the muscle to move.""
He adds that the small electrical charge more easily reaches deep muscle tissue. Water is often sprayed on the suit to boost conductivity.
roblem for the EMS fitness sector is that studies into whether it works are very mixed, and even those that are positive use a lot of words like ""might"", ""could"", or ""may"".
One report back in 2011 said that the use of EMS ""has been acknowledged"" to help lead to ""significant improvements in strength"". Yet it then immediately added that such changes are ""still ambiguous"", ""poorly understood"" and ""require more study"".
An article earlier this year concluded that the jury was still very much out.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Meanwhile, the US Food & Drug Administration, which regulates EMS machines, says that when used for fitness they ""may be able to temporarily strengthen, tone or firm a muscle"", but only if accompanied by exercise and dieting.
It also cautions against the use of unregulated devices, as these may cause ""shocks, burns, bruising, skin irritation, and pain"".
Nicola Maffiuletti, a sports science expert at Swiss orthopaedic clinic Schulthess Klinik, has also long been critical of whole-body EMS.
""In particular, whole-body electrical stimulation is extremely difficult to dose properly,"" he says, adding that under-dosage means no effect, while over-dosage could cause muscle damage.
""So if we objectively look at the harmful versus beneficial effects of whole-body electrical stimulation, there are no strong arguments in favour of its use.""
Veteran US weightlifter Robert Herbst's opposition to whole-body EMS is more straightforward. The 64-year-old thinks it simply does not work.
""The stress put on your muscles by EMS is insufficient to create the micro-trauma weightlifting creates,"" says Mr Herbst, who has won several world and American championships, and still competes.
Yet US exercise physiologist Tom Holland says full-body EMS is useful because it can encourage people to do more exercise.  ""Squats, lunges, crunches, bicep curls and other traditional exercises are more fun when done through EMS,"" he says.
However, he says it is often not cheap, with prices in the US as high as $125 (£110), and those in the UK reaching as much as £130 per 20-minute session.
Back in London, Ms Eyres used whole-body EMS to help her train for rowing across the Atlantic in the 2021 Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge. She successfully completed the event, rowing in a boat with three friends.
She says that thanks in part to the use of EMS ""my abs are much better now than when I was 21"". 
""Everyone complimented me on my much stronger and toned figure."""	/news/business-62887379
