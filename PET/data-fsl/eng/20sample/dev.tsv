technology	Holocaust activist seems to talk to guests at her funeral	"Holocaust campaigner Marina Smith appeared able to answer questions at a funeral celebration of her life, thanks to new technology - her son has said.
Mrs Smith died in June, aged 87, but video technology, built by her son's firm, meant those attending her funeral could watch her respond to their questions about her life.
Stephen Smith said it enabled his mother to be ""present, in a sense"".
His company predicts many uses for its ""conversational video technology"".
use of the technology at Mrs Smith's funeral was first revealed by The Telegraph. 
Mr Smith, the chief executive and co-founder of StoryFile, told the BBC the technology meant, once a person had died, it was possible to have a conversation with them ""as if they are there, and they will answer you"".
He said it meant his mother had brought ""the aspects of her life that were most important to her to the people who loved her most. And it was very meaningful to them"".
His mother's words were her own, and not the creation of artificial intelligence (AI), Mr Smith stressed.
make a conversational video, a person must make a recording while still alive, answering numerous questions about their life.
Later, after that person's death, an AI system selects appropriate clips to play in response to questions from people viewing a remembrance video; the person in the video appears to listen and reply.
Rollo Carpenter, who created the chatbot CleverBot - and has no connection to Mr Smith's company StoryFile - said the system was not trying to construct its own replies and was not using AI to invent answers.
""It's just selecting from a pre-recorded set of sequences and cleverly allowing people to cause them to be played,"" he said.
Mrs Smith co-founded the National Holocaust Centre in Nottinghamshire, from where she ran a successful Holocaust education programme. She was awarded an MBE in 2005 for her work.
founders of StoryFile hit upon the idea for the company while working on creating interactive holograms of Holocaust survivors for the USC Shoah Foundation.
firm sees a wide range of possible commercial applications for the technology, from customer service to sales.
It has also encouraged some famous contemporary celebrities to document their careers using the tech, including the Star Trek actor William Shatner, whose video can be interacted with on the company website.
Looking ahead, Mr Smith envisages a world in which people document their lives on a continuous basis, suggesting that users could ""speak to your 18-year-old self, when you're 50, or introduce your children to your 16-year-old self"".
Previously, it has been suggested that AI could be used to create fully synthetic versions of dead people.
But Mr Smith rejects the idea that current technology is capable of this: ""Everything about us is so absolutely unique to us,"" he said. ""There is no way you can create a synthetic version of me, even though it may look like me.""
Mr Carpenter agrees, saying that using current AI technology to create a ""computer-generated"" person  would risk ""putting words into the deceased person's mouth - and it could be worse than that, those words could be believed by the audience"".
mits of AI conversationalists were demonstrated by Meta's BlenderBot 3, which was criticised for making offensive remarks and said unflattering things about the company's co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.
Meta said that it was a prototype created for research purposes, adding it had warned users they should expect it to say things it ideally should not."	/news/technology-62552696
business	HSBC to end funding for new oil and gas fields	"HSBC has announced it will stop financing new oil and gas fields, as part of its efforts to drive down global greenhouse gas emissions.
Environment groups said the move sends ""a strong signal"" to fossil fuel giants that investment is waning.
Europe's largest bank said it made the decision after receiving advice from international energy experts.
It comes following previous criticism of HSBC for funding oil and gas projects despite its green pledges.
Jeanne Martin, head of the banking programme at ShareAction, a charity that campaigns for reducing investment for fossil fuels like oil and gas, said: ""HSBC's announcement sends a strong signal to fossil fuel giants and governments that banks' appetite for financing new oil and gas fields is diminishing.""
rity called on other banks to follow suit - saying this move sets a ""a new minimum level of ambition"" for the sector.
In 2020, HSBC made a pledge to be ""net zero"" - which means not adding to greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere - and investing and loaning up to $1 trillion (£806bn) in green projects.
However, the bank came under criticism earlier this year when it was revealed it had invested an estimated $8.7bn (£6.4bn) into new oil and gas in 2021, according to ShareAction.
In the update to its energy policy, the bank said the decision had been made ""follow[ing] consultation with leading scientific and international bodies"" who had estimated that current oil and gas fields would meet any demand in 2050 under a ""net-zero"" scenario.
Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises ""well below"" 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
Experts say that to achieve this, net zero must be reached by 2050.
HSBC follows Lloyds bank - Britain's biggest domestic bank - which announced a similar decision in October. 
Burdon, chief executive at climate finance campaign Make My Money Matter, said: ""it's another nail in the coffin for fossil fuel expansion, and a massive signal to other UK banks that the game is up on new oil and gas.""
It is not yet clear if this is the beginning of a trend across the sector, but it comes just months after the UK government announced a new round of licensing for oil and gas production in the North Sea.
HSBC has said it will continue to keep its investments already in oil and gas fields as it  ""recognises that fossil fuels, especially natural gas, have a role to play in the transition, even though that role will continue to diminish""."	/news/science-environment-63975173
politics	Boris Johnson: Former PM announces plans to stand at next election	"Boris Johnson has told his local Conservative Party he will stand again as an MP at the next general election, the BBC has been told.
Conservatives have given their MPs until 5 December to confirm whether they wish to contest the next election - which must be held by early 2025.
So far, 11 Tory MPs have announced they will not stand for re-election. 
re had been suggestions Mr Johnson would stand down from Parliament after he was ousted as prime minister.
MPs can still stand down before the next election without letting the party know ahead of time. 
In October, Mr Johnson ran to replace Liz Truss as prime minister and passed the threshold of 100 nominations from his parliamentary colleagues, only to withdraw from the race hours before the deadline.
Mr Johnson has been the MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip in west London since 2015. He was elected to the seat while still serving as mayor of London. 
xt election will be the fourth time he has run to represent the constituency. 
Mr Johnson has a 7,210 vote majority after securing a 1.8% swing to the Conservatives at the 2019 election. 
On 5 December, the Boundary Commission will end its consultation on new constituency boundaries for the next election. Conservative campaign headquarters has asked Tory MPs to confirm if they plan to stand for re-election before then.
Under current proposals, Mr Johnson could gain support when his constituency is redrawn to absorb some new Tory leaning areas.
Levelling Up minister Dehenna Davison, Chloe Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, and Will Wragg, the chair of the public administration select committee, have all said they will stand down.
Uxbridge and South Ruislip Conservative association said it ""fully supported Boris Johnson as our local MP and candidate at any future election"". 
Association chairman Richard Mills added: ""We look forward to continuing to work alongside him to deliver for the residents and communities within the constituency, where he has strong connections and involvement."""	/news/uk-politics-63824268
politics	Dave Bishop: Man behind Bus Pass Elvis political party dies	"A Nottingham political character, best known as Bus Pass Elvis, has died at the age of 78.
Dave Bishop, who also went by the name Lord Biro, first stood in the 1997 general election in Tatton, Cheshire, against the scandal-hit Neil Hamilton.
He stood for a number of parties, including Lord Biro Versus the Scallywag Tories, the Bus Pass Elvis Party and Militant Elvis Anti-HS2.
Friends and politicians have paid tribute to Mr Bishop.
gans of Mr Bishop - who stood in both local and national elections - included Ban Builders Bums, Bono for Pope and Make Clifton Great Again.
His profile grew in 2014, when he beat the Liberal Democrats in a Nottingham City Council by-election.
Friend and election partner Ian Pickering said: ""He was a member of the awkward squad.
""He said 'somebody has got to have a go at them'.
""But he loved it. He told me he didn't have holidays, instead he paid £500 to stand in an election.""
Despite his slightly outrageous image, Mr Pickering said his friend took his position seriously.
""He was very considered,"" Mr Pickering said. ""He was interviewed by BBC political reporter Chris Mason and he gave reasoned, clear answers.
""He was not 'in your face' and I think people appreciated that.""
Mr Bishop had been diagnosed with a brain tumour last month.
Mr Pickering said: ""I asked him if it had been a life well-lived. He said yes. 
""Can't really ask for more than that.""
Nadia Whittome, who represents Nottingham East for Labour, tweeted: ""I'm very sorry to hear of Dave's passing. 
""Many people in Nottingham have fond memories of him and will miss him greatly.""
Labour MP for Nottingham South Lilian Greenwood added: ""Always a pleasure to bump into Dave out on the campaign trail or around town. 
""Elections won't be the same without him.""

health	Gloucester Dementia Choir helps unlock memories and words	"A new choir for people with dementia aims to ""utilise the power of music"" to ease depression and anxiety amongst those suffering from the condition.
Gloucester Dementia Choir was launched on Saturday with a special Christmas session offering a safe environment for socialising, singing and celebrating music.
Jacqueline Fitall has dementia and said the first session was ""lovely"".
""I do forget things sometimes- but I absolutely love singing,"" she said.
""There are some really nice people here, and I have really enjoyed myself- it has been a nice experience,"" she added.
r was set up by the Gloucestershire Academy of Music which said it was building on the work it already performs in care homes across the county.
Jenny Harrison and Becky Chevis, from Gloucestershire, said they decided to launch the choir after they found a gap in music resources for those with dementia.
""Music evokes a lot of emotions, and it allows those living with the condition to reminisce,"" said Ms Harrison.
""When you play a song that they used to listen to forty years ago, they come to life, remember those words and find their voices to sing those words.
""Music is a really powerful tool for people with dementia and we want to utilise that.""
r is not only encouraging individuals with dementia to get involved, but also their families and carers too.
From 13 January the choir will begin offering sessions every two weeks.
Ms Chevis said she found the first session ""moving"".
""There was someone who sang a solo on the spot today - it nearly made me cry,"" she said.
""There is some amazing research about music and dementia- we know it can help ease depression and anxiety amongst those living with the condition.
""The first session has really proven that music can make people happy and provided that lovely feeling of being together with each other.
""It has been an absolute success and we look forward to the new year.""

technology	London homicides driven by drugs and social media, study finds	"Drugs, missed mental health sessions and social media usage are factors driving homicides, a study has found.
London Violence Reduction Unit's (VRU) report analysed police data to better understand the causes of murder and manslaughter.
Last year, there was a record number of teenage killings in the capital, despite a national Covid-19 lockdown.
Each homicide costs the police and criminal justice system an estimated £800,000, the report claims. 
London's homicide rate means it would have an annual cost of about £120m. 
Established by the London mayor's office, the VRU study by the behavioural insights team aimed to find a framework for experts, including the police, to deliver early and targeted interventions.
Following an analysis of 50 homicides, it found:
will now use the framework to analyse another 300 cases with a view to it potentially being used more routinely in the capital.
Met Police Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has previously said he wanted to bring the number of homicides in London down to below 100 a year, from 130. 
report from the Mayor's Violence Reduction Unit suggests police are only one part of the solution. 
re are recommendations for other agencies and policy makers too, including monitoring when someone stops engaging with mental health support and providing better guidance for young people who are being targeted on social media. 
report also highlights the gaps in the data recorded on homicides and makes recommendations for the police on how that can be improved. 
Gang violence, for example, is an area where researchers say there's not enough specific information about how drugs or social media are involved, or the relationships or nature of the conflict. 
Researchers say the clues are often there, but improving the data will make it easier to spot patterns and see where current provision and policy need to be improved.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""If we are to continue reducing violence in London, it's crucial that we identify more opportunities to intervene early because I firmly believe that violence is preventable, not inevitable.""
Lib Peck, director of VRU, said: ""The foundation of the VRU's approach to tackling violence is to build an evidence base for what works and what doesn't.""

sports	Senegalese athletes angered by World Cup bonuses	"The decision by President Macky Sall to pay Senegal's football squad its World Cup bonus despite the team not hitting its target has caused anger for some in the West African nation. 
African champions had been tasked with reaching the quarter-finals but bowed out in the second round after a 3-0 defeat by England. 
""We will fully pay the qualification bonuses for the quarter-finals for the whole official delegation,"" Sall announced two days later.
World Cup bonuses - which come out of the pool of nearly $23m (£19m) unlocked by the Senegalese government to cover the World Cup costs - will differ depending on the involvement of the 26 players in the entire campaign, including qualifying. 
However, some former players and other Senegalese sportsmen have questioned the move. 
""If you win you must be rewarded, but if you lose you must learn from it,"" former Teranga Lions forward Diomansy Kamara told local newspaper Stades. 
Despite its generous nature, Sall's decision was even less favourably received by athletes from other sports who traditionally have to fight to fund their own participation in competitions. 
Hamadel Ndiaye is a Senegalese triathlon champion trying to reach the world series and qualify for the Olympics but despite working as a cameraman in London to help with costs, he has often been unable to afford flights that would have enabled him to compete. 
He admits to feeling put out when learning that supporters would have free passage to watch the Teranga Lions in Qatar. 
""Firstly, I was disturbed when I heard the story about the nice amount of money unlocked to bring fans to Qatar,"" the former swimmer, 26, told BBC Sport Africa.
""In both 2019 and 2021, I wanted to participate in a race but the flight ticket to Dakar was $850 (£705) and I needed to pay another $120 (£100) for my bicycle as extra luggage but I couldn't afford this.
""Sometimes we have to wait until the last minute to know if we can participate or not."" 
Ndiaye's viewpoint is backed by up athlete Sangone Kandji, who represents Senegal in the triple jump and says such situations are happening far too often, preventing athletes from ""acclimatising"" at event venues and thus affecting results. 
""This year, at the Islamic Solidarity Games, we arrived late in Konya and one of the athletes landed the day before his race. Those things need to be reviewed so that we can help the athlete to recover (from their trips).""
After her triple jump title at June's African Athletics Championships in Mauritius, Kandji adds she was rewarded with a ""modest sum"".
Olympian Ndeye Binta Ndiongue is a Senegalese fencer also fighting to earn a living, and who was only paid last year for results-related bonuses dating back over a decade to 2008. 
""This year, I won the bronze medal at the African championship and the bonuses are yet to come my way,"" she told BBC Sport Africa. 
""(The funds for football) bring frustration even if I understand that it brings sponsors and excitement to the whole country."" 
According to Ndiongue, a Senegalese gold medal holder in fencing is awarded roughly $650 (£539)after a continental title, a sum likely to be dwarfed by that received by the footballers.
In addition to frustration over the bonuses awarded to the Teranga Lions, these other athletes are also constantly troubled by the attention lavished on football in comparison to other sports. 
""Football is the priority and everybody knows it - all the African federations suffer from this,"" insists Diongue.
Last December, Guy Marius Sagna, one of the opposition leaders, backed the various athletes when the sports minister's budget was voted on at Senegal's National Assembly.
""This is a long, ongoing debate - is he the sports minister or the football minister?"" Sagna poignantly asked.
""Sports like karate or taekwondo brought world medals. Football has never brought world medals, but the way football is taken care of has no comparison whatsoever with karate or taekwondo.""
""If I am not wrong, the budget of the Senegalese Athletics Federation is around $50,000 (£41,000). For the football Lions, the budget for one single friendly game is between $485,000-$810,000 (£398,000-£672,000),"" Sagna added.
In response, Sports Minister Yakhouba Diattara promised ""there is no sport we will not support"".
""I think the solution is to have a meeting every year between the Olympic National Committee, the government and the different federations to arbitrate,"" he continued.
""The sports that we believe have a chance of winning medals will receive funds. The others will have to wait.""
As she continues a life where funds are in short supply, Diongue focuses on her own training plan while teaching fencing to children in the French town of Asnieres-sur-Seine. 
""My coach accepts me for free because he understands I can't pay 2,000-4,000 euros (£1,763-£3,526,$2,125-4,250) a year,"" she explained. ""Before the 2020 Olympics, I had three jobs but ended up with burnout and almost gave up.
""Thankfully, I had my family, friends and coaches to help me and I also received donations - I managed to get 3,000 euros (£2,650, $3,200) in total.""
When she finally received her bonuses after her participation in her first Olympics, it was mainly to cover her debts.
As Senegalese authorities prepare to host the 2026 Youth Olympics, the first Olympic event in Africa, new infrastructure is being built or renovated in and around the capital Dakar. 
During the last Games in Tokyo, nine athletes represented Senegal, but the nation's only Olympic medal remains the silver won by 400m hurdler Amadou Dia Ba in Seoul in 1988.
Once again, what could appear a solid investment for the future continues to cause angst among some of the athletes hoping to shine for Senegal in future senior Olympics. 
""There were a lot of investments made with the stadium or Dakar Arena, yet these are not used most of the time during the year,"" Hamadel Ndiaye points out. 
""The equipment in the gym there is barely used and I think it's a shame because it would be easy to gather a national team and organise training camps."""	/sport/africa/63994617

politics	Stephen Flynn: Who is the new SNP Westminster leader?	"Aberdeen South MP Stephen Flynn is set to face his first Prime Minister's Questions less than 24 hours after being elected the SNP's new Westminster leader.
Here is what we know about the 34-year-old and what colleagues expect of him.
Mr Flynn was born in Dundee and raised in the city and in nearby Brechin.
He studied politics at Dundee University before moving to Aberdeen - although he still travels back down the A90 to support Dundee United.
His hip gave way when he was a teenager, and he spent 17 years in ""constant pain"" and facing a ""daily physical and mental battle"" until eventually having replacement surgery in September 2020.
After marrying his wife in 2014, he was elected to Aberdeen City Council in a by-election the following year, and served as the SNP's group leader from 2016 until he became an MP in 2019.
He took Aberdeen South from the Conservatives - a seat which has bounced between Labour, the SNP and Tories at the last four elections.
Following his election as Westminster leader, Nicola Sturgeon congratulated both Flynn and Paisley and Renfrewshire South MP Mhairi Black, who was elected deputy leader, calling them a ""truly formidable team"".
SNP MP Stewart Hosie echoed that sentiment, telling the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""One thing you will see from Stephen is a different tone - perhaps more pointed, snappier, more vibrant. 
""I think he will bring a great deal to the table and a great deal to the independence cause as he holds the government to account.
""Stephen has rare gift of being able to communicate difficult things in a really effective way and I'm looking forward to seeing him deploy that particularly in PMQs today.""
Stephen Flynn says he will push the impact of the cost of living and Scotland's right to choose its future
Mr Flynn's maiden speech in the Commons underlines why colleagues hope he will be a punchy presence as leader.
He warned Conservative members that ""we will not forget, and we will not forgive this government"".
He added: ""Scotland rejects your austerity and Scotland rejects your Brexit, just as Scotland rejected your prime minister.""
Mr Flynn became a prominent member of the so-called Tuesday Club of male SNP MPs who regularly meet for five-a-side football, beer and curry nights.
gas industry is at the heart of his patch, and he initially argued against the idea of a windfall tax on the profits of big energy firms - something later embraced enthusiastically by the SNP.
In February, he told MPs: ""The last time the UK government implemented a windfall tax, investment in the North Sea oil and gas sector plummeted. 
""It fell off a cliff - in fact it has never got back to where it was. If that happens again, my constituents will lose their jobs.""
Mr Flynn has been linked to the leadership role for some time, with newspaper reports claiming he was set to oust Ian Blackford surfacing weeks before the Skye MP decided not to stand again.
However, SNP leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that the change is ""not a coup"". "	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63886702

business	Jack Dorsey: Twitter co-founder breaks silence on Elon Musk takeover	"witter co-founder and ex-CEO Jack Dorsey has addressed the mass sackings at his former firm, apologising for growing Twitter ""too quickly"".
Half of the social media giant's staff are being fired, a week after Elon Musk bought it in a $44bn deal.
Billionaire Mr Musk has said he had ""no choice"" but to slash the company's workforce as the firm is losing more than $4m (£3.5m) a day.
witter staff took to the platform to express their anger at the firings. 
In a statement posted on the microblogging site, Mr Dorsey - who quit as CEO in November and left the board of directors in May - said Twitter staff ""are strong and resilient. They will always find a way no matter how difficult the moment. I realise many are angry with me. I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly. I apologise for that.""
""I am grateful for, and love, everyone who has ever worked on Twitter. I don't expect that to be mutual in this moment...or ever…and I understand,"" he added. 
His statement appeared to endorse the need for dismissals at the firm. The 45-year-old Mr Dorsey has been supportive of Mr Musk's takeover.
Back in April when Mr Musk first began his purchase of Twitter, Mr Dorsey said the 51-year-old was the ""singular solution I trust"" and that the South African's takeover was ""the right path...I believe it with all my heart"".
Mr Dorsey created Twitter in 2006 along with Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass. He sent the company's first Tweet, writing ""just setting up my twttr"". 
uts have come across Twitter's 7,500-strong work force, and there are fears it could damage the firm's content moderation efforts. 
Despite the dismissals Mr Musk has said the firm's policies remain ""absolutely unchanged"".
A host of major brands have halted advertising spending with Twitter in recent days, including Volkswagen, General Motors and Pfizer.
Almost all of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising, and Mr Musk has been looking for ways to cut costs and make money in different ways from the platform.
In a move much publicised in advance, Twitter launched a subscription service on Saturday allowing users to buy blue-tick verification on the platform for a monthly fee of $7.99 (£7)."	/news/technology-63527893
health	Cleidocranial dysplasia: The mum and son with a one-in-a-million condition	"""I don't have collarbones, so I can touch my shoulders together under my chin,"" says Karen Hunt.
""It's a party trick. There have to be some perks to my condition.""
Karen, 40, and her four-year-old son Jaiden have cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), a rare genetic condition that can affect teeth and bones.
People with CCD might have bones that form differently or are more fragile than normal, and certain ones like collarbones may be absent altogether.
After decades of obscurity, CCD is now gaining more public recognition, thanks to the Stranger Things star, Gaten Matarazzo, who has the condition.
It can be passed from a parent to a child, or can appear at random.
In Karen's case, her baby teeth were removed because they would not fall out naturally.
Her second teeth then struggled to come through and further surgery was needed to make that happen.
use people to look different, and Karen says she was bullied at secondary school because of this.
""It was awful,"" she said.
""People would ask 'what's wrong with your face? Why don't you have any teeth?'
""As an adult, I can answer those questions, and I want people to ask them. Knowledge is key to understanding difference,"" she added.
""That's what I want for my son. I want him to see me be confident about it and to embrace our unique look.""
Orthodontic surgery to bring her adult teeth through was so painful, Karen says, that she stopped midway, and now has gaps in her top teeth.
""I remember saying to the orthodontist, will I still look different if I have the work done?
""He told me I would, so I felt at the time it wasn't worth going through the pain.""
For her son Jaiden, CCD has had an even more serious effect. The enamel on his teeth is very thin, and all but four of his baby teeth have worn away or have had to be removed.
But Karen is hopeful that Jaiden's experience of life with the condition will be better than her own.
""I didn't have anyone to reach out to and I didn't know anyone else with the condition.
""My son has me, and I have experienced most of what he'll go through.
""We have this incredible nationwide network of people with CCD in the UK and we all support each other.
""The procedures Jaiden will have to go through are different these days, and hopefully he'll end up with a good set of teeth at the end of it.""
Around one in a million people has CCD, meaning it has received little attention historically. This is now starting to change.
Gaten Matarazzo, who stars as Dustin in the Netflix series Stranger Things, has been vocal in raising the profile of the condition.
He sent a message to a recent conference in the UK for people with CCD.
""Loving yourself isn't showing the parts of yourself you're confident in. It's showing off the parts of yourself that you're least confident in, in spite of your fear.""
w Karen views it, too.
She teaches her son to be happy and confident.
""He just gets on with it,"" she said.

It is understood the service is likely to apply to homes which have smart meters installed.
re are hopes it can be put in place this winter, when energy bills rise.
""We are developing a new service that will be available for consumers to benefit from across this winter and will be announcing further information soon,"" a spokesman for National Grid ESO - which will run the scheme - said.
It is understood the company's proposals of how it will work, such as how money will be paid back to customers, are expected to be revealed in the next fortnight, with consultations taking place with energy providers and the UK's energy regulator Ofgem.
It has been reported that rebates for minimising the use of goods such as tumble dryers, dishwashers and games consoles during the peak hours of 17:00 and 20:00 could be as high as £6 per kWh saved.
National Grid ESO previously told the BBC the service is ""not about energy rationing"", despite fears over supplies, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine affecting oil and gas supplies to Europe.

Jack Beckwith, 25 and from County Durham, said the scheme would mean he is able to put his heating on this winter. 
He expects his bill to go up to £238 per month in October - from his current monthly average of £100 - wiping out his savings. 
""I generally keep on top of my usage and pay for what I use. I have some savings - but that was meant for emergencies - my leaky roof fund. That'll all go towards paying for the price increase,"" he told the BBC. 
""It's been a gradual realisation that I can't afford it.""
Jack said he was expecting to not meet up with friends, and has already said no to taking on a gym membership. He is also considering cutting back on his Spotify subscription, which could save around £10 per month.
""Off peak heating will be a lifeline,"" he said. ""It will literally will save lives if people can be made aware of it, and can use it, because it will mean they can put the heating on.""
National Grid ESO has hosted webinars with energy firms to ask for feedback on its proposals.
move follows a trial where Octopus Energy offered incentives for 100,000 customers who reduced consumption.
Octopus Energy has said during the trial its consumers received credit on their energy accounts and also had a ""self-refund option"" where they could get cash transferred to their bank accounts.

entertainment	The Big Eurovision Party: Rylan to bring in 2023 with song contest stars	"What do you get when you put 15 Eurovision winners on one stage? A great big party, that's what.
Six months before Liverpool hosts the song contest on behalf of Ukraine, about 15,000 fans travelled to Amsterdam's Ziggo Dome to see acts from competitions gone by perform.
As part of its New Year's Eve line-up, BBC One is showing Het Grote Songfestivalfeest - renamed The Big Eurovision Party for UK viewers and hosted by Rylan.
Granted, some songs have stood the test of time more than others, but Loreen's 2012 hit Euphoria had the crowd bouncing 10 years later.
""It was needed then, and it's needed now,"" she tells BBC News backstage at the concert.
""Euphoria has some sort of deepness to it that touches people on a real level,"" she says. ""Some songs just connect.""
39-year-old is often credited with changing the direction of Eurovision after her success, and she's hoping to represent Sweden again in 2023.
Eurovision-related events outside of May, when the contest is held, was something Israel's winner Netta had no idea about when she competed four years ago. 
""There wasn't any career before that. I was singing in bars and just trying to make a living in a very modest way, trying to sing back-up, singing covers at weddings,"" she tells BBC News. 
""I went from anonymity to stardom, and everything changed for a girl who'd calculate the amount of money - 'What do I buy, milk or beer?' - to people from Amsterdam calling me saying, 'We want to fly you here, how many people do you need?'.""  
She admits, though, it's ""a challenge"" to get fans to appreciate her non-Eurovision material, but says she's working in America with music producers to try to change that. 
Other performers agree that it can be strangely tricky, after performing in front of 160 million viewers, to get people around the world to listen to future releases.
But in recent years, acts like Måneskin, Rosa Linn and Duncan Laurence have all managed to have huge success in the US, largely down to TikTok.
""To me it was always a dream to be known as a musician on a global scale,"" Dutch singer Laurence explains. ""The biggest moment was when we hit the one billion streams on all platforms, and I got this award on stage in Rotterdam at Eurovision that I brought to The Netherlands.""
""You have to explain it's not X Factor, it's not The Voice, it's way bigger. Once it's in their head, they're like: 'I want to watch this'.""
28-year-old says American audiences see him as a new singer-songwriter, who are largely unaware of the world's largest live music event, but he's proud to be part of the three acts ""finally"" getting Eurovision songs to chart in America.
As well as Loreen, Netta and Laurence, the Netherlands gig allowed fans to see two winning Ukrainian acts, including this year's Kalush Orchestra.
rowd roared every time an act shouted ""Slava Ukraini"" (glory to Ukraine).
Jamala, who won in 2016 for her song about the 1944 deportation of Crimean Tatars, was dressed in the country's flag of yellow and blue for her performance.
""I know there are many people here tonight with light in their heart,"" she said on stage. 
""Please share it with my country and stand with Ukraine.""
Standing with Eurovision fans is something Ireland's Johnny Logan will always do, telling the crowd: ""Thank you for my life"".
""The people out there that love Eurovision opened up the whole world to me,"" the 68-year-old tells BBC News. 
""These days I sell out everywhere I work. A lot of people have to ask the question, 'If he's still around, why?' - and I can still deliver.
""When you stand up in the middle of this, I'm very humbled when I step back from the microphone and let the crowd take over the chorus"".
Like Loreen, Logan is a Eurovision legend - and not just with fans, with fellow winners too. 
Alexander Rybak, 2009's winner for Norway, interrupts our interview to say goodbye to Logan. 
""I just had to hug,"" he says. ""Johnny Logan is not just my favourite Eurovision singer, but my favourite heart-warming singer. He has heart. 
""A lot of artists use music to promote their talent but Johnny uses his talent to promote music.""
Planning for next year's competition in Liverpool is already under way, but it'll be a while yet before it's known which act will be representing the United Kingdom. 
Sam Ryder, after his success in 2022, has already ruled himself out. He became one of the UK's best ambassadors for the competition in Turin, constantly talking about the love and togetherness it brings.
Loreen ends the night by agreeing with the Space Man singer, telling the BBC: ""It has opened up my career and I've met so many wonderful people.
""I have been able to do what I love the most, and it's thanks to Eurovision."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63677509

entertainment	Nativity: Peruzzi artwork acquired by National Museums NI	"An ""exceptionally rare"" 16th Century depiction of the nativity acquired by National Museums NI will go on public display in Northern Ireland next year.
Painted by Baldassare Tommaso Peruzzi around 1515, The Nativity is one of the artist's last remaining works.
It will go on display at the Ulster Museum in 2023.
Arts and Heritage Minister Lord Parkinson described its acquisition as a ""Christmas gift to the nation"".
Last year the painting was made subject to a temporary export bar in a bid to keep it in the UK.
""For many, being part of a nativity play is one of the first ways that we learn the story of Christmas,"" Lord Parkinson said.
""That is why I am delighted that, this Christmas Eve, we can announce that this incredible painting of that famous event has been saved for the nation thanks to the export bar system.""
Born in 1481 near Siena, Peruzzi was one of the leading artistic figures in Rome during the High Renaissance, working alongside Raphael and Bramante.
A painter, draughtsman and architect, the majority of his artworks were in fresco and have been lost to history.
Senior curator of art at National Museums NI Anne Stewart said she was delighted to have acquired ""this remarkable painting"".
""Currently, there are no High Renaissance paintings in any public collection in Northern Ireland, so this is truly a Christmas gift to our audiences,"" she added.
National Heritage Memorial Fund, Art Fund, Stormont's Department for Communities and the Esme Mitchell Trust have supported National Museums NI in its fundraising to acquire The Nativity.

politics	Rishi Sunak speaks of safety fears for daughter	"Rishi Sunak has spoken of his fears for his daughter's safety on her walk to school following a number of crimes against women and girls. 
PM said ""events of the last year showed us that so many women and girls have not felt as safe as they should."" 
He mentioned the case of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel shot in her home earlier this year in Liverpool.
""I want to make sure that my kids and everyone else can walk around safely,"" the PM said. 
He said in the past he and ""many of us men"" had taken safety ""for granted"".
""So tackling that and making it safer for people is something that's just personally quite important to me."" 
rime minister said his eldest child had wanted to walk to her primary school by herself when she turned 11, adding this had been the reason why his family had previously moved out of their Downing Street flat and closer to her school before he resigned as chancellor.
He said: ""It brings it home to you as a parent and again over the summer the awful things that we read about with the young girl Olivia [Pratt-Korbel], which we'll all remember.
""I want to make sure that my kids and everyone else can walk around safely.
""That's what any parent wants for their children.""
On tackling crime, he said people in disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to be affected by crime and he wanted to ""deliver for those people"" by putting more police officers on the street.
In 2019 the government pledged to recruit 20,000 additional police officers in England and Wales by March 2023, in an attempt to reverse cuts since 2010, which had seen the number fall by about 19,000.
Labour has accused the government of ""taking an axe to the vital services that are there to protect us all"".
Pushed on whether the number of people in prison should be higher, Mr Sunak said this was a ""logical consequence of catching more criminals"" and the government was building 10,000 more prison places over the next few years. 
He said he was not particularly comfortable with prison numbers going up, but the funding was in place to have the capacity to do it.
Mr Sunak was speaking to reporters while flying to Bali last Sunday, for his first G20 summit since becoming prime minister.
Asked about life back in Downing Street, he said moving back into the flat the family lived in  when he was chancellor above No 10 had made the transition ""easier than it otherwise might have been""."	/news/uk-politics-63676396
business	Union rejects Rolls-Royce £2,000 living-cost bonus	"A union representing Rolls-Royce workers has rejected the offer of a £2,000 one-off payment from the firm to help its staff with the rising cost of living.
Of the 14,000 staff at Rolls-Royce who were eligible for the payment, 11,000 members are unionised.
Unite said the offer ""falls far short of the real cost of living challenges which our members are experiencing"". 
But Rolls-Royce said the offer was ""fair"" and ""a good deal"" for staff.
ump sum, which was intended for junior management and shop floor staff, was due to begin being rolled out in August, starting with the 3,000 non-unionised staff before being paid to the remaining 11,000 unionised workers.
Unite's regional secretary Paresh Patel said the union was still in negotiations with Rolls-Royce about the pay offer.
News of the offer emerged on Monday night, and was later confirmed by Rolls-Royce.
However, Unite said: ""The fact that Rolls-Royce has made this announcement in the way that it has certainly in our view undermines the trade union and the negotiating position that should be between the employer and the unions on this matter.""
Rolls-Royce had also offered workers a 4% increase in pay, back-dated to March. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson had told the BBC it would be ""the highest annual pay rise for at least a decade"" for its shop floor staff. 
But Unite said it would also reject that offer of a 4% pay rise.
re are ongoing discussions with unions about a pay settlement for 2022-2023, Rolls-Royce's spokesperson said, and the cost of living issue is to be a factor in those negotiations.
In response to Unite's rejection of the offer, the spokesperson said: ""This is a good deal for our colleagues that is fair and competitive, with an immediate cash lump sum to help them through the current exceptional economic climate. 
""We will continue to talk to our people.""
Meanwhile, around 115,000 Royal Mail workers are voting on strike action in a similar row over pay.
Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents many Royal Mail staff, said it would be claiming for an ""inflation-based, no-strings pay award"", adding that Royal Mail's offer of a 2% pay award was ""miles away from where inflation is, totally inadequate"". 
Pay rates and measures to help UK staff have been increasing as businesses have been seeking to recruit and retain staff, after official figures showed there were fewer unemployed people than job vacancies for the first time since records began. 
Earlier this month, Lloyds Bank staff were offered a £1,000 lump sum to help with rising costs, after Unite the Union demonstrated outside its annual general meeting.
Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - currently stands at 9%, and is expected to increase again later this year.
It seems one-off cost of living payments are gaining in popularity among employers - but are they a short-term fix to a long-term issue?
ure of inflation means that while the rate of price rises may slow next year, it is extremely unlikely that the cost of living will actually drop. Prices are almost certainly not going to fall.
Yet, these payments are not embedded in future wages, unlike a regular pay increase. As employees continue to find it tough, will there be pressure on bosses to make these payments a permanent part of pay next year and beyond?
re is undoubtedly an awareness among businesses that workers, particularly the lower-paid, need more financial help at the moment to cover their bills.
But perhaps this eye-catching tactic of one-off payments is directed more at another issue - the retention and recruitment of staff.
Rolls-Royce was badly impacted by the global coronavirus pandemic, which hit demand for its aircraft engines as international air travel ground to a halt. 
In 2020 it announced plans to cut its global workforce by 9,000 by the end of this year, with 3,000 of those jobs going in the UK. At the time it said it would take ""several years"" for the industry to recover from the pandemic. 
In the first year of Covid, Rolls-Royce made a loss of £4bn because of the collapse in air travel, however it returned to profit in 2021.
Staff shortages are also putting pressure on firms to raise wages.
Earlier this month, Morrisons said it would increase pay for its store workers as UK supermarkets battle for staff in the face of increasing competition in the sector.
Rival chains Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda have also announced pay rises for their workers this year."	/news/business-61874786

entertainment	Wilko Johnson: Dr Feelgood guitarist dies, aged 75	"Wilko Johnson, whose machine-gun guitar style and manic stage presence was a major influence on punk, has died.
musician found fame with the 1970s pub-rock band Dr Feelgood, and later played with Ian Dury before embarking on a four-decade solo career.
He also starred in two series of Game Of Thrones as the mute executioner Ser Ilyn Payne.
rs ago he survived what was initially diagnosed as a terminal case of pancreatic cancer.
musician refused chemotherapy to embark on a farewell tour.
""The decision was quite easy - chemotherapy could do no more than extend my life for a relatively short period and I thought I'd just rather enjoy the health that was left to me,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.
However, later tests discovered that the guitarist's pancreatic cancer was in fact a rare and less aggressive neuroendocrine tumour.
He underwent a radical, 11-hour operation that removed his pancreas, spleen and parts of his stomach and intestines, and was declared cancer-free in 2014.
""Now, I'm spending my time gradually coming to terms with the idea that my death is not imminent, that I am going to live on,"" he said at that year's Q awards.
""If there's a moral to this story, it's that you never know what's going to happen"", Wilko Johnson told the audience at the Q Awards in London
musician continued to play live until last month, hosting his final gig at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire on 18 October.
Johnson's death was confirmed to the BBC by his representatives.
In a statement posted on social media, they added: ""This is the announcement we never wanted to make, and we do so, on behalf of Wilko's family and the band, with a very heavy heart.
""Wilko Johnson has died. He passed away at home on Monday evening, 21 November 2022.
""Thank you for respecting Wilko's family's privacy at this very sad time, and thank you all for having been such a tremendous support throughout Wilko's incredible life.""
Who's Roger Daltrey, who recorded a top three album with Johnson in 2014, said his friend's music would ""live on"".
""More than anything Wilko wanted to be a poet,"" he said in a statement. ""I was lucky to have known him and have him as a friend. His music lives on but there's no escaping the final curtain this time.""
Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page tweeted that he was ""sad to hear of the passing of Wilko Johnson"", recalling how the atmosphere was ""electric"" when he saw the late guitarist perform in Camden in 2013.
Born in Canvey Island, Essex, Johnson developed a distinctive, finger-picked style that blended percussive stabs and fluid licks, allowing him to play lead and rhythm guitar at the same time.
""It's a bit like riding a bike,"" he told Radio 4 in 2013. ""It's easy to do but difficult to describe"".
He perfected the style with Dr Feelgood, where his intense and unhinged stage persona gave the band a menacing energy. 
Johnson recorded three studio albums with the band but, fittingly, it was the live record Stupidity that became their only number one.
Steve Howley, of Classic Rock magazine, once said Johnson's confrontational style led directly to punk, calling him ""one of the quintessential English guitar heroes.""
""Wilko may not be as famous as some other guitarists, but he's right up there,"" agreed Paul Weller in an interview with Uncut magazine. 
""There are a lot of people who'll say the same. I can hear Wilko in lots of places. It's some legacy.""
Arguments with Dr Feelgood's lead singer Lee Brilleaux led to Johnson's departure in 1977. He formed a short-lived band called Solid Senders, who released on album on Virgin Records, before Johnson joined Ian Dury's backing group The Blockheads.
After Dury's drug problems prompted the dissolution of that group, the guitarist set out on a solo career, with albums including Ice On The Motorway, Call It What You Want and Barbed Wire Blues - which introduced his regular backing group The Wilko Johnson Band.
ured relentlessly, receiving a fresh wave of interest in the 21st Century thanks to Julien Temple's Oil City Confidential, a Dr Feelgood documentary that presented Johnson as a loveable, loopy, quintessentially British guitar god.
On the back of the film's success, two volumes of The Best of Wilko Johnson were released in 2010, and the musician started writing his autobiography, Looking Back on Me, where he detailed his love of astronomy - going so far as to build his own observatory in Southend.
""I really would like to go into the galaxies, to be in the intergalactic void,"" he wrote.
After recovering from cancer, he continued to play and record, supporting Status Quo on their 2014 tour and releasing his last album, Blow Your Mind in 2018.
News of his death was greeted with sadness on Twitter, with musicians including Blur's Graham Coxon, Blondie's Clem Burke and The Charlatans' Tim Burgess paying tribute.
""Very sad to hear Wilko Johnson has died,"" wrote Alex Kapranos of the indie band Franz Ferdinand. 
""His unique, wired playing and stage presence thrilled and inspired many guitarists, myself included. His presence will be felt for many more years.""

technology	Damaged cable leaves Shetland cut off from mainland	"Communications to Shetland have been severely disrupted after a subsea cable was damaged.
Police have declared a major incident after the south subsea cable between the islands and the mainland was cut.
force said some landlines and mobiles were not usable and that officers were patrolling to try to reassure residents.
Repairs to another cable connecting Shetland and Faroe are ongoing after it was damaged last week. 
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was an emergency situation for the island.
Scottish government's resilience committee had met and was working with partner agencies to ensure support was provided, she added.
She said the assumption was the damage was accidental, adding: ""There is nothing to suggest otherwise, but work is continuing to assess exactly what the cause of the problem has been.""
MP for Orkney and Shetlands Alastair Carmichael told the BBC he had raised the issue with the UK government, but understood it could be days before communications were restored.
He said the priority was fixing the issue but that resilience would also need to be looked at in future.
Homes and businesses are affected across the isles, which are 130 miles (210 km) from the Scottish mainland and have a population of about 23,000.
BBC has heard reports that many shops are unable to take card payments.
Meanwhile Highlands and Islands Airports told the BBC that Sumburgh Airport was ""operating as normal"", but would advise passengers to contact Loganair for further updates.
Serco NorthLink Ferries confirmed they did not anticipate the problem would have any impact on sailings.
A BT Group spokesperson said: ""Due to a break in a third-party subsea cable connecting Shetland with the Scottish mainland, some phone, broadband and mobile services are affected.
""Engineers are working to divert services via other routes as soon as possible and we'll provide further updates. Our external subsea provider is also looking to restore their link quickly. 
""Anyone who needs to call 999 should try their landline or their mobile, even if they don't have signal from their own mobile provider. We're sorry for any inconvenience.""
Emergency services have had to implement temporary back-up arrangements.
Police Scotland said it was working with partners including the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and HM Coastguard to bring additional emergency support to the island.
force said an emergency hub had been set up in the Tesco car park in South Road, Lerwick.
Ch Insp Jane Mackenzie told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that police officers would be more visible on the island in the meantime.
She said: ""We're still trying to work to establish the full extent of the problem - we know there are some telephone lines working, 999 lines are believed to be working and some mobile networks are still working.
""So anyone calling 999 should be able to do so from a mobile phone. What we would ask is if you have an emergency you should first try a landline or mobile to call 999. 
""If that doesn't work, you should flag down an emergency service vehicle that isn't using their blue light or attend either a police station, hospital, fire or ambulance station to report the emergency.""
Ch Insp Mackenzie urged the public not to use phone lines for non-urgent calls and to check on elderly or vulnerable people more frequently as assistance alarms may not be operating effectively.
was damaged between Faroe and Shetland last week will be repaired on Saturday, according to Faroese Telecom's head of infrastructure Páll Vesturbú.
He said: ""The damage is affecting most of telecom services to Shetland. There are some services still working but we will try to establish more services during the day if that's possible. 
""We expect it will be fishing vessels that damaged the cable but it is very rare that we have two problems at the same time.""
MP Alistair Carmichael added that the damage had caused ""catastrophic impact"".
He said: ""Communication is critical to modern life, to business, to the emergency services and education - just about every aspect of modern life. 
""It's like somebody has flipped a switch and taken us back 20 or 30 years. You live in an island community, you know sometimes these things happen and that's why we have to learn the lessons from this.""
Modern submarine cables use fibre optic technology and are typically as wide as a garden hose, according to telecoms market research firm TeleGeography.
It explains lasers on one end fire at extremely rapid rates down thin glass fibres to receptors at the other end of the cable. 
glass fibres are wrapped in layers of plastic - and sometimes steel wire - for protection. 
Cables lie on the ocean floor, while nearer to the shore they are buried under the seabed for additional protection.
firm said ""considerable care"" is taken to make sure cables avoid fault zones, fishing zones, anchoring areas and other dangers.
Ian Brown, a partner with Lerwick-based internet provider Shetland Broadband, said he became aware of a problem just after 00:00 on Thursday when his home broadband went off.
He said the north cable was broken on 15 October in a clean break, but the southern one was not a clean break because there are around 100 fibres in the cable - and not all had been broken. 
Shetland Broadband is still operational because the fibres it uses were not damaged.
Mr Brown said the impact ranged from minor inconvenience for islanders to disruption to businesses and local NHS services that rely on their online connection.
He said Shetland Broadband was working with the NHS to try and resolve its issues.
In another example, he said a delivery of 2,000 parcels to the islands encountered problems as they could not be scanned.
Mr Brown said: ""We don't know if the cable was hooked up by a ship or lifted and caught by the currents. It is a very rare event, a bit like storm damage."""	/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-63326102
technology	Guardian newspaper hit by suspected ransomware attack	"Guardian newspaper has come under a suspected ransomware attack.
It said there had been a ""serious incident"" affecting its IT systems in the last 24 hours, with disruption to ""behind the scenes services"".
mpany said it was continuing to publish globally to its website - one of the most visited news sites in the world - and was ""confident"" it could still print the physical paper.
Staff have been told not to go into the office and to work from home.
In a statement, the Guardian said: ""Our technology teams have been working to deal with all aspects of this incident, with the vast majority of our staff able to work from home as we did during the pandemic.
""We believe this to be a ransomware attack, but are continuing to consider all possibilities.""
Ransomware is malicious software used by hackers - and often sent via attachments in emails - to gain access to an organisation's or individual's computer systems.
riminals then find and encrypt important or sensitive files - and demand a ransom for them to be unlocked.
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
A huge range of targets - from schools and hospitals to government agencies and media organisations - have fallen victim to ransomware, with research indicating hackers are paid in the majority of cases, especially in the UK.
According to the Press Gazette, the Guardian is the ninth most-read news site in the world, with almost 390 million visits in November.
In its own reporting of the incident, the Guardian said online publishing was ""largely unaffected"".
It said Guardian Media Group chief executive Anna Bateson and editor-in-chief Katharine Viner had sent a message to the company's workforce.
""Thank you to everyone working hard throughout this incident to keep us publishing,"" they said.
""We will continue to keep our staff and anyone else affected informed. 
""With a few key exceptions, we would like everyone to work from home for the remainder of the week unless we notify you otherwise.""
Jake Moore, global cyber-security adviser at security software company ESET, said the Guardian being targeted was not a surprise.
""News organisations have become a regular target for cyber-attacks this year, and these attacks often have even more damaging effects on the companies targeted,"" he said.
""Ransomware can often bring all departments to a standstill, so it is fortunate that despite this attack the organisation will still see some key areas working as usual."" "	/news/technology-64056300
business	Energy companies' customer service hits record low	"Customer service standards at energy companies have fallen to a record low as households are being hit by soaring bills, Citizens Advice has said.
Standards have ""plummeted"" since June 2021 when several suppliers went bust due to high global gas prices, it said.
rage waiting time on the phone to speak to a firm is now about six and a half minutes, compared to just under four minutes the year before.
Citizens Advice called for improvements before bills rise again in the autumn.
rgy price cap, which limits how much suppliers can raise the cost of household bills, went up by an unprecedented £700 a year to £1,971 in April for the typical household. Bills are expected to rise by a further £800 a year in October.
rise in bills is down to wholesale gas prices soaring in recent months. Demand increased as economies reopened following Covid restrictions, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has fuelled fears over supplies, pushing prices up further. 
rease in the wholesale cost of gas - the price at which energy companies buy it - caught many suppliers out and meant they were losing money on price promises to customers. This led to several, mostly smaller, firms going bust and millions of customers being shifted to new suppliers.
Between January and March 2022, Citizens Advice said its consumer service helpline saw more than 70,000 cases related to energy issues - a 63% increase on the same period the previous year.
rity said it was ""particularly worried"" about people on prepayment meters, who it said are at risk of having no gas or electricity if they can't afford to top up.
It warned that ""without swift action"" to tackle poor customer service, standards ""will only worsen when bills are expected to hike again this winter"".
Energy suppliers are obliged to help people who cannot afford their bills.
""At a time when customers need all the support they can get, it's worrying to see service performance is the worst on record,"" said Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice.
""This leaves people frustrated and in the dark at the end of the phone.
""We recognise call centre staff are working incredibly hard to answer as many calls as possible, but energy companies must do better.""
Citizens Advice said companies were also getting slightly slower to respond to emails. On average, suppliers responded to 62% of emails within two working days, compared with 66% during the same period in 2021. 
rity ranked energy suppliers through its ""star rating"" after looking at information from a number of sources, including its complaints to its consumer service and the energy ombudsman.
It ranked Utilita, Ovo Energy, Ecotricity and E.On Energy as the four worst performing suppliers for customer service.
Utilita, which was rated the worst of all, said it had ""issues"" with Citizens Advice's approach to recording complaints, ""regardless of whether we are at fault"".
""Yet again, the Citizens Advice Star Rating fails to reflect neither the unique nature of our business nor the service our customers receive,"" a spokesman said.
It accused Citizens Advice of not adjusting its records to reflect ""where the supplier has done nothing wrong, and we have had no contact with the customer"".
""We acknowledge that we can do better, but we strongly believe Citizens Advice employs a methodology that is unfairly weighted against us as a smart prepay specialist.""
E.On said it had seen an ""unprecedented spike"" in contact from customers during the months ahead of the April price change and apologised to ""any customer who feels our service fell short around this time"".
Ecotricity founder Dale Vince said Citizens Advice's numbers ""do not represent our current performance"".
He said since the statistics were recorded, the company had recruited more staff to cope with higher demand.
Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, said it was working with suppliers to improve service, adding that ""now is the time for them to up their game"".
""Our top priority is to protect consumers, and as these stats from Citizens Advice show, there are areas where customers are simply not getting the service they desperately need and rightly expect in these very difficult times,"" it said.
""We are clear with suppliers - they must not use the current gas crisis as an excuse for poor performance or sharp practices."""	/news/business-62008383
health	Newly qualified nurse 'scared for her future' in profession	"A recently qualified nurse says she is unsure if she will continue in her job, just 18 months into her career.
Bethany Tulloch, from Northumberland, is a Royal College of Nursing (RCN) member who feels ""betrayed and let down"" by the government.
22-year-old, who is taking part in the national strike, fears for the future of nursing without change.
RCN wants a 19% pay increase for its members, but the UK government says their demands are unaffordable.
government said this year's pay increase reflected the independent NHS Pay Review Body's recommendations.
""I'm scared for my future and where the nursing profession is going to be in 10 to 20 years time,"" Bethany told the BBC.
""If things don't change I don't see myself continuing as a nurse and that's really sad.
""We are trained medical practitioners. We do a lot of hours before we even get into a hospital, we do a lot of training and I don't think our pay reflects that at all.""
rting salary for a nurse in England is just over £27,000 a year, but Bethany has had to give up her apartment in recent months.
""I moved out because I couldn't afford to live there anymore,"" she said.
""I've moved back in with my parents.""
Bethany was one of tens of thousands of nurses took industrial action across England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Thursday, and will be back on strike again on Tuesday.
""I did it for my patients, I did it for me,"" she said.
However, just a few hours after leaving the picket line she was back at Cramlington's Emergency Care Hospital because she claimed it was ""severely undermanned"".  
She said although she was proud of her job, the workload was ""emotionally and physically"" draining because she was often caring for dozens of patients by herself.
In September, research by the Nuffield Trust think tank for the BBC revealed nurses were leaving the profession nearly as fast as they were being recruited, with nearly one in 10 posts vacant.
""It's often up to 30 patients with different medical conditions who need a high level of care to one single nurse,"" said Bethany. ""That's what the staffing shortages have caused.""
RCN has said that if there is no move to reopen pay talks, then new strike dates will be announced before Christmas with a series of walkouts likely in January.

health	Alopecia: 'I decided I'd had enough of hiding my real self'	"Laura Mathias was just 13 years old when she started losing her hair. She automatically blamed herself.
Her doctor diagnosed her with the autoimmune condition alopecia and said it was caused by stress. Laura's parents were going through a divorce and she was finding life difficult. 
For the next 17 years she kept her hair loss secret, using a series of wigs that irritated her scalp and often made her head bleed.
During the pandemic, Laura found the confidence to leave home in Manningtree, Essex, without her wig and began posting about her condition on Instagram.
Here, in her own words, she describes her hopes for the future now she has learned to embrace living her life as a bald woman.
My hairdresser first found a small bald patch at the back of my scalp when I was 13 and suggested to my mum that we go to a doctor. 
r told me it was alopecia and said not to get stressed because it would get worse, and that if I calmed down it might grow back. Straight away I started blaming myself.
He told me there were some online chatrooms I could use, run by the charity Alopecia UK, but I didn't want to accept what was happening to me.
My parents were arguing all the time and it was incredibly stressful. I was waking up to hair all over my pillow and I was so embarrassed that I stopped going to school. 
I didn't leave the house for six months and everything stopped. I fixated on my exercise bike because it was the only thing I could control and I lost a lot of weight.
Aged 14, I asked my hairdresser to shave my head and help me find a wig. It was actually too big for me and immediately aggravated my scalp. I also suffer from eczema and the wigs made it so much worse for so many years.
I forced myself back to school and was put in the bottom sets, but I managed to argue that I had potential and I should be allowed back in the higher groups. That was make or break and thank goodness I went back, because I don't know where I would be today otherwise. 
I would spend all of my money on expensive wigs to make sure my secret wasn't exposed. I didn't go on holiday or anything because it cost me £3,000 for a wig that would last for two years.
When I left the house it was 'wig Laura'. When I was at home, curtains shut, 'bald Laura'. That is how extreme it was. I didn't see any other option.
I started following the hashtag 'alopecia' on Instagram and suddenly it was like the curtains were drawn back and I thought, 'Oh my god, there are other people like me out there'. 
During the pandemic, I decided I'd had enough of hiding my hair loss. How many years would I have carried on wearing a wig to the point where my head would bleed, if my routine hadn't been disrupted?
In summer 2020, I took part in a photo shoot without my wig to test the water. I started to share my story on social media to build my confidence. 
I felt if I was chronicling it online and people were following me, I had to take my wig off. It was only very recently that I started going out without my wig on a casual basis, and I'm still learning to feel completely comfortable with that.
I've made so many great friends through sharing my story. I've met lots of other young women going through hair loss and it has normalised being bald for me.
I recently met a friend I made online in Rotterdam who lost her hair in her 30s. It has taken me nearly 20 years to accept this, so I'm amazed by people who have gone through this so recently who are at peace with it.
Until I met these people, the only images I was exposed to of bald women were models who were thin with a trendy shaved head. I needed to see real women of all sizes to accept myself. 
re is still such a long way to go. I would love to see patchy hair loss in a magazine and I'd love to see more people with alopecia in the media in general, not just talking about their hair loss.
re was only one place where I was still keeping my hair loss a secret - the workplace. 
I've always kept it hidden in all of the jobs I've had, but I recently got a new job for Save The Children and I decided to change that.
I did my interview on Zoom without a wig on. I haven't gone to the office bald yet, but I have worn my bandana which feels like a massive step. 
It's always stressful starting a new job and I had an eczema flare up and lost my eyelashes. I felt sore and self conscious, so I felt I needed my bandana and I'm OK with that.
I started posting on LinkedIn after the Oscars incident, where Will Smith hit Chris Rock for making a joke about his wife's alopecia. I wanted to give my point of view. The awareness of alopecia after the Oscars was massive, even though it wasn't the most positive of incidents.
LinkedIn recently asked me to take part in the first UK creator accelerator programme and I've really enjoyed working with them. I want to celebrate people with a visible difference who can act as mentors at work, and I hope my ideas can be used to improve the workplace for everyone.
Alongside dealing with alopecia, I was recently diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and it's really helping me make sense of so many different aspects of my life. 
I wanted to understand myself better and I started reading about women being diagnosed later in life. It made so much sense to me.
I don't have a filter and I struggle to focus, which is a common sign and I am a massive over-sharer. I often go off on tangents and I say 'yes' to everything and get burned out. 
I studied film and literature at the University of Warwick and it was a struggle because I pushed myself so hard at the expense of my health and managed to get a first.
It is exhausting trying to mask it. Standard adult tasks like keeping on top of the washing up and sorting your house out can be difficult. I also believe I have rejection sensitivity dysphoria, which is closely related to ADD, so I feel any sort of rejection so keenly. 
fear of being rejected changes my behaviour and it has impacted my relationships. I've always been told I'm sensitive and I can be too much. It is nice to feel vindicated, I've been coping with my brain working differently. I'm still working it all out but at least I now have a diagnosis.
People who are newly going through hair loss, or sometimes parents, often message me on Instagram. I always make it very clear that every person's experience is unique. A lot of people have a short experience of hair loss and it will come back, they might not have Alopecia Areata, which I originally had, before it developed into Alopecia Universalis, meaning I have no hair at all. I always ask people, 'Do you have people around you who you can talk to about this?'. I signpost them to help from the charity Alopecia UK who I volunteer with. I'm also involved with the charity Changing Faces and took part in their Stop The Stare campaign, which raised awareness about the fact staring can be damaging to the wellbeing of those with a disfigurement or visible difference.
I still notice people staring at me when I'm out without a wig. I think they presume I've got an illness like cancer and I'm going through treatment so I get a lot of sympathetic looks, which makes me feel uncomfortable.
I really hope that future generations won't stare and will just accept us. That's one of the reasons I'm doing as much as I can to raise awareness of alopecia.
I still have days where I feel like I want to wear a wig and I haven't gone to a wedding yet without one, but I'm going out more and more as a proud bald women and I never thought I would be able to do that. It's just nice to have the choice.
I've spent my whole life not wanting to stand out and for people not to realise I'm wearing a wig. But now, I know it doesn't matter if people notice what's on my head or not. 
Living with this visible difference is an integral part of who I am, whether I choose to wear wigs or not, but it's not the only part of my identity. So look at me if you like, ask me questions if you want to know more, but do not think my hair (or lack of it!) is the most interesting thing about me.
As told to Charlie Jones.
