business	Average five-year mortgage rate hits 12-year high	"rest rate on a typical five-year fixed rate mortgage has topped 6% for the first time in 12 years.
w has a rate of 6.02%, the financial information service Moneyfacts says, a level not seen since February 2010.
Mortgage rates have been rising for months, but saw a sharp increase following the mini-budget last month.
rise in rates comes as the heads of major UK lenders met the Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng.
Bosses from banks such as Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds Banking Group attended the meeting which was part of a regular series of talks, but the latest developments in the mortgage market were discussed.
Rates have jumped sharply in the past couple of weeks, and hundreds of mortgage deals have been taken off the market.
A Treasury statement following the meeting said that ""while it is the responsibility of the sector to provide the best value for mortgage rates"", the chancellor confirmed the Treasury would ""continue to work closely with the sector"" in the weeks and months ahead.
Earlier this week, the rate on a typical two-year fixed rate mortgage breached 6% for the first time in 14 years, and by Thursday had hit 6.11%, according to Moneyfacts.
First-time buyers and those looking to re-mortgage are affected. An average of at least 100,000 people a month are coming to the end of their current mortgage, and face a significant rise in their monthly repayments.
Research from housing market website BuiltPlace suggests that rates of 6% mean that repayments on an average new mortgage will account for more than a quarter of household income. That is the highest burden on households since the recession of the early 1990s.
Uncertainty over future interest rates after the mini-budget led lenders to pull more than a thousand deals from the market. 
re slowly starting to return - there were 3,961 products a fortnight ago, now there are 2,430 - but have become more expensive on average.
Earlier this week, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, the Halifax, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group, raised its rates on a range of deals for new borrowers to well over 5%.
Mortgage brokers say lenders are ""playing safe"" with rates amid current economic uncertainty, but costs could eventually start to dip."	/news/business-63155597
politics	Wales council tax: Don't rush into changes, warn council leaders	"Wales should not ""rush into"" changing people's council tax bands when their finances are stretched and the economy unstable, council leaders have warned.
A July consultation included plans for reforms in 2025, after the first council tax revaluation in 20 years.
Vale of Glamorgan leader Lis Burnett said putting some households in higher bands ""could be the final straw"".
Ministers said ""any changes will be carefully thought through"" and take account of financial pressures.
Ms Burnett agreed with the Welsh government's aim of making the tax fairer but expressed concerns about the timing. 
At the last revaluation a third of households saw their bills rise, although the Welsh government says the process does not necessarily mean tax bills will go up.
move is part of the Welsh Labour government's deal with Plaid Cymru, which was signed a year ago.
More bands could also be added at the top and bottom of the range, and a system of rolling revaluations could be implemented every five years.
Critics say council tax is out of date because it is based on old property values, and does not fairly tax people on lower incomes.
Labour Vale of Glamorgan leader Ms Burnett was asked at a Senedd committee on Thursday whether now is the right time to make changes to the system.
""I think that is a matter of huge concern, in terms of when it's done and how it's communicated,"" she told the Local Government and Housing Committee. 
""You can't overstate the pressure that people are under at the moment, but at the same time, there are currently people that are disadvantaged by the system."" 
re was a need to be ""very careful"" and ""certainly not to rush into"" changes ""until there's some stability within the economy"".
""The thought of this adding one more straw on to people's already heavy load, [it] could be the final straw.""
Dyfrig Siencyn, Plaid Cymru leader of Gwynedd Council and a former valuation officer, agreed that ""timing is important"". 
""The housing market at the moment is one that is unstable, interest rates have increased, there is pressure on house prices. 
""From a practical perspective, I do think we need to reach a point of stability in the market, never mind fiscal [tax] stability, for our people and financial security, so timing is important.
""Perhaps we should wait a while to see the economy in general settling down to something that is more normal.""
ultation document stated: ""If the Welsh government were to undertake a revaluation exercise, create new bands and choose new tax rates to make the system fairer, this would be an extensive piece of work with the Valuation Office Agency and our local government partners. 
""We would need to bring in a body of new legislation and make some changes to administrative arrangements. 
""To achieve our aims by the end of the current government term (2021-2026), it is our view that 1 April 2025 would be a suitable date to implement reforms, creating a system based on property values in Wales as at 1 April 2023.""
A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""Reforms will modernise the council tax system, making it fairer and more progressive in its design and delivery. 
""The cost-of-living crisis has only added to the importance of this work, and part of what we are considering is how to improve the Council Tax Reduction Scheme, which provides support to low-income households.
""Proposals remain at an early stage and we are reviewing responses to our recent consultation. 
Any changes will be carefully thought through, taking account of financial pressures households are under. Any specific proposals will be the subject of further consultation.""
Welsh government says the tax bands no longer represent today's house values.
Currently band I properties pay three and a half times as much as band A, yet homes in the top band can be worth at least nine times as much.
Until the 2023 revaluation is done it will not be known how many would lose or benefit from the changes.
A 2019 paper by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimated that a revaluation based on the current system could see 26% go down a band, and 26% go up, with 49% remaining the same."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63823820
technology	Cambridge University study says robots may help children open up	"Robots could help identify mental wellbeing issues in children, a study has suggested.
Cambridge University researchers used a child-sized humanoid robot to complete a series of mental health questionnaires with 28 children aged between eight and 13.
found some children were more willing to confide in the robot than in person or in an online questionnaire.
researchers said they hoped to expand their study further.
re presenting the results at a conference in Italy.
Micol Spitale, one of the authors of the study, said they did not have any intention of replacing psychologists or other mental health professionals with robots ""since their expertise far surpasses anything a robot can do"".
But, their research suggested robots ""could be a useful tool in helping children to open up and share things they might not be comfortable sharing at first"", she said.
During the study, each child took part in a one-to-one, 45-minute session with a Nao robot - a humanoid robot about 60cm (24in) tall.
A parent or guardian, as well as members of the research team, observed from an adjacent room.
Before each session, the children and their parent or guardian completed standard online questionnaires to assess the child's mental wellbeing.
Participants then interacted with the robot by speaking with it, or by touching sensors on the robot's hands and feet.
Additional sensors tracked participants' heartbeat, head and eye movements during the session.
research team said all of the participants had told them they enjoyed talking to the robots, and some shared information which they had not shared either in person or in the online questionnaire.
""Since the robot we use is child-sized, and completely non-threatening, children might see the robot as a confidante - they feel like they won't get into trouble if they share secrets with it,"" said PhD student Nida Itrat Abbasi.
results are being presented at the 31st Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication in Naples.

ravelling Light Theatre Company founded its Louder than Words drama group in Bristol to help children express themselves. 
Last year it received £29,942 from the BBC's Children in Need appeal, securing its future for the next three years.
Joby, 13, who is hearing and sight impaired, ""absolutely loves"" the theatre group.
Rosie, Joby's mum, told BBC Points West: ""I'd describe Joby as really energetic and kind of excitable and very sociable. 
""Joby is visually impaired and hearing impaired and so he obviously struggles to see things. 
""Home is a real safe space for him - he loves reading and he loves gaming and he loves TV, things that are up close.
""What is tricky is finding him things to do outside the house.""
""That simple thing of just being around friends and talking with them, he finds it a real, real struggle. 
""Someone mentioned Travelling Light and from the very beginning he just absolutely loved it.""
Rosie said joining the drama group had been like a ""warm hug"" for her son. 
""He comes in and everyone's got their own things going on and he can be himself.""
Joby said: ""It's my safe space because I like the staff there and the children.
""People at Travelling Light have special needs like me so I can relate to them more and find it easier to make friends.""
Sophie Marshall, of the Travelling Light Theatre Company, said:  ""Joby brings so much energy and enthusiasm to the group.
""He's really taken on this role of leader in the session - helping others and supporting others.""
Rosie added: ""We've learned so much from him about differences and being different, and now he's much more proud of who he is. 
""I think this is really helping him - being around people who are also different and feeling like 'actually, it's okay to be me'.""

health	Leicester hospital trust in court row with council over funding	"An NHS trust has taken a local council to court over the way it allocated funding from a development.
University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust has taken Harborough District Council to a judicial review at the High Court in London in connection with a site called Lutterworth East.
row relates to a Section 106 agreement developers pay to local authorities to support the developments they build.
written judgement is due shortly.
Developers pay Section 106 agreements and Community Infrastructure Levies (CILs) as part of planning permission they agree with authorities, with the payment intended to support things like new roads, education and health facilities required by the new community.
wo-day hearing heard the trust had asked for Section 106 cash of up to £1m to cover costs for medical services at the Lutterworth East development.
- which includes 2,750 homes, two schools and warehousing - is being developed by Leicestershire County Council.
rust asked the council to reflect this in the agreement it struck with the developers.
Harborough District Council said it had considered the request but was not able to accommodate it as funding regulations stood.
During the hearing, problems arose in establishing exactly what contracts the local NHS were already committed to and how funding was being projected.
judge, Mr Justice Holgate, said: ""There is an allowance for population growth, but no-one knows exactly what it is - after all this hot air.""
After the two-day hearing, he said he would reserve his judgement.
rties involved expect a written statement from him in the coming days.

health	Stroke patient had to get bus to Ipswich Hospital says wife	"A father suffering a stroke had to take two buses to hospital when his ambulance was cancelled, his wife said.
Lauren Matthews said when her husband Gavin was then cleared to leave Ipswich Hospital a few hours later, his symptoms reappeared but an ambulance was once more diverted elsewhere.
After arriving at A&E for a second time thanks to family help, Mr Matthews then had to wait seven hours, she said.
East of England Ambulance Service has apologised to the couple.
Mrs Matthews said her husband Gavin, 45, who they share a six-year-old daughter with, had a seizure and developed a loss of feeling in his right arm on the afternoon of 16 November.
She said an ambulance was dispatched, but shortly afterwards they received a call saying it had been cancelled and they were advised to make their own way to hospital.
Lacking money for a taxi, she said they used tickets purchased earlier in the day to take two buses from their home on the edge of Ipswich to the hospital, about five miles (8km) away.
Speaking of the bus journey, Mrs Matthews said: ""He kept getting stared at because obviously he kept having the seizures on the bus and we just wanted to blank everything out and get there. I tried to make him as comfortable as you possibly could."" 
After an hour's journey, Mrs Matthews said an A&E doctor saw him and then cleared them to return home after a couple of hours.
However, at 01:00 GMT the next morning, Mr Matthews had another seizure and the symptoms reappeared.
""He couldn't move, so we called an ambulance again,"" said Mrs Matthews.
""They went through the stroke evaluation questions and they said we'll send an ambulance for you. Then again twenty minutes later, cancelled.""
me family members were available and on arrival to their home Mrs Matthews said she carried her husband to a car, where he was then driven to hospital.
She said he was triaged quickly at A&E, but did not get to see a doctor until about 10:00 GMT - seven hours after he arrived. 
Mrs Matthews said a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan carried out later that day confirmed he had suffered a stroke. 
He remains at the hospital and has lost the ability to walk, she said, adding at one point he had also been forced to lie in a soiled bed, despite asking staff for help.
""A stroke is life-threatening. You have four hours in which to get the right treatment for that kind of thing and they failed him. He's had his life changed forever,"" said Mrs Matthews.
uple live in a flat and Mrs Matthews said unless they could find a property that was adapted for a wheelchair, her husband would not be able to return home unless he regained the ability to walk.
East of England Ambulance Service has repeatedly warned it is under ""extreme pressure"". For the past 16 months it has been operating at the National Ambulance Resilience Unit's Resource Escalation Action Plan (REAP) Level 4 - the highest alert level for ambulance services.
An ambulance service spokesman said: ""We apologise to Mr Matthews and his wife for their experience. 
""When demand on the service is extremely high, we must prioritise those with immediate life-threatening conditions and advise some lower category calls to make their own way to hospital, once reviewed by a clinician.
""We are working closely with hospitals to reduce handover delays, getting more ambulance crews back out on the road to improve care for our patients and investing in more senior clinical presence within our control centre to further improve patient safety.""
Dr Angela Tillett, chief medical officer at East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Ipswich Hospital, said: ""We were very sorry to hear about the issues raised by Mrs Matthews about the standards of care Mr Matthews has received at Ipswich Hospital.
""An investigation is under way and we will involve Mr and Mrs Matthews fully with our review and findings.""

politics	Tory leadership: Why would anyone want to be prime minister now anyway?	"Why on earth would anyone - especially those seeking to lead the Conservative Party - want to be prime minister? 
Well, you get a fancy Georgian house in central London, hundreds of staff, private travel and a chat with the King every week. 
You even get the chance to do some good and improve people's lives. And whatever happens you'll have a place in history.
But why, right now, would anyone in their right mind put themselves through a leadership election so they can get the top job? 
When I asked this question of an experienced former Downing Street staffer the answer comes: ""I honestly could not answer it.""
At the top of the gruesome list of issues that awaits the next prime minister is that the UK economy is in trouble. 
untry has been getting poorer and the public are feeling it - or as one cabinet minister says: ""We have all the same problems we have before and there is an economic crisis.""
Why has Liz Truss resigned as prime minister? Leila Nathoo explains.
mess created by the short-lived Truss administration has tied the Conservatives to the trouble. Her decisions, and the subsequent ditching of them, singled the UK out for particularly brutal treatment at the hands of the financial markets. 
Families and firms may find it harder to make ends meet and many of them will blame the Tories for the financial pain on its way. 
And whoever ends up in No 10 will have less money in real terms to allocate to public services.  
NHS is seriously stretched, as are services for older people and those with disabilities. Education is struggling to catch up after Covid. 
ransport is creaking, and there are stubborn problems with building houses, as well as the challenges of climate change and energy supply. 
At the risk of depressing you, the list could go on and on. 
Any one of these challenges would be enough to occupy a government's political focus. 
But it's naïve to imagine the squeeze on public budgets that is coming won't make it harder for many government departments to do the job the public needs them to do. 
re is a reason that the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, says there will be ""difficult decisions"". Cuts are coming, not least because inflation is so high. 
Away from home, there is no question of the UK reneging on its support for Ukraine - but there are no answers yet about how long the war will go on, or how it ends. 
How should the UK and its allies deal with China? And the row with the EU about the Irish border rumbles on as the unfinished business of Brexit. 
On paper the new prime minister should have the political ability to start solving those problems because, by historic proportions, the Conservatives have a huge majority in Parliament. 
But thanks to the Tories' internal squabbles and horrors that majority is, in truth, hypothetical. ""The party is ungovernable,"" says a cabinet minister.
where the personalities of the candidates vying to the next prime minister come in (sorry, I know some of you wish it wasn't about the characters but it's just part of the deal). 
One of the biggest personalities belongs to Boris Johnson - forced from office this summer by his colleagues.
However, there was a chunk of Tory MPs who stood clapping - some on the verge of weeping - when he left office and who are convinced he is the answer now. 
One of his cabinet backers says ""it was existential for us in 2019, and it is existential for us now"" - joking that they are ""plotting the biggest come back since Lazarus"".
usands of column inches have already been devoted to whether that is a good idea, or even feasible. Let's say it came to pass. There would be horror among many of his colleagues, and profound awkwardness for those MPs, including many of his then-backers, who called publicly for him to go. 
One former minister worries: ""Half the party will be upset and 90% of the country will be upset.""
Another MP says: ""I keep thinking I'm in a never-ending nightmare, then I realise that I actually am. I keep asking my colleagues if they are having memory loss.""
Boris Johnson is without question the biggest political celebrity around. But many of his colleagues believe now it's infamy, not admiration. 
He couldn't keep the party together under his leadership last time, so why is there a chance he will now? Lazarus may have been raised from the dead, according to the Bible, but it was suggested he never smiled again. 
But there is an equivalent risk for former Chancellor Rishi Sunak - who is likely to end up as the MPs' favourite. 
Some blame him for Mr Johnson's downfall and may never fully accept him as the leader if he wins, with one source warning: ""There is a significant part of the Conservative Party that will not serve under Rishi.""
Sunak and Johnson camps are a cracked mirror of each other - both would likely find it hard to bring the party together, leading to what one cabinet minister calls a ""never-ending circle of arguments"". 
, by the way, is where Penny Mordaunt's backers believe she could win - free of the toxic baggage, and able to pull the party together as a team captain who could lead. 
What is Johnson up to?
While I'm writing this, we don't yet know if Boris Johnson is actually going to stand. You won't be surprised to learn this is a classic Boris Johnson move. 
His allies are convinced he wants to do it. Some of his colleagues and superfans are cockahoop that he wants to do it. But he is not confirming he will do it. Why?
Until he is sure he will get the numbers to avoid being humiliated by not making the final cut he would rather dangle the possibility, and perhaps enjoy the attention, than confirm he will stand. 
If he does not get into the final two he can say ""ah ha, well I never said I would stand, thank you for the kind suggestion, but I never really meant it, it's not the right time"". 
But it's not clear that being loathed by no-one will translate into being liked enough.
And then there are the polls. The Tories' ratings have fallen off a cliff. Could they climb back? Of course, anything is possible. 
But the polls suggest disaster, not just a dip, and superhuman leadership will be required to make a full recovery from this.  
ublic, quite rightly, often gets on with more interesting things than what's going on at Westminster, but this time the public has noticed and for the most part largely disapproves of what the Conservatives have been doing.  
So why would anyone want the job? 
's politics. The mixture of the high-minded call to serve and the low lust of of ambition. 
Or as one former senior minister says: ""There is always someone in the Tory Party who believes that they are the one who can lead everyone to the promised land.""

business	Post Office scandal victims to get more money	"More than 500 sub-postmasters wrongly suspected or accused of taking money by the Post Office are to get an interim payment worth around £40,000 each.
were all affected by faulty software which made it look like money was missing from their branches.
Despite winning £58m in compensation in 2019, the group's funds were swallowed up due to a ""no win, no fee"" agreement.
Many have been left with no financial resources, while being excluded from other Post Office compensation schemes.
Postal Affairs Minister, Paul Scully, announced in March that this group would be put on a level pegging to other victims in this scandal, but it has taken months to lay out the process for that to take place, after years of fighting to prove their innocence.  
Now Mr Scully says an interim payment of compensation totalling £19.5m will be paid until a final agreement is reached, which he said he hopes would go some way to helping many postmasters who are still facing hardships.
Some of this group had been given wrongful criminal convictions and so are entitled to separate higher payouts, but the majority who lost their jobs, their businesses and their livelihoods have so far been excluded. 
ut has brought relief of a kind to many within the group, after mounting frustration as they felt strung along by promises from the minister without any details.
minister says the latest payments will be made within weeks, but it's not a final amount yet.
Freeths solicitors, who represented the victims in the civil case, have now been brought in by the government to try to speed up the process of getting those full payments faster.
A Post Office spokesperson said that the chief executive of the Post Office, Nick Read, had been urging the government to take action on this for some time, and that ""Ensuring full, fair and final compensation for all Horizon Scandal victims is a priority as we put right the wrongs of the past.""
re was also more information about progress for those who have had their convictions overturned. Despite having their names cleared, no final settlements have been reached.
Many are old, and plenty are still struggling financial after decades of bankruptcy for a crime they were not guilty of. 
Legal teams had been at such loggerheads on how to financially quantify the impact of this scandal that a neutral party has been appointed to come up with a suggestion. 
Mr Scully has announced that former Supreme Court Judge Lord Dyson is expected to make an announcement by the end of July."	/news/business-61992764

Department of Transport said the project will also produce 300,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel a year. 
UK government said this was ""enough to fly to the moon and back about 60 times"" and equates to around 14,331,300 miles (23,063,991 km).
One of the projects will be based at Port Talbot steelworks and will convert steel mill off-gases into fuel.

David Jenkins died on 9 October, coroner Andrew Walker told North London Coroner's Court on Thursday.
Mr Jenkins worked with Daley, a Great Britain Olympic gold medallist, and was part of Team GB's Tokyo 2020 Olympic training squad.
His family, from Barnet, watched the hearing via video-link and asked questions about the inquest process.
Mr Walker told them the court was waiting for the Foreign Office to receive police, post-mortem and toxicology reports from Turkey.
A member of the family asked whether the coroner needed to hear from people who were with Mr Jenkins at the time he died.
Mr Walker said it would be helpful if the family could provide a list of witnesses so the court could approach them for their accounts of the events leading up to Mr Jenkins' death.
Another family member asked to be taken through the process as it ""would help us just to prepare ourselves emotionally"".
wo days after Mr Jenkins' death, British Swimming released a statement on its website saying: ""All our thoughts and condolences go out to David's wife, family and friends, and we please ask that their privacy, and that of the British diving community, be respected at this difficult time.
""We will be working closely with staff and athletes who have been affected by this awful news.""
British Swimming said Mr Jenkins was the development lead coach for Dive London, overseeing the progress of the next generation of elite athletes at the London Aquatics Centre during his eight years involved with the diving programme there.
It added that Mr Jenkins had played an ""instrumental role"" in the Tom Daley Diving Academy, delivering lessons to thousands of children across the country.

technology	Iran protests: US to ease internet curbs for Iranians	"US says it will ease internet curbs on Iran to counter Tehran's clampdown on protests which were sparked by a woman's death in police custody.
""We are going to help make sure the Iranian people are not kept isolated and in the dark,"" said US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.
relaxation of software controls will allow American tech firms to expand their business in Iran.
At least 35 people have been killed in the worst unrest in Iran for years.
Mahsa Amini, 22, fell into a coma last week, hours after morality police arrested her for allegedly breaking headscarf rules. 
Officers reportedly beat Ms Amini's head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered ""sudden heart failure"".
Anti-government protests continued for an eight straight night on Friday, while pro-regime rallies also took place in Tehran and other cities. 
Mr Blinken said the partial relaxation of internet restrictions was a ""concrete step to provide meaningful support to Iranians demanding that their basic rights be respected"". It was clear, he added, that the Iranian government was ""afraid of its own people"".
US treasury said the move would help counter the Iranian government's attempt to ""surveil and censor"" its people.
But it is unlikely to have an immediate impact as it ""does not remove every tool of communications repression"".
Billionaire Elon Musk said on Twitter that he would activate his satellite internet firm, Starlink, to provide internet services to Iran in response to Mr Blinken's announcement.
Starlink provides internet services via a huge network of satellites and is aimed at people who live in remote areas who cannot get high-speed internet.
US officials said that the updated license did not cover hardware supplied by Mr Musk but his firm and others were welcome to apply for permission to the treasury.
Footage shared on social media on Friday showed large crowds of protesters gather in several Tehran neighbourhoods after dark, while other incidents occurred elsewhere the country. In the protests women have defiantly taken off their hijabs and burned them, or cut off their hair in front of cheering crowds. 
While spreading across much of the country, many of the early protests were concentrated in western Iran, particularly areas with large Kurdish populations, the group Ms Amini belonged to.  
On Friday, reports emerged from Oshnavieh, in Iran's West Azerbaijan Province, which borders Kurdistan, showing widespread protests, as well as suggestions demonstrators had taken control of large parts of the city. The BBC was unable to confirm this. 
Videos posted from Oshnavieh showed large crowds of people marching through city streets with no police presence, while loud explosions could be heard. 
Friday also saw pro-regime demonstrations in Tehran and other cities, with those present declaring support for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been a target of anti-government protesters. 
President Ebrahim Raisi spoke at a pro-government event, saying he would not allow the country's security to be ""threatened"". 
""We will not allow people's security to be put at risk under any circumstances,"" he said, shortly after returning from the United Nations General Assembly in New York. 
Stressing that Iran's ""enemies"" wanted to exploit the unrest, Mr Raisi said the government would listen to criticism over Ms Amini's death, but would not be influenced by ""rioting"".

entertainment	Wakanda Forever 'will honour Chadwick Boseman's legacy'	"Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther co-stars say Wakanda Forever is dedicated to honouring his legacy.
US actor, who played heroic crime-fighting king T'Challa, died of cancer in 2020, aged 43.
Co-stars Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o say they are still processing his untimely death.
But Danai, who plays Okoye, says it is the cast's ""hope and prayer"" that the sequel's attempt to honour him ""is felt by the audience"".
""Some scenes you want to break down and cry,"" adds Letitia. 
""[Grief] is still there like that's one of the things about this project that's been one of the hardest, you can't run from it.
""We walked through it together and we just made sure that every line, every scene was just dedicated to him.
""I knew he was listening.""
Speaking to Radio 1Xtra, the trio also discussed returning to set after Covid lockdowns, filming underwater and inspiring change in Hollywood.
Chadwick Boseman: Five things to know
Wakanda Forever, released on Friday, returns to the fictional African country with incredibly advanced technology.
Letitia plays Shuri, the Black Panther's sister, Danai stars as Okoye, head of the Wakandan armed forces and Oscar-winner Lupita becomes Nakia, an undercover spy in service to Wakanda. 
""We have a predominantly female-led film,"" says Lupita.
""We already did something like that with the first Black Panther but now in the absence of T'Challa, the women have taken the fore in a remarkable way.
""That this film is as big as it is with that feminist agenda is so cool.""
And on the subject of women leading the way, Rihanna released her first solo single in six years, Lift Me Up, to accompany the film.
quel comes four years after Black Panther was released to rave reviews and big box office receipts.
And for the actors it was their first return to filming since the Covid pandemic.
""It felt more intense maybe because we were coming out of a lockdown situation it was like one of the first things I did outside of being in my house for a year,"" says Danai.
For the first read-through, the actors had to 6ft (1.8m) apart due to restrictions, which Lupita admits was a bit ""awkward"".
But she remembers feeling ""as we read, it just started to feel more possible"".
In another first, the film features underwater sequences.
""Before this film, Ryan [Coogler, director] sent me a cryptic text message saying, 'on the scale of one to 10 how well can you swim?'"" says Lupita.
""I said four, because I swim like a panicked puppy.""
She had to take swimming lessons, followed by extreme performance training.
It involved underwater tasks - like walking along the bottom of a pool - to increase her breath capacity.
""My thinking was they're going to be asking me not just to swim but to act as I'm swimming,"" she says.
rio are tight-lipped about the possibility of a third film but said they had ""so much fun"" on set.
""In this film, I felt really loved and I really have a family [here],"" says Danai. 
""No matter how many times you come back to do this, or where life takes us, I definitely have a family.""

entertainment	Essex film office: Council wants county 'top of the list'	"A dedicated movie office is being set up to ensure Essex is ""at the top of the list of great places to film"".
Essex County Council has appointed a film officer who will promote the county to location managers and liaise with Creative UK.
Councils in Kent and Suffolk have already established similar offices.
Apple TV's The Essex Serpent and Mission: Impossible - Fallout were both filmed in the county in recent years.
""Essex has some of the most diverse and beautiful landscapes in the UK and currently our coast is of particular interest to directors and location managers,"" said Erica Gilson, the council's marketing and business development manager.
""We need to ensure that we're getting Essex out there and that we're at the top of the list of great places to film.""
Ms Gilson, speaking at a council committee meeting earlier in October, also said the office would help minimise disruption to local residents and businesses during filming.
British Film Institute estimated that film and TV producers spent a record £5.64bn in the UK in 2021.
Shots for the 2013 Hollywood movie, World War Z, starring Brad Pitt, were filmed at Hanningfield Reservoir near Chelmsford, while Thorndon Country Park in Brentwood was used for a scene in the 2018 Mission Impossible film.
As well as in The Essex Serpent, an adaptation of the Sarah Perry novel starring Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes, the county's coastline was also featured in shots for the 2017 ITV drama, Liar.
A scene from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which was set in Venice, included shots from Tilbury Docks.
Most recently, Colchester Utd's football stadium was used in the filming of an Indian movie production.

technology	Could hydrogen ease Germany's reliance on Russian gas?	"war in Ukraine has upended Germany's energy policy.
Since the start of the war Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian oil from 35% to 12% and on Russian gas from 55% to 35%.
Nevertheless, energy trading is a huge source of revenue for Moscow. Over the first two months of the war Germany paid almost €9bn (£7.7bn; $9.6bn) for Russian oil and gas imports according to the Finnish thinktank CREA.
Veronika Grimm is an economics professor at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, and currently one of Germany's three special advisors to the federal government, called Economic Sages.
""We need to diversify and decarbonise our energy sources faster than initially planned,"" she says. To help achieve that goal, Ms Grimm wants the nation to ""ramp-up"" its use of hydrogen.
Hydrogen can store vast amounts of energy, replace natural gas in industrial processes, and power fuel cells in trucks, trains, ships or planes that emit nothing but vapour of drinkable water.
Ms Grimm's enthusiasm is gaining traction, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), an energy research group, dozens of countries have published national hydrogen strategies, or are about to.
Despite this flurry of interest, it's not clear yet that the large-scale use of hydrogen can be made viable.
After all, there has been similar excitement before: in the 1970s, after two oil crises, and in the 1990s, when climate worries arose. But both petered out. So, is today's hype any different?
Sceptics warn that industry representatives, who globally dominate most hydrogen councils, are often biased in favour of hydrogen as it promises subsidies and keeps up demand for existing assets such as pipelines, tankers, turbines or boilers. 
rgue that politicians like big, green-sounding plans for a more distant future rather than more difficult solutions. 
While small amounts of hydrogen are being extracted directly from the ground, most hydrogen is manufactured. That is largely done in two ways, each marked by a colour code.
Green hydrogen is produced by using electricity from renewable power to split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules using an electrolyser. But those machines and the electricity to run them remain costly.
means that, at the moment, such emission-free hydrogen makes up only 0.03% of global hydrogen production, according to the IEA.
Up to five times cheaper is so-called grey hydrogen, this is derived from natural gas, or in some cases from oil or coal. But due to losses during production, about 50% more CO2 is emitted than if natural gas were directly burned.
A related technique is known as blue hydrogen. This relies on the same process, but captures about 60-90% of the carbon emitted in production for re-use or storage.
rawback with this method is that it roughly doubles the cost and lacks production facilities at large scale. So only 0.7% of globally-produced hydrogen is blue.
So, despite its environmentally-friendly image and potential, the global production of hydrogen currently emits almost three times as much CO2 as a whole country, France, for instance.
Much then will hinges on how countries decide to produce hydrogen.
Some countries already have a clear priority - to power electrolysers most sun-baked nations bet on solar power, while France relies on nuclear energy.
China meanwhile cherishes cheap grey hydrogen from coal and gas and invests in green alternatives.
US, Canada, UK, Netherlands and Norway are leading the push for blue hydrogen, by injecting captured carbon into oil and gas fields for long-term storage, or for so-called enhanced oil recovery that boosts extraction.
In Germany, however, the picture is less clear. 
Volker Quaschning, professor for renewable energy systems at Berlin's University of Applied Sciences and criticises Germany's hydrogen strategy: ""Merkel's government used it as a red herring to conceal its own failures in the energy transition.""
He argues that solar and wind power should have been expanded faster to facilitate future green hydrogen production - a step that Germany's new government has promised to take.
However, on hydrogen the three parties in the governing coalition, the three responsible ministries, and the hydrogen council all internally argue whether to concentrate on green hydrogen, or to accept the blue alternative, to temporarily bridge the gap in limited supply. 
Ms Grimm represents the majority view on the hydrogen council in favouring a multi-colour mix.
""Accepting blue hydrogen will help create the supply that we need for a budding industry,"" she argues. ""It will foster technological breakthroughs in Germany and encourage potential suppliers to invest in green hydrogen production.""
In January, Economy Minister Robert Habeck announced an ambitious push for renewables and a doubling of the two-year old target for domestic production capacity of green hydrogen to rise by a factor of 150 from 70 MW today to 10 GW by 2030. 
rget represents a quarter of the entire EU's aim of 40GW, and is larger than France's goal of 6.5 GW.
So while this domestic production expands, Germany is looking to source hydrogen from abroad.
Andreas Kuhlmann, head of the German Energy Agency, (a government-owned company facilitating the energy transition coordinating the Hydrogen Council), says Germany has dramatically sped-up international negotiations to buy hydrogen.
uld include developing hydrogen pipelines to connect to southern Europe, where favourable conditions for solar and wind power allow the cost-efficient production of hydrogen. 
Mr Habeck is frantically visiting energy exporters. Within one week in March, he travelled to Norway to agree on a feasibility study for the construction of a hydrogen pipeline, went to Qatar to finalise an energy partnership and visited the United Arab Emirates to sign five cooperation agreements.
first deliveries from the UAE are expected to arrive later this year.
Other countries on Mr Habeck's hydrogen radar are Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Chile, Namibia and Australia.
ugh he acknowledges the need to import hydrogen, Mr Quaschning dashes some of Mr Habeck's hopes. ""Importing hydrogen from desert plants will be sluggish, inefficient and expensive,"" he explains.
Each step in the supply chain uses up some of the original energy: desalinating sea water to get fresh water as raw material, electrolysis, liquification for shipping, transport via tanker, local transport via pipeline in Germany and re-conversion of hydrogen into electricity.
""Together, these steps would eat up at least 70% of the electricity originally produced in the desert,"" Mr Quaschning says.
""So, even though a solar panel in the desert produces 80% more electricity than one in Germany, the losses on the way are so big, that it would be twice as effective to directly produce solar power in Germany.""
Due to its high-cost, hydrogen is often referred to as the champagne of the energy transition. So, who will get the first sips?
On this, most observers agree. ""It is crucial that we allocate hydrogen only to those industries, where direct electrification is not possible"", explains Felix Matthes energy expert at Öko-Institut, a think tank, and member of Germany's hydrogen council.
""So, we should first use it in the production of steel, chemicals and glass,"" he argues.
Subsequent sectors could be shipping, long distance truck transport, as well as planes for medium or long distances. Other uses in cars or heating are inefficient, costly and impractical distractions, he adds.
""Plus, Mr Habeck's new push for renewables will create a greater need to balance our electricity supply, which hydrogen could do with electrolysers producing hydrogen on sunny, windy days as large-scale storage for cloudy winter days,"" Mr Matthes says.
ressure is on Germany to stop spending so much on Russian energy, but it will be a tricky process.
Many will be hoping that hydrogen eases that transition by fulfilling its promise this time around.

entertainment	Robbie Coltrane obituary: Actor who could be funny or serious, but always compelling	"Robbie Coltrane, who has died at the age of 72, became an international star as the giant Hagrid in the Harry Potter films.
But his reputation in the UK had already been sealed, notably as the chain-smoking forensic psychologist Fitz in Cracker - one of a number of compelling and larger-than-life characters he made his own.
He cut his teeth in stand-up comedy before branching out into films and television, comfortably fitting into both funny and dramatic roles.
And he later rebelled against his middle-class upbringing and fought a well-publicised battle with alcohol addiction.
He was born Anthony Robert McMillan in Rutherglen on the outskirts of Glasgow on 30 March 1950.
His parents were both Calvinists. His mother was a teacher, while his father, a doctor, also worked part-time as a police surgeon.
Coltrane later claimed that his father was so busy, he hardly spoke to his son until he was six. He died of lung cancer when Coltrane was still a teenager.
His mother introduced him to literature and music, and he recalled lying under the piano while she played.
He was sent to Glenalmond public school in Perthshire, sometimes dubbed the Scottish Eton, where he began to kick against authority.
""I didn't accept the hierarchy, basically,"" he later told the Guardian. ""You've crossed the quad and you've got your hands in your pockets. That's not very good, is it?
""But I'm very lucky because I was a big, strong boy. It's essentially survival of the fittest and I was one of the fittest, so I have no complaints.""
xperience later led him to call for the banning of all public schools, and fostered his love of left-wing causes, earning the nickname Red Robbie.
He was threatened with expulsion after hanging the prefect's gowns on the clock tower, but applied himself enough to gather a reasonable education, and his size gained him a place in the school's rugby XV.
When he left school, he enrolled at Glasgow Art School, where he was teased for the posh voice he had laboriously adopted at Glenalmond, so he quickly reverted back to his native Glaswegian accent.
He opted to study painting. Although he quickly realised he'd never excel, he persevered through to his graduation.
""It was a horrible feeling. The ideas were not there on the canvas at all.""
By then, he'd decided film was where he wanted to be. In 1973, his documentary, Young Mental Health, was voted film of the year by the Scottish Education Council.
He was a jazz aficionado and adopted the stage name Coltrane in tribute to John Coltrane, the renowned saxophonist.
He began mixing with actors in Glasgow, taking part-time jobs while appearing on the Edinburgh Fringe and with a number of small theatre groups.
re were small parts in films, including appearances in Flash Gordon and Lindsay Anderson's black comedy Britannia Hospital.
He also featured in the TV series The Comic Strip Presents, which launched the careers of a host of comedy stars including Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson and Jennifer Saunders.
Arguably his big break as a straight actor came when he was cast in the 1986 Neil Jordan film Mona Lisa alongside Bob Hoskins.
For the next few years, his career see-sawed between comedy and more serious roles. 
re was Tutti Frutti, in which he played the lead singer of The Majestics, a chaotic Scottish rock 'n' roll band, and a hilarious performance as Samuel Johnson in Blackadder.
He also played Falstaff in Kenneth Branagh's film version of Henry V.
But, off stage, things were getting out of hand. He was struggling with alcohol addiction, and his friends worried that he had developed a self-destructive streak.
""Booze is my undoing. I can drink a gallon of beer and not feel the least bit drunk,"" he said.
His long on-off relationship with artist Robin Paine, who he had met at art school, also ended at this time after she felt unable to cope with his lifestyle.
failure of two films, Nuns on the Run and The Pope Must Die, helped persuade him to turn away from comedy.
He did that in some style with Cracker, which first aired on ITV in 1993. The writer, Jimmy McGovern, had wanted actor Robert Lindsay for the role, but he was committed to other projects.
role of the criminal psychologist Dr Edward ""Fitz"" Fitzgerald could have been made for Coltrane. His character, like Coltrane, was addicted to alcohol, sarcastic, occasionally foul-mouthed and not a little manic.
ries was a huge hit and Coltrane's performance won him three consecutive Bafta Awards. 
His personal life was also beginning to achieve some stability. He met an 18-year-old student, Rhona Gemmel, and withdrew to a remote farmhouse near Loch Lomond, where they raised two children. The couple married in 1999.
""You can't live the life of an existential hero and be a good father,"" Coltrane remarked.
He also managed to get his drinking, which had contributed to his excessive weight, under control.
In 1995, he played Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky, the Russian Mafia boss in the James Bond film Goldeneye, reprising the role four years later in The World Is Not Enough.
When casting began for the first Harry Potter film in 2000, JK Rowling insisted that Coltrane be given the part of Hagrid, the genial but somewhat indiscreet giant.
""Robbie is just perfect for Hagrid because Hagrid is a very loveable character, quite likeable, quite comic,"" the author said. ""But he had to have - you really do have to sense - a certain toughness underneath, and I think Robbie does that perfectly.""
Coltrane was nominated for a Bafta for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and went on to play the role throughout the rest of the films.
It was while filming the third Harry Potter film that his marriage to Rhona foundered.
reak-up affected him badly and his problems with alcohol, depression and his weight re-emerged, forcing him to seek professional help.
Hagrid made him famous across the world and something of a role model for the film's young fans.
""Kids come up to you and they go, 'Would you like to sign my book?' with those big doe-eyes. And it's a serious responsibility.""
In 2012, he appeared in Mike Newell's film of Great Expectations as Mr Jaggers, the lawyer who looks after Pip's affairs.
He also indulged his passion for classic cars, piloting his Jaguar XK150 around the UK in the TV programme Robbie Coltrane's B Road Britain.
Another Bafta nomination came his way for one of his last major roles, playing a TV host accused of rape in Channel 4's National Treasure.
And he became a little emotional as he got back together with his Harry Potter co-stars in the franchise's televised reunion, which aired earlier this year. It has now become his screen swansong.
""The legacy of the movies is that my children's generation will show them to their children,"" he said.
""So you could be watching it in 50 years time, easy. I'll not be here, sadly. But Hagrid will, yes."""	/news/entertainment-arts-31150653
health	Liverpool's Rowan Garth Care Home must improve or faces closure	"A care home could be shut down in six months' time if it fails to make improvements after a watchdog found its residents were at ""risk of harm"".
Care Quality Commission (CQC) rated Rowan Garth Care Home as inadequate following an inspection in September. 
It found staff at the care home on Lower Breck Road in Liverpool did not always effectively safeguard those living there.
Bloomcare Ltd, which runs the care home, apologised for its failings.
watchdog said it would take enforcement action, which could lead to the home being prevented from operating, if improvements are not made.
September was prompted in part due to the notification of an incident involving a resident who was allegedly abused.
In the report, it found the home was inadequate for its 95 residents.
Residents were described as being at an increased risk of abuse as prevention processes were not always followed, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reports.
CQC report also said multiple safeguarding incidents had also not been referred to Liverpool City Council for investigation, the report said.
But inspector found the senior management team ensured immediate action was taken to mitigate the failures highlighted in the report. 
""However, we are not yet assured that these actions are effective or embedded to ensure that the quality and safety of the service is consistently monitored and improved,"" the inspectors added.
Last year, Covid-19 prevention measures were highlighted as sub-standard with the highest numbers of Covid-related deaths in the city recorded at the home. 
A spokesman for Bloomcare Ltd, part of Wellington Healthcare (Adern Ltd), said it had taken immediate action and had a comprehensive action plan in place.
He said the alleged abuse was an isolated incident with full disclosure given to the relevant authorities.
""We are sorry to our residents and families that we fell short of expectations,"" he said.
""Like all good quality and responsible care providers, we strive to improve all the time and we will continue to do so.""

sports	Winter Olympics: Team GB's results from Beijing 2022	"Great Britain have ended the Beijing Winter Olympics with two medals - a gold and a silver in women's and men's curling.
medal haul was short of the five won at the previous two Games but there were a number of near misses as well, with three top-six finishes.
Check out the information below to see how each member of Team GB performed in China. 
Britain are still searching for a first alpine skiing medal, with slalom specialist Alain Baxter's bronze at Salt Lake City in 2002 rescinded after he failed a drugs test. Dave Ryding finished 13th in the slalom in Beijing.
Britain have won five bobsleigh medals - four bronzes in four-man, and a gold for the 1964 two-man crew of Robin Dixon and Tony Nash. The 2014 bronze medal was awarded to Team GB in 2019 after two Russian crews were disqualified for doping. In Beijing the four-man just missed out on the podium, finishing sixth.
Andrew Musgrave finished seventh in the skiathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics - Britain's best result in the sport - but he could not improve on it in Beijing.
Great Britain continued their medal success in curling with gold and silver in Beijing. Eve Muirhead clinched gold on the final day, adding to Bruce Mouat's silver.
Britain's most successful winter sport with 15 medals - including the seven won when ice skating was featured in the summer Olympics in the early part of the 20th century. From 1976 to 1984, Britain won gold medals in three successive Games with John Curry, Robin Cousins and Torvill and Dean. The ice dance pair then returned a decade later to take bronze in Lillehammer, Norway - which was the last time Britain won a medal in figure skating. Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson showed their potential for 2026 by finishing 10th here.
Izzy Atkin wrote herself into the history books at Pyeongchang in 2018 by becoming the first Briton to win a Winter Olympic ski medal when she took bronze in ski slopestyle. Sadly, she was unable to compete in Beijing and, although no medals were won, there were a number of notable achievements including 17-year-old Kirsty Muir's fifth in ski big air.
Great Britain has never won a medal in luge. Rupert Staudinger, who competed in his second Games, came 23rd.
Nicky Gooch is the sole Britain to have won a speed skating medal at an Olympics, collecting bronze in the 500m short track race at the 1994 Games.
Until this year, Great Britain had won a skeleton medal every time the sport had been included in the Olympics - which equates to nine in seven Games. In 2018, Lizzy Yarnold became the first Briton to retain an Olympic title after also triumphing in Sochi four years earlier. Beijing was a Games to forget for the GB team, who struggled at the Yanqing Sliding Centre.
Great Britain had never won a Winter Olympic medal in a snow event - until Jenny Jones' bronze medal in slopestyle at the 2014 Games. Four years later, Billy Morgan became the first British man to achieve the feat when he claimed bronze in big air. Charlotte Bankes was favourite to win snowboard cross but was beaten in the quarter-final."	/sport/winter-sports/59586119
business	Four areas added to banking hubs waiting list	"Four more communities have been earmarked for shared banking hubs - becoming the latest on a list of 27 areas waiting for services to begin.
At these hubs, customers of any bank will be able to access their accounts, deposit cash and cheques, and withdraw money at any time.
Only two have opened so far, while hundreds of bank branches have closed.
Fears have been raised that local businesses and vulnerable residents would struggle without cash services.
four new locations which will receive hubs are: Bury Park in Bedfordshire, Haslemere in Surrey, Prestatyn in Denbighshire, and Welling in south east London. 
Residents and local politicians requested the hubs come to their areas owing to previous closures of bank premises.
resa O'Neill, leader of Bexley Council, said she was thrilled a hub was coming to Welling.
""Since losing our last banks almost a year ago, the community has not had convenient access to cash, meaning that residents have had to travel for basic banking needs. 
""This is also damaging to businesses who rely on banks to cash their takings too. We look forward to the change it will make within the town.""
BBC visited a prototype shared banking hub in Rochford, Essex, and was told it had been ""a lifeline"" for many people living in the area after the last branch in town closed.
Running costs are the same as a small branch, but are shared between different banking groups that use it.
However, there is concern that regular bank branches are closing at a rapid rate. Consumer group Which? said that 587 branches have closed this year, with another 75 scheduled to shut by the end of 2022, on top of hundreds in previous years.
re is little chance of these new hubs replacing many of these closed banks at the moment.
Difficulties in opening the new hubs have included finding suitable premises, and making it fully accessible and secure enough for banking services.
Natalie Ceeney, who chairs the Cash Action Group and Banking Hub Company, said: ""We are expecting a couple more to be live before Christmas. We are making good progress with all hubs and expect a significant number to open in early 2023. 
""When we are visiting locations that will get a hub, we are looking for buildings that are the right size, located in an appropriate location and have the facilities to support all customers. We then often need to make changes to the building to make them suitable for a banking hub, some of which need us to get planning permission. This process has not always been easy, but we are making good progress. 
""What is important is this time last year, if a community lost their last branch, there was no solution. Over the next couple of years, we expect to be supporting hundreds of communities across the UK.""
Jenny Ross, money editor at Which?, said: ""Banking hubs could play an important role in ensuring the cash needs of local communities are met. However, the rollout is taking far too long and the hubs must open as soon as possible so consumers can benefit.""
In addition to the hubs, more withdrawal and deposit machines - which are unstaffed but can allow businesses to cash in their takings - will be placed in premises such as libraries and community centres and available during their opening hours.
will be located in Bingley in West Yorkshire, Finchley in north London, Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, Melksham in Wiltshire, Plympton in Devon, and Sandbach in Cheshire."	/news/business-63471272
politics	Don't believe it's back to boring, says Laura Kuenssberg	"After the last few years - let alone the last few weeks - you can see why Michael Gove has said in a speech that he is grateful ""boring is back"". 
Mr Gove, who has returned to cabinet as levelling up secretary and appears on this week's programme, made the comments at the London Press Club awards.
You too might feel relief that the crazy period of the Truss administration has come to an end, and that in Rishi Sunak we seem to have a prime minister who doesn't revel in scrapes and scandals, who doesn't have making headlines at the top of his to-do list. Now who might we be talking about?  
One of his ministers told me that Sunak had ""ended the Tory psychodrama with a careful reshuffle of all the talents and a focus on delivery"", saying it was a sign of the recent turmoil that commentators see that as ""boring"". ""It's actually serious government,"" they added.
Another of his MPs, who did not find a berth in government, had a less flattering assessment, saying: ""He's managed to appoint to some of the dullest people in Parliament to ministerial jobs, so if anybody can succeed in being boring, it's some of these people."" Ouch!  
It is true that we are at the start of a very different era. From 2015 until last month at least one of our big political parties has been led by a deeply unconventional leader.
Jeremy Corbyn's time in office turned Labour upside down. Boris Johnson as the Tory boss provided a daily soap opera. 
Much of the soundtrack to the last seven years has been noisy internal chaos for one - or sometimes both - of Labour and the Conservatives.  
Sunak vs Starmer creates a different atmosphere altogether. The biggest beasts in our politics are now described by colleagues as ""sensible"" and ""measured"". They are both known by their teams to be extremely hard working and diligent.  
f-perpetuating Tory circus has gone, the ring master retired after the crowd didn't clamour for more. And as one government insider notes, both main party leaders ""are keen to establish themselves for their competence rather than political pyrotechnics"". But that is not the same as ""boring"" for several significant reasons. 
Firstly, we are not living in a time when things are ticking over nicely and government can just trundle along. The choices the new prime minister has to make about the economy are huge. 
Watch: Rishi Sunak's first PMQs in the top job... in 64 seconds
And it can't have escaped your notice - with Jeremy Hunt's sober tones, or countless briefings to journalists about the scary size of the black hole in the public finances - that cuts are coming, even if they end up being less grim than the scariest warnings suggest. 
We'll only know the likely result of those decisions when the chancellor gets to the despatch box on 17 November. We can be sure that it won't be pretty. But the decisions for Mr Sunak go way beyond the choices he has to make about the economy, and they are certainly not ""boring"". 
With millions on waiting lists, social care creaking, the risk of blackouts this winter and climate change, choices have to be made fast on a vast range of issues, and those decisions will have massive consequences for us all. 
And while Mr Sunak's approach on the economy is widely known, his broader instincts are less well understood.  
job is huge, according to another government source, who says: ""We have to get five years' worth of work done in about two."" 
But will it be dull? They add: ""It will be calmer and more stable, but to say Sunak is boring is wrong. He actually has quite an innovative way of looking at things so will shake things up, but in a well thought through way.""  
's an optimistic way of looking at it. One Whitehall source describes him differently, as ""the least experienced prime minister we have had in recent history"". Additionally, as chancellor it was possible for him - as others before him - to stay out of sight for long periods of time.  
Successive new prime ministers and their teams have started out with the intention of being less visible, popping up less, determined to concentrate on the job and their priorities rather than get caught up in frippery or spend time on events that don't match their agenda. 
want to avoid the surreal spectacle of Tony Blair once giving a view on the fortunes of fictional Coronation Street character, Deirdre Rachid. If you are lucky enough not to remember this, it really did happen, as this BBC story from the time shows.  
But successive teams who have entered No 10 with that intention find out that in the real world, they can dictate and control far less than they hope. Life comes at them fast, 24 hours a day, from 360 degrees.  
Mr Sunak has discovered already this week with his first visit, to a hospital. 
re were planned images of him chatting to patients, showing empathy and giving a brief clip to broadcasters on the issues of the day - but it was memorable not because of that, but because a patient took him to task, wagging her finger at him for not paying nurses enough. That encounter was not boring.  
Rishi Sunak says it is right he ""focuses on the... pressing domestic challenges"" the UK faces in its economy rather than got to COP27.
And whether it's on health, the environment, welfare, foreign affairs or other issues, it is hard to know where the new prime minister's political reflexes will lie.  
A Whitehall source who has worked alongside him says he ""is sensible, but not a centrist"", and he may surprise some even of his own supporters by erring to the right.  
Politics is about principles, and we'd all want our leaders to be deeply serious about how they make decisions, but it is also about instinct.  
urce, who has served successive prime ministers, wonders if his character will be well suited for the crucible of Downing Street.
""Boris came to reasonable decisions, but made them in a crazy way and didn't stick to them, Liz neither made the right decisions nor made them in a sensible way,"" they said. 
""He [Sunak] will make them in a sensible way, and it will make a difference. But given the way he delves into detail, how will he cope with the span of the job? You can't do a spreadsheet on every issue when you are the prime minister.""
And while he might be generally seen as sensible, Mr Sunak has already willingly walked into a political controversy that is far from dull. 
He hired back Suella Braverman as home secretary just days after she had been fired for breaking the rules for ministers. She had used her personal email to send government documents to a colleague, and they also ended up with someone else by mistake.  
Holding his carefully constructed government together prevents a huge challenge for the new leader, and it's simply not clear yet if he has the political ability to do that with long-term success. Could anyone?  
Conservatives concluded, less than a week ago, that after all the drama, Mr Sunak was their best option. The impulse to survive after the trauma of the Truss explosion led them to choose the candidate closest to being seen as a safe pair of hands.  
With a smart team around him, a party exhausted by arguing with itself, and a personal reputation for being extremely capable and hardworking, that could turn out to be true.  
But there is nothing remotely guaranteed about that coming to pass, nor is there any certainty that the Sunak premiership will be a success. And however much Conservatives might hope for dull stability, it certainly will not be boring for the rest of us to find out.  "	/news/uk-politics-63439096
health	Nottingham hospital menopause scheme hailed by staff	"Hospital staff in Nottingham have said they are keen to build on the success of its menopause support scheme. 
Nottingham University Hospitals Trust (NUH) said 24% of its staff were aged 45-55, the most common age for the condition.
Staff can ask for lighter uniforms, shift changes, more time to complete tasks or access to fans in offices.
Advice, awareness training and access to specialist staff are also part of the scheme.
menopause refers to when periods stop due to lower hormone levels.
Classic symptoms include hot flushes, broken sleep and brain fog.
ff wellbeing team at NUH said they were ""inundated"" with messages from colleagues who were struggling.
rust was the first in the country to be awarded the Menopause Friendly Employer Accreditation and this year was a finalist in the Most Menopause Friendly Environment category in the first Menopause Friendly Employer Award scheme.
Jenny Good, NUH Staff Wellbeing Lead, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""We strongly believe that menopause is an issue for everybody. Everyone knows somebody who will go through it.
""We wanted to equip everyone who works at NUH with an awareness of what menopause is.
""We're really proud that we're the first NHS trust to get the accreditation.
""The conversation has opened up.""
Rachel Meadwell, a ward administrator at Queen's Medical Centre, said: ""There is a lot of taboo around menopause and lack of understanding.
""So since we've had the accreditation I now realise it's happening to a massive proportion of the workforce. It's now an open conversation and that's great.
""I've got a paper fan at all times to keep me cool but I've got an industrial fan in the office now.
""You feel supported now, you know you can contact your line manager or the wellbeing team.""

health	Felixstowe: Nine-hour ambulance wait prompts family action	"A woman said her brother's decision to drive their father to hospital after being told he had a nine-hour wait for an ambulance probably saved his life.
La-Mont, 73, from Felixstowe, was showing signs of a stroke when his wife called 999 on 14 December.
r said because he had movement his symptoms were not serious enough for an emergency response, his daughter Kara La-Mont said. 
mbulance trust said high demand meant they could not always respond. 
Ms La-Mont, 35, also from Felixstowe, said it was obvious her father's condition was serious, describing him as ""normally being a fit and healthy bloke"".
""Dad could move but we still needed to get him to hospital. It was clear something was going on,"" she said.
""Within five minutes, [of the 999 call] he just stood there, he couldn't talk.""
Ms La-Mont's brother, who was working nearby, decided to drive their father to the accident and emergency department rather than wait.
""It's just lucky that he could walk really,"" she said. ""Could he not, it would all be a different scenario.""
Ms La-Mont said her father was seen ""very quickly"", within five minutes of arrival at Ipswich Hospital. 
She said medics confirmed  bleed on the brain after a CT scan. He was given medication to disperse a blood clot. 
Ms La-Mont said he received excellent treatment at the hospital but was concerned about the state of the ambulance service.
""It's hard. There's not enough of them,"" she said.
Her father was discharged on Saturday and is now recovering at home, but will require speech therapy.
In a statement, the East of England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST) said: ""The NHS is currently facing incredibly high demand and we are working very closely with hospitals to reduce handover delays and improve care to our patients.  
""When demand is at its highest we regret that we are sometimes unable to send ambulances as quickly as we would wish, even to our most serious patients. 
""We are working very closely with our NHS partners to reduce handover delays at hospitals to get more ambulance crews back out into the community to improve care for our patients. 
""We are also working to reduce the number of patients going to hospital, including directing patients to urgent community response services when appropriate.""

sports	Courtney Tulloch: World medallist predicts Team GB will 'smash it' at Paris 2024	"World gymnastics bronze medallist Courtney Tulloch has predicted that Team GB will ""absolutely smash it"" at the Paris Olympics in 2024.
finished fourth in the medal table with six podiums at the recent World Championships in Liverpool.
ulloch, 27, claimed the first medal in the rings by a British gymnast after earlier taking a team-event bronze.
French capital is set to stage the Olympics for the third time, 100 years on from last doing so in 1924.
And the British men and women's gymnastics teams have already qualified to compete.
""It takes a lot of pressure off, so now we can start building and focusing on what we want to do in Paris, whether it's the routines, the team selection,"" Tulloch told BBC Essex. 
""I think if we carry on the way we are, we're going to absolutely smash it out in Paris. We've got a lot of work to do before then but it's looking really good.""
He continued: ""For us, it's just amazing that so many people are watching our sport on TV, supporting and getting behind us. We've come such a long way in such a small amount of time and we just want as many eyeballs on our sport as possible.""
ulloch's medals in Liverpool capped a highly successful year which saw him retain his Commonwealth rings title as well as collecting team golds in Birmingham and at the European Championships in Munich - the latter despite a nut allergy reaction the previous night.
""We started off pretty slow in that team final and we had a few mistakes on pommel but for us to come together as a collective, put that behind us and finish with a bronze was just incredible,"" said Tulloch, who first took up the sport aged six and trains in Basildon.
""I was heartbroken watching it because teams don't normally come back from being eighth. The scores on pommel were very low and I hadn't even competed yet.
""But I knew if I went [well] on rings, and that we're a very strong team on vault and parallel bar, so if we could score well on those apparatus we could bring ourselves back.
""It wasn't a time for talking and chatting, it was a time to show our personality and show the hard work we'd been putting in in the gym on the apparatus.""   
Great Britain could have three-time Olympic gold medallist Max Whitlock, a pommel horse specialist, back in the squad for Paris following an extended break from the sport.
""He's looking in incredible shape. It will be a massive lift [to have him back] because he's such a calm, cool character and it's good to have someone like that in the team,"" Tulloch added.
""He's so experienced at the same time so you can go to him for anything. It will just lift everyone's game and it's a real positive to have him in there."""	/sport/gymnastics/63582417
business	Solve worker shortages with immigration - CBI boss	"UK should use immigration to solve worker shortages and boost economic growth, the boss of the UK's biggest business group has said.
Danker called on politicians to be ""practical"" about immigration at the CBI's conference in Birmingham.
His speech comes as many firms struggle to recruit staff.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he wanted to attract the best talent from around the world, but also tackle illegal immigration.
Recent official figures show the UK's unemployment rate has edged up, and the Bank of England has forecast it will nearly double by 2025 as the country goes through a tough recession.
Meanwhile job vacancies remain near record levels.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) has also said UK business investment has dropped in recent months and remains below pre-pandemic levels.
Mr Danker said in his speech that the UK should enable ""economic migration"" in areas where skilled workers cannot be found.
He urged leaders to ""be honest with people"" over the country's ""vast"" labour shortages, adding ""we don't have the people we need nor do we have the productivity"". 
""First, we have lost hundreds of thousands of people to economic inactivity post Covid,"" he said. ""And anyone who thinks they'll all be back any day now - with the NHS under the pressure it is - is kidding themselves. 
""Secondly, we don't have enough Brits to go round for the vacancies that exist, and there's a skills mismatch in any case. And third, believing automation can step in to do the job in most cases is unrealistic.""
Mr Danker is calling for more fixed-term visas for overseas workers in shortage occupations. 
In a speech to the CBI conference, Rishi Sunak said he wanted to attract ""the best and brightest from around the world"" to work in the UK.
He said the UK would create ""one of the world's most attractive visa regimes for entrepreneurs and highly-skilled people"", as he outlined plans to attract experts in artificial intelligence to the country,
But he said the UK's ""number one priority right now, when it comes to migration, is tackling illegal immigration"", adding that he is determined to do that.
""If we're going to have a system that allows businesses to access the best and brightest from around the world, we need to do more to give the British people trust and confidence that the system works and is fair,"" Mr Sunak said.
Earlier, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick told TalkTV that if bosses needed ""lower-skilled"" staff, the domestic workforce should be their ""first port of call"".
""We want to bring down net migration. It's something that is... very important to the British people and we're on the side of the British people,"" he said.
On Friday, the chancellor said immigration would be important for the UK economy in the years ahead, but the government still wanted to bring numbers down.
He said he wanted to improve skills ""at home"" to lower dependence on foreign workers.
Mr Danker praised some of the government's Autumn Statement, which saw Chancellor Jeremy Hunt set out £55bn of spending cuts and tax rises in a bid to curb rising prices while also protecting public services.
But he warned the UK must go further in order to solve years of stagnating growth and urged the government to make ""tough choices"" to help. 
UK's economy is performing worse than other major nations and is smaller than it was before the Covid pandemic.
government has said the country is already in recession, which is defined as when an economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row. It's a sign an economy is performing badly, with companies often making less money and unemployment rising.
Global factors are partly to blame, with energy and food prices soaring this year due to the war in Ukraine and Covid.
But the UK also faces significant labour supply challenges due to it being more difficult for small businesses to trade with Europe or recruit workers due to Brexit, which ended freedom of movement for EU citizens coming to the UK and vice versa.
According to figures from the ONS, net migration to the UK was estimated to be about 239,000 in the year ending June 2021, a slight fall from the previous year's figure of 260,000. The figure was driven by immigration from non-EU countries.
Last month a survey by the CBI, which represents 190,000 UK businesses, said almost three-quarters of UK companies had suffered from labour shortages in the past year and nearly half surveyed wanted the government to grant temporary visas for roles that were in ""obvious shortage"".
f retailer Next has urged the government to let more foreign workers into the UK to ease labour shortages.
Lord Wolfson, who was a prominent advocate of Brexit, said the UK's current immigration policy was crippling economic growth.
government has introduced a skilled worker visa scheme for some occupations facing shortages. It also has a seasonal workers scheme to cover jobs such as fruit pickers, and a health and care visa for medical staff.
Mr Danker said people might be ""arguing against immigration but it's the only thing that's increased the potential growth of our economy since March"".
""Growth is a precondition to a stable society. Without growth the NHS gets worse, not better. People's lives get worse, not better. And we lack the resources we need to transform ourselves to a zero-carbon world,"" he said.
""Yet Britain's had 15 years of low growth and flatlining productivity. We can't afford a repeat.""
Mr Danker also called for trading regulations to be reformed, saying politicians could no longer blame EU rules. 
""The biggest regulatory barriers facing businesses today are based on British laws, created by a British Parliament, and administered by British regulators,"" he said.

technology	Meta threatens to remove US news content if new law passes	"Meta has threatened to remove news content from Facebook in the US.
It objects to a new law that would give news organisations greater power to negotiate fees for content shared on Facebook. 
A similar law, passed in Australia, led to news on Facebook being briefly suspended last year.
Meta claims their platform, in fact, provides increased traffic to struggling news outlets. 
It says publishers put their content on Facebook because ""it benefits their bottom line.""
gislation, known as the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA) was introduced in Congress by Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and has bipartisan support. 
It would give publishers and broadcasters greater powers to collectively bargain with social media companies for a larger share of ad revenue. 
Media companies argue that Meta generates huge sums of money from news articles shared on the platform. 
Local news in particular struggled during the pandemic, as Meta made huge profits. 
However Meta argues that this narrative is wrong. Instead, it says, Meta drives traffic to news sources. 
Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said: ""If Congress passes an ill-considered journalism bill as part of national security legislation, we will be forced to consider removing news from our platform altogether"". 
Meta also argues that sharing news on Facebook accounts for only a fraction of its revenue. 
A similar Australian law, which took effect in March 2021, led to a brief shutdown of Facebook news feeds in the country. 
mpany quickly reversed the decision after wide-ranging criticism - brokering a deal with the Australian government. 
In a statement about Australia's proposed law last year, a spokesperson for Meta said, ""for Facebook, the business gain from news is minimal. News makes up less than 4% of the content people see in their News Feed."" 
US legislation is part of a larger set of laws aimed at tackling the dominance of Big Tech.
Supporters of the JCPA say social media will become America's ""de facto local newspapers"" if the act doesn't pass.
Matt Stoller, Director of Research at the American Economic Liberties Project, said media outlets were being ""eaten alive"" by Meta. 
""Meta's efforts to blackmail Congress prove again why this monopoly is a threat to democracies worldwide,"" he said. "	/news/technology-63869013
technology	Haworth: 'Imposing' phone mast for historic village refused	"A 5G phone mast will not be allowed to be built in a West Yorkshire village because it would add an ""imposing modern element.""
CK Hutchinson Networks submitted plans to Bradford Council for a 60ft (18m) mast on Vale Mill Road, Haworth.
But Bradford Council has rejected the application, saying it would have a ""deleterious impact on the living conditions of nearby residents"". 
It would be ""overbearing"" and would ""dominate the area"", the council said.
Proposals put forward by CK Hutchinson Networks said the mast would fill a 5G ""coverage hole"" in the village.
Haworth, Cross Roads and Stanbury Parish Council had initially opposed the plan, saying the location, on a residential street, was ""wholly inappropriate for such equipment.""
mpany argued the mast was needed to provide good 5G signal in Haworth, and said there were already other elements of street furniture such as lampposts on the street.
But planning officers said the proposal would add an ""imposing modern element which would be visually jarring and detrimental to the character of the area"".
Local Democracy Reporting Service said officers had acknowledged there was a ""coverage hole"" in the location and agreed the pole would have extended 5G service across the area.
However, they said the ""siting and appearance of the mast"" would cause ""unacceptable harm to the visual amenity of the locality.""

business	Persil advert banned for misleading green claims	"Unilever's advert for one of its laundry detergents, Persil, has been banned for being misleading about its environmental benefits.
rt said Persil was ""kinder to our planet"", and featured children picking up litter on a beach.
Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the advert's claim was unsubstantiated. 
Unilever, which owns brands including Hellmann's and Dove, said it is ""disappointed"" with the result. 
It follows a crackdown by the ASA on ""greenwashing"" - claims made by firms branding products as eco-friendly, green or sustainable. 
In the banned television advert, beaches are shown full of litter and then children are shown picking up the rubbish.  
A voiceover said: ""For real change we all need to roll up our sleeves and get dirty"". 
xt on the screen stating that the product ""removes stains at 30C"" is shown, with the Persil bottle, which the advert states is made with 50% recycled plastic. 
""Tough on stains and kinder to our planet,"" the voiceover adds. 
A viewer complained to the watchdog that Persil's claims of being ""kinder"" to the planet were unsubstantiated.  
regulator upheld the complaint and said that the claims could only be justified if the product provides an environmental benefit over other similar products. 
""Although we acknowledged Persil were undertaking actions to reduce the environmental impact of their products, we had not seen evidence or analysis to demonstrate the overall environmental impact of the featured liquid detergents over their full-life cycles, compared with Persil's own previous products or other products, in support of the claim 'kinder to our planet'"", the ASA said. 
Unilever countered that the advert showed how its liquid detergent was ""kinder"" to the planet because it saved energy by cleaning in fast washes and at lower temperatures. It also said it was ""kinder"" because the product used recycled plastic.
A spokesperson for Unilever told the BBC that is was ""disappointed"" with the ASA's result.
""We are committed to making on-going improvements to all our products to make them more sustainable and will continue to look at how we can share this with our shoppers"", Unilever said.
ASA banned the advert because it concluded that the basis of the claim ""kinder to our planet"" had not been made clear.
regulator also said the ad featured ""various strands of messaging"" about Persil's wider environmental initiatives including encouraging people to ""personally take action to care for the environment"", and showing children collecting plastic litter. 
""In the context of the entire ad with several messages relating to environmental issues, we considered the meaning and basis of the claim ""kinder to our planet"" was unclear,"" the ASA said. 
""Additionally, in the absence of evidence demonstrating that the full-life cycle of the product had a lesser environmental impact compared to a previous formulation, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead,"" a spokesperson from the ASA added. "	/news/business-62726666
entertainment	Isle of Wight film studio plan revealed	"A new film and television studio is to be built on the Isle of Wight.
Medina Studios Ltd will construct the complex on the banks of the Medina River in East Cowes, after it was recommended at an Isle of Wight cabinet meeting on Thursday.
It said the facility would have four sound stages totalling 70,000 sq ft (21,336 sq m) and be the island's ""first screen-based media hub"".
Business cabinet member Julie Jones-Evans called it a ""game changer"".
She said it would lead to ""high-quality creative jobs at the leading edge of this evolving and fast-growing sector"".
Media Studios Ltd said it would benefit from ""copious amounts of filming locations on its doorstep"", as it was ""nestled amongst woodland, clifftops, beaches, historic villages [and] period houses"".
Duncan Heath, speaking on behalf of the company, said: ""I've been in this business a long time and been lucky enough to be involved with some of the largest feature and television productions. 
""But I have to say this is one of the most exciting projects I've ever been involved with"".
David Godfrey, who helped design the studios, said they would ""attract a variety of productions who wish to base themselves on the island"". 
According to the cabinet report the council purchased the site in 2018 in order to ""secure a major employment development site for the benefit of the island"".
It will be based at the former Kingston Marine Park, which has been vacant for more than 10 years.
report said the ""positive effects of the proposals"" would ""ripple across all areas of the island, offering wide-ranging island business opportunities, as well as direct employment on site and on location"".
It also described it as a ""one off"" opportunity.
""It is considered unlikely that other better qualified people in the industry have been looking to travel to the island to build/develop a similar project speculatively,"" it said.
