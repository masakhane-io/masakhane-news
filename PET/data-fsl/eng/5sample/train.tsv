politics	Hythe Tory councillor resigns over far-right links	"A Tory councillor has quit after fresh evidence emerged over his links to a far-right organisation.
Andy Weatherhead had already been suspended by his local party in Kent after it emerged he used to be a member of the New British Union (NBU).
Hythe West councillor now says he is stepping down as a member on Kent County Council (KCC).
It comes as the BBC uncovered an interview in 2014 which apparently shows the extent of his NBU links.
Mr Weatherhead confirmed he gave the interview, but denied he was NBU policy officer, the term used by the interviewer to introduce him.
He gave the interview to an online radio station called the American Nationalist Network under the pseudonym Andrew Blackhouse.
In the recording, he is heard saying: ""I've always been an admirer of fascism. I've always been an admirer of Benito Mussolini and Sir Oswald Mosley, and last year I was trawling through the internet as one does and came across the New British Union and I thought 'hello, this sounds like right up my street', so I contacted them.""
He also refers to his work for the NBU as ""fleshing out policies"".
Mr Weatherhead apologised in a statement given to the BBC and said: ""It was not my intent to cause harm or offend. It is in the past. I completely and utterly reject anything to do with fascism.""
He said he had not heard from or seen NBU leader Gary Raikes since 2014.
He also claimed that when he had talked about ""fleshing out policies"" in the interview, this meant ""adding punctuation"".
Mr Weatherhead said the policies themselves had been written by the British Union in the 1930s.
Last week, after he was suspended by Folkestone and Hythe Conservatives, he said the NBU had not been a registered political party, had no defined membership and his links with the group were ""in the spirit of education and curiosity"".
He said after 2014 he had re-entered mainstream politics and turned his back on fringe politics ""having seen it for what it truly was"".
r of KCC, Roger Gough, said he welcomed Andy Weatherhead's resignation as a councillor.
He said: ""The views and associations reported have no place in the Kent County Council Conservative group.""

business	New shared banking hubs to open in 13 more places	"Another 13 locations have been earmarked for shared banking hubs in areas where the last branch has closed.
A swathe of branch closures have raised concerns about access to cash for those who need it, and difficulties for small businesses trying to deposit takings.
r areas were previously identified, but the doors have yet to open on any of their new hubs.
Ministers have prepared legislation to ensure people can access cash locally, while experts say hubs are not enough.
""Cash is disappearing at a frightening rate, and so are ATMs and branches and it is not acceptable to leave communities without access to cash,"" John Howells, chief executive of Link - which is the biggest interbank network in the UK - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""There is real investment and effort going in by the banks now…But now that pace needs to be picked up,"" he added.
At these hubs, customers of any bank can access their accounts, deposit cash and cheques, and withdraw money at any time. Trickier enquiries are dealt with by a representative from one of each of the major banks who each visit once a week.
Among the 13 new proposed banking hub sites, four are in Scotland and, for the first time, one is in Northern Ireland, in Kilkeel.
will be in Brechin in Angus, Forres in Moray, Carluke in Lanarkshire, Kirkcudbright in Dumfries and Galloway, Axminster in Devon, Barton-upon-Humber in Lincolnshire, Lutterworth in Leicestershire, Royal Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire, Cheadle in Staffordshire, Belper in Derbyshire, Maryport in Cumbria, Hornsea in Yorkshire, and also in Kilkeel.
BBC visited a prototype shared banking hub in Rochford, Essex, and was told it had been ""a lifeline"" for many people living in the area after the last branch in town closed.
Running costs are the same as a small branch, but are shared between different banking groups that use it.
Natalie Ceeney, who chairs the Cash Action Group which is overseeing the project, said: ""Cash still matters hugely to millions of people across the UK and with the cost-of-living crisis biting, more and more people are turning to cash as a way of budgeting effectively. Banking Hubs are an important part of the solution.""
Each time a core banking service such as a cash machine or bank branch is closed, an assessment is carried out by Link - the organisation which currently oversees the UK's ATM network.
review studies the cash needs of the community, such as how easy it is to travel to the nearest alternative service, as well as the demographics and vulnerability of local residents. The criteria are set by a group of banks and consumer representatives.
fied as part of that work.
However, it can take months for these new hubs to open. As well as finding a suitable premise, often changes are needed to ensure it is fully accessible and secure enough for banking services.
re has been some criticism that services have not yet started in any of the previously-announced locations for banking hubs, apart from the two trial premises in Rochford and Cambuslang, in Scotland.
Ron Delnevo, a business consultant with years of experience in the ATM industry, said that ""the promised hubs don't even scratch the surface in terms of satisfying the banking needs of the UK"".
Mark Aldred, of banking technology company Auriga, said: ""As we go into a cost of living crisis that's hitting households and businesses alike, these shared hubs are good on paper but could go further and faster.""
A Financial Conduct Authority spokesperson said: ""Firms need to pick up the pace and deliver more banking hubs. We expect this to be done as a priority.
""Banks and building societies must treat their customers fairly and provide alternatives to branches where needed. Banking hubs are one of a range of tools they can use to ensure communities have easy access to bank services and cash.""
In addition to the hubs, withdrawal and deposit machines - which are unstaffed but can allow businesses to cash in their takings - will be placed in libraries and community centres and available during their opening hours.
will be in Swanley and Faversham, both in Kent, Holywood in County Down, Shanklin on the Isle of Wight, Atherstone in Warwickshire, Billericay and Dunmow, both in Essex, Bourne in Lincolnshire, Holyhead on Anglesey, llfracombe in Devon, Swanage in Dorset, and Wallingford in Oxfordshire.
government has been planning to bring in new laws to ensure people only have to travel a relatively short distance to access cash withdrawal and deposit services.

technology	Optus: How a massive data breach has exposed Australia	"Last week, Australian telecommunications giant Optus revealed about 10 million customers - about 40% of the population - had personal data stolen in what it calls a cyber-attack.
Some experts say it may be the worst data breach in Australia's history.
But this week has seen more dramatic and messy developments - including ransom threats, tense public exchanges and scrutiny over whether this constituted a ""hack"" at all.
It's also ignited critical questions about how Australia handles data and privacy.
Optus - a subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd - went public with the breach about 24 hours after it noticed suspicious activity on its network.
Australia's second-largest telecoms provider said current and former customers' data was stolen - including names, birthdates, home addresses, phone and email contacts, and passport and driving licence numbers. It stressed that payment details and account passwords were not compromised.
whose passport or licence numbers were taken - roughly 2.8 million people - are at a ""quite significant"" risk of identity theft and fraud, the government has since said.
Optus said it was investigating the breach and had notified police, financial institutions, and government regulators. The breach appears to have originated overseas, local media reported. 
In an emotional apology, Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin called it a ""sophisticated attack"", saying the company has very strong cybersecurity.
""Obviously, I am angry that there are people out there that want to do this to our customers, and I'm disappointed that we couldn't have prevented it,"" she said on Friday. 
Early on Saturday, an internet user published data samples on an online forum and demanded a ransom of $1m (A$1.5m; £938,000) in cryptocurrency from Optus.
mpany had a week to pay or the other stolen data would be sold off in batches, the person said.
Investigators are yet to verify the user's claims, but some experts quickly said the sample data - which contained about 100 records - appeared legitimate.
Sydney-based tech reporter Jeremy Kirk contacted the purported hacker and said the person gave him a detailed explanation of how they stole the data.
user contradicted Optus's claims the breach was ""sophisticated"", saying they pulled the data from a freely accessible software interface.
""No authenticate needed… All open to internet for any one to use,"" they said in a message, according to Kirk.
In another escalation on Tuesday, the person claiming to be the hacker released 10,000 customer records and reiterated the ransom deadline.
But just hours later, the user apologised - saying it had been a ""mistake"" - and deleted the previously posted data sets.
""Too many eyes. We will not sale [sic] data to anyone,"" they posted. ""Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this.""
rked speculation about whether Optus had paid the ransom - which the company denies - or whether the user had been spooked by the police investigation.
Adding to the problem, others on the forum had copied the now-deleted data sets, and continued to distribute them.
It also emerged some customers' Medicare details - government identification numbers that could provide access to medical records - had also been stolen, something Optus did not previously disclose. 
Late on Wednesday, the company said this had affected almost 37,000 Medicare cards.  
Optus has been inundated with messages from angry customers since last week. 
People have been warned to watch out for signs of identity theft and for opportunistic scammers, who are said to be already cashing in on the confusion. 
A class-action lawsuit could soon be filed against the company. ""This is potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history, both in terms of the number of affected people and the nature of the information disclosed,"" said Ben Zocco from Slater and Gordon Lawyers.
government has called the breach ""unprecedented"" and blamed Optus, saying it ""effectively left the window open"" for sensitive data to be stolen.
In an ABC television interview on Monday, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil was asked: ""You certainly don't seem to be buying the line from Optus that this was a sophisticated attack?""
""Well, it wasn't. So no,"" Ms O'Neil replied. The moment drew lots of attention online. 
Ms Bayer Rosmarin told News Corp Australia on Tuesday: ""We have multiple layers of protection. So it is not the case of having some sort of completely exposed APIs [software interfaces] sitting out there.
""I think most customers understand that we are not the villains,"" she said, adding Optus could not say more while the investigation was ongoing.
mpany has faced calls to cover the costs of replacement passport and driving licences, as people scramble to protect themselves.
reach highlights how much Australia lags behind other parts of the world on privacy and cyber issues, Ms O'Neil says.
""We are probably a decade behind… where we ought to be,"" she told the ABC.
Both sides of politics have traded blame on the issue. Opposition MPs have said the Labor government is ""asleep at the wheel"", but the government points out it was only elected in May after a decade of conservative rule.
Ms O'Neil pointed to two areas needing urgent reform.
She argues the government should be able to better penalise companies like Optus. In some countries, the company would have faced hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties but Australia's fine is capped at about $2m, she said.
She also wants to expand cyber-security laws that were introduced last year to include telecommunications companies.
""At the time, the telecommunications sector said: ""Don't worry about us - we're really good at cybersecurity. We'll do it without being regulated. I would say that this incident really calls that assertion into question.""
Security experts have also suggested reforming data retention laws so telecommunication companies don't have to keep sensitive information for so long. Ex-customers should also have the right to request companies delete their data, experts say.
Optus says it is required to keep identity data for six years under the current rules.
Other industry figures have argued consumers should be able to take companies that lose control of their information to court, instead of the industry regulator."	/news/world-australia-63056838
business	Mining firm Glencore pleads guilty to UK bribery charges	"A British subsidiary of the mining firm Glencore has pleaded guilty in a UK court to corruption offences for the second time in the last two months.  
It was accused of paying millions of dollars in bribes to secure access to crude oil in several African countries.  
Serious Fraud Office (SFO) found that bribes occurred from 2012 to 2016. 
It found that bribes of over $28m (£22.8m) were paid via the Swiss-based firm's employees and agents. 
ribery charges stated that the firm's aim was for officials to ""perform their functions improperly, or reward them for so doing, by unduly favouring Glencore Energy UK Limited in the allocation of crude oil cargoes, the dates crude oil would be lifted and the grades of crude oil allocated"".
mining giant has also pleaded guilty to corruption charges in the US and Brazil. 
Glencore expects to pay up to $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in fines but is currently making record profits. 
From sales of metals, minerals and agricultural produce, it says profits for the first half of the year will exceed $3bn (£2.4bn). 
A British subsidiary of the firm formally pleaded guilty on seven counts of bribery in connection with oil operations in Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast and South Sudan on Tuesday in Southwark Crown Court. 
SFO said Glencore attempted to secure access to oil and make illicit profit across its oil operations in the five countries. 
It also still faces investigations in Switzerland and the Netherlands. 
Last month, the firm agreed to a $1.1bn (£900m) settlement in the US over a scheme to bribe officials in seven countries during the course of a decade. 
It concerned the mining giant's operations in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela.
In May, when Glencore last pleaded guilty to seven counts of bribery, the SFO said it had exposed ""profit-driven bribery and corruption"" across Glencore Energy UK's oil operations in five African nations.
At the time, Glencore's chairman said ""unacceptable practices"" had taken place in relation to the bribery charges it pleaded guilty to at Westminster Magistrates' Court. 
mpany's agents and employees paid bribes worth more than $25m for preferential access to oil, with the approval of the company, between 2011 and 2016, the SFO said.
Spotlight on Corruption, a pressure group, said the charges were ""hugely significant"" but raised ""questions about the SFO's ambition as our elite corruption-busting agency"". 
NGO's legal researcher, Helen Taylor, explained that although Glencore is listed on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in Jersey, the SFO had ""only pursued"" the UK subsidiary's oil operations in a handful of African countries. 
""This is low-hanging fruit, given the staggering scale of corruption that has been uncovered in the company's global operations,"" she continued. 
""Until now, companies have got off lightly for corporate corruption, as liability has largely been confined to 'failure to prevent' bribery offences. 
""Glencore's guilty plea today should send a strong signal that companies will be held to account for the complicity of senior executives in corporate corruption.
""The reality is that bribery remains hidden in the shadows until brave whistle-blowers, investigative journalists and civil society bring corporate criminality into the light of public scrutiny,"" Ms Taylor added. 
Glencore is to be sentenced in a two-day hearing at the Southwark Crown Court in November."	/news/business-61857005
health	Nurses' strike: The young NHS workers who voted yes	"Nurses at some NHS trusts are expected to walk out later this year after voting in favour of striking.
Unions have said even new recruits were struggling to see a future in the NHS, with nurses struggling with workloads and rising prices not matching wages.
It will be the first UK-wide action by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in more than 100 years.
re's been criticism from some, with the government in England urging nurses to consider the impact on patients.
It will be a different picture across the UK - in England the turnout was too low in nearly half of trusts for action to take place.
But, nurses in every service in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted for action, and in Wales all but one health board did.
Student nurse Ellie McNicol only started her course at the University of Bristol last year but says she has already seen enough to know things need to change.
""Lots of mistakes are happening that shouldn't be due to staffing pressures,"" the 22-year-old told BBC Newsbeat.
""I've seen it firsthand. We get a lot of pressure put on us.""
Ellie was inspired to get into nursing after caring for her brother when he was in an accident a couple of years ago.
""If I didn't feel so strongly about wanting to help people I'd consider dropping out,"" Ellie says.
""I knew it was going to be hard. It's common knowledge that nurses don't get half of what they deserve.""
As a student, she doesn't get paid for her time working on wards but receives a bursary to help with her travel costs. 
walkout will involve Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members in more than half of hospitals and community teams, but emergency care will still be staffed.
government in England pointed out it had given a pay rise in line with what had been recommended by the independent NHS Pay Review body.
England Health Secretary Steve Barclay said he ""deeply regretted"" that some union members had voted for action, adding the ""priority is keeping patients safe during any strikes"".
Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health managers, urged the government and RCN to get back to the negotiating table.
""The last thing anyone wants is a 'war of attrition' playing out over many months.""
Ellie understands the concerns, but says: ""If nurses feel like their only option is to strike, it must be something really big.
""When it's Royal Mail, it's just people's post, not their lives on the line,"" she says. 
With the cost of living increasing, she argues nurses have to look after themselves as much as they look after others.
Paediatric nurse Jessie Collins works in schools and A&E and also voted in favour of strike action.
""It's about creating a work culture that retains staff,"" she says. 
""As nurses, it's really hard not to be able to deliver the care you want to.""
29-year-old says the strikes are also to ""highlight the fact we aren't paid in line with what we think we're worth and the profession is worth"".
""And it's about trying to make it a better place, not just for us, but for our patients as well."" 
She describes being a nurse as ""really rewarding"", but says the job ""has to be a place that is safe"".
""There is a massive staffing crisis. In the long-term, it's going to be quite catastrophic, unless they do something,"" she says.
And she feels the short-term impact of striking has ""nothing on the impact on patient care over the past few years"".
""It's not something we ever imagined we would do. And it's for the benefit of our patients in the long run.""
Luke, who works in Wales, says he voted to strike after six years in the job.
""The volume of work and the level of responsibility is unbelievable for the money you're on,"" says Luke, who didn't want to share his full name.
He's seen his outgoings shoot up by £400 a month, and says he's having to pick up extra weekend shifts to make ends meet. 
""How is frozen pay going to help me deal with that?"" he asks. ""My job is now unaffordable.""
Although high numbers of nurses are choosing to leave the profession, Luke says he is so passionate about his career he would not consider quitting.
""None of us are in this for the money,"" he says. ""This is not a career you go in to to get rich.
""It's not just a job you do - you give a piece of yourself to it.""
Choosing to strike was a ""preventative measure"", he says, adding the quality of care was already slipping.
""It really is life and death,"" he says. 
""Patients are already suffering because we're struggling to give them the care they need and deserve.""
xact information for when strike action will occur has not yet been announced.

health	Parkinson's Disease: Playing the trombone 'raises mojo'	"A shock diagnosis in 2016 of Parkinson's Disease for Colin Nicholls put him at ""rock bottom"", forcing him to retire from Thames Valley police and his work as a chaplain at Woodhill prison.
Passionate about playing the trombone he thought he had lost that too - but with the encouragement of his wife, Janet, he recently picked up the instrument again and found it hugely beneficial to his mental health.
""I've got one thing,"" Mr Nicholls told BBC Look East, ""one thing which has always been important to me throughout my whole life, and I've got that back.""

entertainment	Children In Need: 'Wheelchair basketball is life changing'	"""Basketball has taught me I don't need to be embarrassed about my disability.""
Kai Frisby, who has cerebral palsy, began going to the local basketball club for fun but has gained valuable confidence - and plays for Wales.
As a full-time wheelchair user, the 16-year-old from Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, said it gave him the chance to ""look people in the eye again"".
r he cycled alongside BBC presenter Matt Baker as part of the Children in Need rickshaw relay.
He said it felt ""incredible"" to give back to a charity which has helped him and his club so much.
Kai, who ""really struggled"" with his social skills before joining  Aberystwyth Wheelchair Basketball, said being part of a team has been ""life changing"".
He joined the club when he was seven and his team mates are both disabled and able bodied, including his dad Danny and 12-year-old sister.
""I've been really lucky to be able to find who I really am and been able to experience all these things and that was the main reason for me for me to get involved because there are a lot of kids out there who haven't had that chance,"" he said.
""Given my circumstances I came in, not really exercising, I had low self-esteem and not really talking to anyone and I met this whole community that I didn't know existed up until that point and they just welcomed me into the family and showed me that despite being in a chair it is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me.
""It gives me a chance to see someone eye to eye, as before I was looking at someone's stomach.
""It is a great chance to see peers at the same level as someone who was always at a disadvantage in physical activities like school PE lessons.""
Kai has ""made friendships here that are going to last a lifetime"" at the club and said it taught him to see his disability in a positive way.
""Learning to socialise with other people, the communication skills you learn in basketball are vital for team success but really applicable in life because now I am not afraid to go have a conversation with people at the risk of them judging me for my disability.
""I'm not afraid of that any more.""
He argues that being in a wheelchair has meant he has experienced things he could have never dreamed of thanks to the club.
He has represented Wales three times, his team just missing out on the Commonwealth Games qualifiers.
""After playing in the Welsh vest for the first time I thought I might as well try and keep it going,"" he said.
""You just get an immense sense of pride and you've got home crowds cheering you on.
""I think that is the best thing about Wales we are a small country but we get the best support and you always know when Wales are in the house.""
Kai was one of five across the UK selected to take in the rickshaw relay. He jumped at the opportunity to support it and to ""say thank you"" to the charity which helps fund the club.
His challenge was to ride from Plascrug Leisure Centre to Capel Bangor and return to Aberystwyth sea front.
""It was an absolutely unforgettable experience,"" he said.
""We had a fantastic team and can't thank them enough for everything they did and it was really nice to cycle through my home town for 12 miles in the areas I have grown up in and it was great to see overwhelming support for the challenge and all the people who came out cheering you on and donating.""
He described Matt Baker as a ""lovely chap"" who ""was just making sure I had a great time"".
""It was effectively a two-hour chat with Matt Baker - as I like to call it, it was having a lot of fun for two-and-a-half hours"". 
Kai was nominated to ride the rickshaw by the head coach of the club Lee Coulson, who said seeing him take part was ""absolutely amazing"".
""We knew he was going to smash it and he went out there and he did the job, but he was very humble with the whole experience,"" he said.
""He just wanted to give his thanks back to the club and to Children In Need and he went out there and he did just that.""
ub receives funding from Children In Need as an ""absolute lifeline"" to help with things such as purchasing equipment, running sessions and coaching.
""This club wouldn't be where it is today without the support of Children In Need,"" he said.
""Aberystwyth Basketball Club is an inclusive sports club so we invite everybody along and nobody is excluded,"" said Mr Coulson.
""What we try and do in the club is made sure that it's a fun place, but also they learn something, those important life skills that they need.
""The social side of the club is one of the most important things that we focus on: building relationships, making friends but learning about discipline, respect things that you'd need to take forward in life to help them move forward when they leave the club.
""Whether it's now or in 10 or 20 years' time, we want people to come out and have a go and learn what it is to be inclusive and looking down the line have a senior team in the league - but nothing too serious.
""It's got to be about the enjoyment of the game.""
Matt Baker called Kai a ""really impressive young person"".
""He has never let the fact that he is in a wheelchair hold him back from doing anything.
""Even when he turned up at school and it wasn't as accessible as it could be, that didn't hold him back and he influenced his school to make changes so it would be accessible for those with disabilities.
""He spends his spare time doing so many things to benefit other people. He really is a remarkable teenager and it was an absolute pleasure to ride alongside him during the challenge.
""It was amazing to visit the project that's supported him - Aberystwyth Wheelchair Basketball and just seeing so many of his friends, family and the community of Aberystwyth come out to cheer him on as he took on this remarkable challenge was really inspiring.""

business	Plan to cut energy bills if you avoid peak-time use	"Households could get discounts on electricity bills if they use less energy at peak times.
National Grid hopes to roll out a scheme where people can save cash if they avoid high-power activities, such as cooking or charging electric cars, when demand is high.
move follows a trial where Octopus Energy offered incentives for 100,000 customers who reduced consumption.
National Grid is asking all suppliers for feedback on its plans.
mpany said the scheme was ""not about energy rationing"", despite fears over energy supplies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine affected oil and gas supplies to Europe.
A spokesman told the BBC the move was to ""create flexibility"" in its network and was part of longer-term plans to not add to the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
He added it ""should not have a negative impact"" on consumers as its aim was to balance the power grid at times of the year when heating and lighting causes overall electricity demand to be higher.
Last week, National Grid ESO hosted a webinar with energy suppliers to ask and understand how feasible its proposals would be if it rolled out the scheme country-wide, following its trial with Octopus Energy in February.
It is understood a scheme could be established across suitable homes in Britain within months if energy firms agree.
mes, which first reported the story, said it had seen estimates that households, which typically pay 28.34p for each kilowatt-hour of electricity they use, could potentially be paid as much as £6 for each kilowatt-hour that they avoid using at peak times.
way customers would redeem savings has not been established, but Octopus Energy said its consumers received credit on their energy accounts and also had a ""self-refund option"" where they could get cash transferred to their bank accounts.
Prices overall are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years, with UK inflation at 9.1%, the highest level since March 1982, biting into household budgets.
Changes to the energy price cap meant typical energy bills rose by an unprecedented £700-a-year in April, and are due to rise by even more in October. 
Energy supplier Octopus Energy, which trialled National Grid's proposals, said smart meter customers who reduced their consumption on evenings when demand is highest manged to save cash.
It said consumers on average saved 23p per each two-hour trial window, but some participants saved up to £4.35. 
""However, savings over winter could potentially be much higher if this becomes a real service, but of course this depends on how much National Grid would pay households per kWh,"" the company said.
Greg Jackson, chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy said traditionally at times when demand was high, National Grid would pay large companies to reduce their usage, or pay for ""diesel generators to switch on to produce electricity"".
He said the new plan, which he hopes will be in place this winter, wasn't ""life changing stuff"", but would offer households a chance to get paid if they reduced demand on the network.
""When some people take part in these turn downs, it reduces the price for them but actually by making the system more efficient, it reduces it for everyone.
""These small amounts add up,"" he said.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has fuelled a massive rise in energy bills and concerns over energy security.
Energy firms have been asked to delay the closure of UK coal-fired power plants by the government, which has said it is exploring ""a wide range of options to further bolster our energy security and domestic supply"".
Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng wrote to EDF, Drax and Uniper this month to ask that they temporarily extend the operation of the coal plants, which are used for back-up generation.
UK gets very little of its power from coal, but generates a lot of electricity from gas.
National Grid said its hoped the new scheme would help to avoid the need to burn more coal for energy.
Reducing your energy bill a little by switching on appliances at a ""cheaper"" time of day is not, as Octopus boss Greg Jackson says, life changing. Nor is it a new idea.
But any way to keep costs down will be looked at with interest by consumers who are only seeing their bill go one way at the moment - and that's up.
It has long been the selling point of smart meters, that this kind of thing is made easier to monitor and reward when suppliers have a minute-by-record of your energy use.
But there will be some safety concerns. For example, a fire caused by a faulty washing machine or tumble dryer is more of a risk to life if it occurs in the middle of the night, when everyone at home is upstairs asleep, than it would during the day."	/news/business-61949246
health	Desperate NHS pays up to £2,500 for nursing shifts	"NHS bosses are increasingly paying premium rates for agency staff to plug holes in rotas, the BBC has found.
Spending in this area rose by 20% last year to hit £3bn in England.
For many shifts, bosses have been so short-staffed they have been willing to breach the government pay caps for these agency workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
Separate data supplied by Labour showed some NHS trusts had paid as much as £2,500 to fill shifts. 
Out of 60 responses from trusts, 10 reported the most expensive shift cost over £2,000, and for another 13 it was between £1,000-2,000.
BBC has also seen evidence of aggressive marketing by agencies - which take a cut of the shift pay. One boasted it is the ""best"" time to try it, because the fees that can be commanded are increasing.
Although paying out £2,500 for one nursing shift may not be the norm - it shows how much supply shortages can cost the NHS.
Saffron Cordery, interim chief executive of NHS Providers which represent trusts in England, said: ""Trust leaders consistently raise concerns about sky-high agency costs. 
""They're already facing enormous financial pressures with the impact of inflation and energy costs, and the government's failure to fully fund staff pay awards.
""They are doing all they can to minimise agency spend. But safety must always come first.""
government said the NHS faced some exceptional pressures last year, but it expected spending on agency staff to fall in the future.
BBC spoke to one cancer doctor who was offered work for £130 an hour - well above the cap for his role - and described the fees available as ""astonishing"" and a reflection of ""desperation by management"".
Dr James Barson qualified four years ago. But instead of taking the traditional junior doctor route, he now solely focuses on agency work in hospitals across Lincolnshire.
reason? Pay and the flexibility. He can earn more than twice what he would get paid if he was on the NHS payroll, without the need to commit to nights and weekends.
""Being a junior doctor is very difficult, very demanding. Being a locum I can work nine to five, Monday to Friday and take days off that are entirely my decision."" 
He says he would not consider taking a shift for less than the market rate of £50 to £60 an hour.
But he says there are downsides to agency work, including lack of holiday and sickness pay, as well as ""not always feeling a welcome part of the team"".
Agency pay rates are capped at 55% above what a normal employee would receive. 
But the BBC investigation found for nearly nine in 10 agency shifts for doctors and dentists, and four in 10 for nurses the caps were exceeded last year.
NHS bosses can only do this if there is a significant risk to patient safety.
rise in 2021-22 comes after the NHS had appeared to get on top of the use of agency work following a government crackdown in 2015-16 when the cap was introduced.
Ministers set the NHS the task of moving away from agency work, encouraging the use of NHS staff banks, where employees do overtime.
After six years, during which spending had been curbed, the £500m jump has caused concern.
BBC used a combination of Freedom of Information requests to individual NHS services, as well as analysing published data, to find out what was going on with agency spending, as well as using data obtained by Labour.
About six in 10 trusts provided information on their own levels of spending. It showed huge variation, with some services spending less than 1% of their staff budget on agency workers and others in excess of 11%.
Previously reported figures suggest spending also appears to be rising in other parts of the UK. In Scotland it has doubled in the past year, while in Wales it has risen by more than 40%. 
In Northern Ireland, it is four times higher than it was three years ago.
Colchester Hospital is just one of many services which is increasingly relying on agency workers.
Emergency department matron Andy Seale says it is a constant battle making sure there are enough staff available.
""Sometimes you can spend a couple of hours every day trying to sort rotas out.""
It is a picture that is repeated across the hospital and the other sites that are part of the East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Trust. 
Chief executive Nick Hulme says a combination of factors is playing a role, including the need to open extra wards to cope with rising demand, as well as staffing shortages. 
Some people are even leaving their jobs, only to return later as agency workers. 
He says while many agency workers do fantastic work on the wards, he would still prefer to be able to use his own staff. ""We know that's best for patient care, best for patient experience. Agency staff require more supervision and tasks such as handovers take longer."" 
He acknowledges it is not the best use of taxpayer money, but says he has no choice. ""Quality and safety of care is always going to be the priority,"" he adds.
Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at the King's Fund think tank, said the NHS was caught in a ""vicious cycle"". 
He said a combination of staffing shortages, Covid sickness absences and rising demands was driving the increase in reliance on agency workers.
""I don't think what is happening is a surprise. There will always be some reliance on temporary staff, but you want to minimise it.""
And Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting called it an ""infuriating"" use of money.
""Taxpayers are picking up the bill for the Conservatives' failure to train enough doctors and nurses.""
He said Labour would train the doctors and nurses the NHS needs by abolishing the non-dom tax status, where UK residents whose permanent home is elsewhere may not have to pay UK tax on foreign income.
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the past year had seen some exceptional workforce pressures, and a drive to get services back to normal following the pandemic.
But she said the expectation was that spending would be reduced by at least 10% this year.
""We have a clear policy to reduce agency spend through capping the hourly pay of agency and temporary staff, ensuring they are only hired through approved NHS agreements to ensure value for money, and prioritising NHS staff.""
She said the government was in the process of developing a workforce plan that would help ensure the health service had the staff it needed in the future.
Currently one in 10 NHS posts is vacant.

roposal, which was passed last week by the city's legislators, the board of supervisors, would have allowed police to access robots that can kill.
It had faced fierce criticism from civil liberties groups.
After voting unanimously to pause the proposal on Tuesday, the board sent the issue to committee for further review.

Dr Catherine Connolly, from the group Stop Killer Robots, told the BBC the move was a ""slippery slope"" that could distance humans from killing. 
Protesters and several dissenting board members gathered on the steps of city hall to call for the city to reverse its decision.
In a secondary vote, usually reserved to rubber-stamp board decisions, they decided to overturn their vote.

Police have argued that the robots would only be used in extreme circumstances.

entertainment	Black Americans' complex response to Harry and Meghan's Netflix series	"WATCH: A clip from the first episode of the Harry and Meghan Netflix series
Bryndis Roberts watched the Harry & Meghan documentary series with tears in her eyes. 
An avid fan of the royals since the days of Princess Diana, she said she cried watching the family being hounded by the tabloids and Prince Harry describing how he and his brother, Prince William, have grown apart.  
But as a 65-year-old black woman who grew up in the segregated American South, Roberts said it was the frank discussions around race and racism that resonated with her most.  
She said she recognised some of her own experiences in Meghan's admission that she felt she constantly had to prove herself and would never be good enough.  
""I've been called an angry black woman, and all of the tropes that are used to demean and dehumanise black women, and so I certainly empathised and sympathised with [the duchess],"" she said. 
Race was a core theme of the six-part series, but not in the way many had anticipated.  
re were no new revelations about Meghan's explosive allegation in her Oprah Winfrey interview that an unnamed member of the royal family had commented on how ""dark"" their baby's skin would be.  
Instead, the couple used the Netflix show to argue that Meghan's biracial heritage was often an underlying factor in what they described as a relentless tabloid campaign against her - and more obviously in the racist abuse she suffered online.  
It's a narrative that Roberts recognises. Back in 2018, she helped popularise the hashtag #SussexSquad when her timeline was flooded with racist comments about Meghan after the royal wedding. The trend quickly amassed a following from men and women around the world - predominately people of colour - who wanted to use social media to support the duchess and her family instead of tearing them down. 
""One of the things about dog whistles is that if you've not experienced the racism, or if you've not been the victim of it, then you don't recognise it,"" Roberts said. ""What may seem innocent to someone else, you can see, no that's not meant to be innocent at all."" 
In the series, Prince Harry revealed that one of the first reactions he saw to the announcement of his son Archie's birth was a tweet from Danny Baker, a former BBC presenter, who posted a picture of a couple holding hands with a chimp.  
""At the top it said, 'Royal baby leaving the hospital'. That was one of the first things I saw,"" Prince Harry said. Mr Baker apologised and was later fired.  
American tech entrepreneur Christopher Bouzy told the BBC that the couple's children were regularly compared to monkeys in online attacks, with the N-word frequently used against Meghan.  
Bouzy featured in the series after his company, Bot Sentinel, found that a small but powerful number of anti-Meghan accounts were responsible for much of the hateful content on Twitter. 
""This mimics something out of a Russian troll farm,"" Bouzy said. ""I'm not saying there aren't folks out there who just don't like her for whatever reason, but it's my opinion looking at the entire picture of these hate accounts that you can't look at that and come to the conclusion that this is not about race."" 
RS Locke, an American royal watcher and commentator, claimed the vitriol against Meghan was rooted in misogynoir, a hatred for a person simply because they're black and a woman. The documentary series, she said, captured the dramatic shift in tone of media coverage that she'd witnessed in the years after the royal wedding. 
""The UK, much like the broader world, wants to see themselves as accepting and embracing this very diverse, modern couple,"" she said. But the backlash and racist abuse Meghan says she endured since showed just how far there was to go.   
""It's a tug-of-war between how we see ourselves, and who we are."" 
While many black Americans welcomed Harry and Meghan talking about racism - as well as difficult issues such as the legacy of slavery and colonialism - the duchess has also been criticised for saying she felt blindsided by the realities of living as a black woman.  
In the second episode of the series, Meghan grapples with what it was like growing up as a biracial woman in America. The duchess implies she was never discriminated against or ""treated like a black woman"" until she moved to the UK.  
Growing up, she explained, her mother never had ""the talk"" with her, referring to the frank discussion that many families are forced to have about the realities of racism, discrimination, and the challenges of being a person of colour in America.   
For some watching the series, that admission felt like a slap in the face.  
""I don't understand that, how was she raised by a whole black woman in America and then she says that her parents never talked to her about being black,"" one user posted on Twitter. ""We're supposed to see her as this black woman but she never related to us.""  
Others wanted the duchess to clarify if she had even identified as a black woman before marrying Prince Harry. 
Roberts said she felt that statement showed that colourism is still an issue in the United States and that she didn't want to perpetuate that prejudice by blaming the duchess for having different life experiences than she did growing up with a darker complexion.    
Many online agreed with her.  
""It's Meghan realising being allowed in doesn't necessarily mean acceptance. Diversity is not necessarily inclusion,"" one user tweeted. ""It's a moment most Black people have and it's time to choose is my seat at the table worth the pain and humiliation."" 
Roberts said watching Harry and Meghan present their version of what happened - and what went wrong - was especially emotional because it felt like a missed opportunity for the royal family. 
""It's just tragic that the institution didn't realise what jewels they had in Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan and they didn't say, 'These two people can reach members of the British public and the Commonwealth that the rest of us cannot reach,'"" she said. "	/news/world-us-canada-64009156
technology	How flowers are 'put to sleep' for long sea voyages	"Workers in heavy coats shift boxes of flowers from a cold store into a refrigerated container. Once packed, these blooms will travel hundreds of miles by road, in a special 'controlled atmosphere' container from Nairobi to the coast.
On arrival at Kenya's biggest seaport, Mombasa, the container is loaded onto a ship for a voyage to Europe of around 30 days. Despite their lengthy journey, they will still be sold to European shoppers with a vase-life of about a week.
So, how is this possible?
""The flowers will be kept at a temperature of 0.5 degrees celsius throughout the journey,"" says Elizabeth Kimani, the manager of quality and standards at Sian Flowers.
As well as controlling the temperature, the atmosphere system in the container reduces the oxygen level from 20% to 4%, while increasing the carbon dioxide level from 0.4% to 4%. 
gy is all part of the elaborate process of preserving the blooms for as long as possible. 
""Through this [system] you stop all activity in the flowers that, as a result, go into dormancy,"" Ms Kimani says, explaining that the flowers are put to sleep.
A sophisticated tracking system allows staff from the shipping company to monitor the temperature, oxygen and CO2 levels throughout the journey.
But flowers destined for such a long voyage need extra attention to prepare them, as soon as they are picked.
""We harvest them early in the morning, when it's still cool and they will be the first to go into the cold room,"" explains Linda Murungi from grower, Sian Flowers.
Freshly-harvested roses, for instance, are then dipped into a chemical mixture to protect them from the fungus, botrytis.
After that, the stems are put into buckets to absorb a hydration solution so they can survive the thirty days without water. They are also put in a solution that curbs the growth hormone, ethylene, which causes the ageing of the flowers.
Once that process is completed, the flowers are then packed into cartons with holes in the top and bottom, which allow air from the container's system to circulate.
Kenya has become one of the world's biggest flower exporters thanks to its equatorial location, high altitudes and relatively cheap labour, it competes for dominance in the market with Colombia and Ecuador.
For years, the two Latin American countries have been exporting about 10% of their flowers by sea freight to North America and Europe.
As these flowers are at sea for a much shorter period of time, firms exporting from Latin America do not use controlled atmosphere, or post-harvest treatments. 
Kenyan exporters however, have to be extra-careful. There is no direct shipping route in to Europe, instead, containers are transferred in the Middle East from smaller vessels to much larger ones.
""All processes around sea freight require extreme precision - there's no room for shortcuts,"" says Jeroen van der Hulst, chief executive at consulting company, FlowerWatch. ""One mistake and your flowers might arrive as compost in Europe."" 
Kenyan flowers' complex journey involves a higher risk of delay, as containers occasionally miss their transfer window.
rt of Mombasa has also been known for delays and bureaucracy. Another challenge is it also lacks a so-called 'green line' for perishable products - flowers have to queue up with all the other containers.
Due to these challenges, Kenya's flower farmers have, in the past, been wary of sea freight preferring to transport their flowers by air but shifted during the pandemic.
farmers saw the price of air freight soar from around $1.80 per kilo, in January 2020, to around $2.80 per kilo in June 2022, according to Harm-Jan Mostert commercial manager for Africa at Royal FloraHolland, the Dutch company behind the world's biggest flower auction.
ransport situation became so difficult that some growers even resorted to destroying parts of their harvest. 
""Only this year, more than three hundred containers with ten tons of flowers each have been exported from Kenya by sea"", Mr Van der Hulst says. ""That's a substantial saving of thirty full cargo aircrafts.""
In addition to being cheaper, using sea freight can cut carbon emissions by between 84% and 95% respectively, according to a study funded by the UK government in 2021.
Although, clearly if you are worried about the carbon footprint of cut flowers, then it's probably best to buy a seasonal bouquet grown closer to home.
More technology of business:
Walking through his green house in Naivasha, Robin Letcher from Royal De Ruiter East Africa, explains to BBC News that rose breeders are also trying to develop new varieties.
Pointing at some red roses he says: ""This variety, for example, has firmer petals that are less sensitive to botrytis [fungus], which is good for sea freight.""
In the future, this could potentially reduce the need for chemicals during post-harvest treatments, although it could take seven to ten years to develop successfully so, ""is something for the longer term"", he adds.
Many flower producers remain nervous about switching over to sea freight.
""A stupid mistake, a port strike or bad weather at sea can really get you in trouble with sea freight,"" Mr Letcher explains.
Last year, for example, a container accidentally went to Singapore. ""It [eventually] arrived in the Netherlands after 53 days. So, all the flowers had to be destroyed, which was a disaster for the producers,"" he says.
Growers also need to contend with the perception in the industry that flowers sent by sea freight have a shorter shelf life, particularly at the world's largest flower auction in the Netherlands.
Customers do not notice much of a difference, according to Ms Kimani who says the sea freight blooms are indistinguishable from air freight flowers, adding that some of their roses even travel better by sea, than by air. 
""Although air freight only takes around 12 hours, we sometimes witness enormous temperature peaks during the journey...which obviously has a negative influence on the flowers,"" she explains. ""With sea freight, however, our flowers are continuously in dormancy.""
gistics of moving these flowers is not a simple decision, as prices are constantly changing. Shipping prices have also been rising closer to air freight costs.
But in the longer term, Mr Moster forecasts sea freight will account for at least 20% of Kenyan flower exports - a sector worth  $934m per year.
""Air freight prices probably will never fall back to the level of before the Covid-19 crisis, so also from a cost perspective sea freight remains interesting,"" Mr Moster says."	/news/business-61877762
politics	Brexit: Progress on trade deals slower than promised	"government is set to miss its target for securing post-Brexit trade agreements, as figures show a 15% fall in the number of UK exporters. 
At the 2019 election the Conservatives promised to get agreements covering 80% of UK trade by the end of this year.
most recent figures suggest it will be just 63%.
A government source said a trade deal with the US had been crucial to meeting the target, but the Biden administration was not prioritising it. 
government also set a target this year to agree a free trade deal with India by Diwali, on 12 November, which was missed. 
Deals have been signed with the EU and 71 countries including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
Japanese deal was criticised earlier this year after government figures showed exports in UK goods and services had fallen to that country in the past year.
Former Environment Secretary George Eustice also criticised the Australia deal, arguing it was ""not actually a very good deal for the UK"".  
A Department for International Trade source said: ""We've set our sights high but recognise to meet this ambition we need a deal with the US, and it is clear the Biden Administration are not prioritising negotiating trade deals with other countries. 
""We're ready to progress talks when the US are, and in the meantime are working hard to secure trade wins for British firms such as removing barriers to American markets worth millions of dollars, resolving disputes like the steel and whisky tariff issues, and pursuing agreements with individual US states.""
Separately, HM Revenue and Customs data shows the number of UK firms classed as exporters fell from 149,443 in 2020 to 126,812 in 2021.

umers, but also to the military. 
Mr Overton said they have always sold to other countries - predominantly the US, but also to Europe. 
r third biggest export destination was Germany, but Mr Overton says the company has ceased all trade with Germany now because of changes since Brexit, resulting in a 2-5% drop in turnover. 
He told the BBC he noticed all his exports to Germany were being ""bounced back"" to the UK. 
He realised this was due to an EU directive on plastics and waste in packaging, which Germany requires exporters to sign up to through a register called LUCID. 
""We didn't know there was a registration process,"" he said.
""I think what the government could really do is pay for expertise to get these messages out."" 
Exporters fell in every nation and region of the UK, but the decline was steepest in the South East of England (23%) and the North West of England (15%), with the lowest decline being in Northern Ireland (4%), the figures show. 
Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that has remained in the EU's single market, which was agreed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland but has led to checks on some goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. 
McKenzie, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said firms were seeing a ""sustained suppression of exports"" since the UK's trade deal with the EU came into force.
Labour's shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the data highlighted a ""worrying future trend"" and showed the government had ""failed to provide the support necessary for exporters"". 
He said Labour would remove barriers to trade with the EU, but ruled out seeking to re-join the single market or customs union - or return to freedom of movement.
Instead, the party would seek a veterinary agreement to reduce barriers for agricultural exports, and ""sort out"" the Northern Ireland protocol that has increased checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, he told the BBC.
Labour would also seek mutual recognition of professional qualifications to allow more service industries to trade with the EU, seek ""equivalent"" data protection rules to enable digital services to compete, and find ""flexible labour mobility arrangements"" for musicians and artists seeking short-term visas to tour in the EU. 
On Wednesday, International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch said the UK ""should be doing better"" on trade, but was recovering from global factors such as Covid and the war in Ukraine.
She told a Commons committee the UK had fully left the EU only at the beginning of 2020, and that ""the full impact of what we're going to see post-Brexit and all of the free trade agreements is yet to be seen"".
Ms Badenoch's department said exports were ""bouncing back"" after the pandemic and had reached £748bn in the last 12 months, an increase of £132bn."	/news/uk-politics-63808657
business	UK faces worst downturn of any advanced economy, OECD says	"UK economy will suffer a bigger blow from the global energy crisis than other leading nations, according to international body the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
UK will contract by more than any other nation in the G7 group next year, it said.
Growth in the US and the eurozone will be weak, but Germany is the only other major economy expected to shrink.
OECD forecasts a ""significant growth slowdown"" globally in 2023.
ks to the strength of emerging economies, the world economy will grow by 2.2% next year, the OECD's latest report predicts.
But the war in Ukraine was affecting economies unevenly, the OECD said, with European countries bearing the brunt of the impact on business, trade and the spike in energy prices. 
G7 includes the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. While growth is expected to be weaker in most countries in the group, only Germany and the UK will contract, the OECD predicts.
OECD expects the UK's economyto shrink by 0.4% in 2023 to be followed by shallow growth of just 0.2% in 2024.
By contrast, last week the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted the UK would shrink by 1.4% next year, although it also predicted stronger growth, of 1.3% in 2024. The OBR said that would lead to the biggest drop in living standards on record.
Earlier this month the Bank of England predicted the downturn could last for two years.
Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to fall by 0.3%, the OECD report says.
Of the wider group of G20 countries, only Russia, which is subject to economic sanctions, is predicted to fare worse than the UK.
OECD, an intergovernmental body that focuses on economic policy, lays some of the blame for the UK's poor performance on the Energy Price Guarantee, the scheme to support household and business energy bills.
While subsidising energy bills reduces the immediate headline inflation rate, the OECD warns that it will add to overall demand in the economy, increasing inflationary pressures in the medium-term. That in turn would require the Bank of England to raise interest rates further and add to the cost of servicing debts.
""Better targeting of measures to cushion the impact of high energy prices would lower the budgetary cost, better-preserve incentives to save energy, and reduce the pressure on demand at a time of high inflation,"" it said.
UK government is moving away from universal support for energy bills after this winter, the prime minister's spokesman pointed out. 
""We're taking a different approach post-April to the energy support, targeting it towards the most vulnerable,"" he said.
In response to the OECD's forecast for the economy, he said this year the UK was forecast to be the fastest growing economy in the G7.
""These are challenges that are affecting different countries at slightly different times,"" he said. 
""We emerged from the pandemic faster than many other countries in Europe. But some of these challenges are shared,"" he said. 
Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: ""We are forecast to be the only OECD economy that will be smaller in 2024 than it was in 2019.
""This is the Tory doom loop. A low growth spiral leading to higher taxes, lower investment, squeezed wages and poor public services.""
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney described the OECD forecast as a ""damning verdict"" and said a succession of Conservative chancellors this year had wrecked hope of growth.
OECD said UK inflation - which hit a 41-year high of 11.1% in October - is likely to peak at the end of this year but remain above 9% in early 2023, slowing to 4.5% by the end of next year.
rganisation expects UK interest rates to rise from their current level of 3% to 4.5% next April and unemployment to rise to 5% by the end of 2024. 
f paying for help with energy bills showed up on the government's accounts in October, as households began receiving the first tranche of a £400 subsidy, and the lower £2,500 energy price cap came into effect.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that these schemes together cost £3.4bn in October.
ushed up government borrowing - the difference between government spending and tax income - to £13.5bn last month, the ONS said.
Although the figure was £4.4bn higher than last year it was lower than analysts had expected.
ONS said that borrowing in the financial year to date - covering April to October 2022 - was £84.4bn, although this was £21.7bn less than in the same period last year."	/news/business-63704841

uo were beaten 21-9, 21-7 by Australia's Wendy Chen Hsuan-yu and Gronya Somerville in the last 16. 
Johnson, 36, was at her sixth Commonwealth Games, having made her debut at Manchester 2002.
""I just feel so lucky,"" Johnson told BBC Channel Islands after the game.
""Had I not been from Guernsey the likelihood of going to six Commonwealth Games just wouldn't have happened.""
Johnson added: ""This is the biggest stage we can represent Guernsey on, so to be here in a team of 28 athletes is a privilege.
""Having done six I've definitely come here wanting to enjoy the experience knowing that it was my last one.""
rs led 8-7 in the first game against a pair that included Chen Hsuan-yu - who has been to the last two Olympics Games - a feat Johnson says is something she will always remember: 
""We watched them at Gold Coast 2018 and were very impressed with them, so to play the way that we played today we were really pleased.
""We came here and we saw our draw and all we could hope for was to play well, and to make them play. 
""I think they went in quite relaxed and halfway through the first they had to really play.""
Meanwhile Guernsey sprinter Abi Galpin's Commonwealth Games came to an end in the 200m semi-finals. 
21-year-old, who qualified after finishing third in her heat on Thursday, finished seventh in her semi-final in a time of 24.10 seconds - 0.28 seconds off her island record. 
Nigeria's Favour Ofili won the race in 22.66 seconds, ahead of Jamaica's Natalliah Whyte.

r will be hoping for less controversy than last year when host Chris Rock was slapped by Will Smith.
Kimmel took the helm in 2017 - the year of  envelopegate - and 2018 before the Oscars went hostless for three years.
Oscars ratings have been falling in recent years although last year saw a slight improvement with the first full ceremony after the pandemic.
In a statement, Kimmel said: ""Being invited to host the Oscars for a third time is either a great honour or a trap. 
""Either way, I am grateful to the Academy for asking me so quickly after everyone good said no.""
Oscars executive producers and showrunners Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner said they were ""super thrilled to have Jimmy score his hat-trick on this global stage"".
""We know he will be funny and ready for anything!"" they stated.
Next year's star-studded event will take place on 12 March. The Academy tweeted: ""Welcome back!"" to the talk show host as it shared the news of Kimmel's return.

Opening the event in 2018, Kimmel said: ""The Academy took action last year to expel Harvey Weinstein from their ranks.
""There were a lot of great nominees, but Harvey deserved it the most.""
Earlier this year, Kimmel found himself in hot water when he was accused of taking the spotlight from Quinta Brunson during the Emmys ceremony in September.
He was awarding the Abbott Elementary creator with the prize for outstanding writing for a comedy series but as part of a joke which began just ahead of the presentation, he stayed lying on the floor pretending to be drunk while Brunson made her speech.

Western Health and Social Care Trust has not said when it expects emergency general surgery to resume.
Its chief executive officer, Neil Guckian, said that ""patients will be safer with these changes"".
But some people in County Fermanagh did not seem convinced about Thursday's announcement. 
""The trust don't understand what it's like to have a rural hospital - travel is not acceptable,"" Dermot Browne told BBC News NI.
""We fought hard to get this hospital here in the first place.""
Mr Browne added that ""the direction of travel has been concerning for people here"".
""If there is an issue with staff that needs to be resolved with services reinstated as soon as possible.""
Despite saying the move was temporary, the trust did not say when it expected emergency general surgery would resume.
mergency department and other services including obstetrics will continue to operate as normal.
Other - mostly lower grade - surgeons will remain on site at the County Fermanagh hospital.
rust said this was necessary to protect the public's safety after it had problems recruiting surgical staff.
Protesters gathered outside the town hall in objection to the announcement.
Representatives from the trust held a meeting with local community and council representatives in Enniskillen Town Hall on Thursday evening.
At it, Mr Guckian said that regardless of what had been reported in the media, he was ""proud of the engagement between the trust and the council"".
He said the trust was dealing with a very difficult situation in regard to emergency surgery and was ""working our way through this"".
He paid tribute to all surgeons at SWAH for maintaining services over the years in challenging circumstances. 
However, Reggie Ferguson, chairman from Save Our Acute Services (SOAS), told the meeting it was his organisation's belief that the trust had been deliberately running down services in preparation for the announcement.
""This has been on the cards for a long time,"" he said.
""Your communication is terrible, everything seems to be behind the scenes.""
Referring to the region's poor infrastructure in the context of proposals to transport some patients to other hospitals, Mr Ferguson added: ""The road to Altnagelvin would make you sick if you weren't sick already."" 
UUP councillor Diane Armstrong said it was ""a dark day that affects everybody, man, woman and child"".
Ms Armstrong said the people of Fermanagh and south Tyrone ""feel marginalised by this decision"", and she was personally ""absolutely disgusted"".
No one likes change -  especially if it affects your local health service.  
But according to Raphael Bengoa - and several other health experts who've penned health reviews - change is necessary if Northern Ireland's health system is to be sustainable. 
People in Enniskillen say they are the latest ""casualties"" in plans to change how services are delivered across the region. 
Western Trust argues that change is necessary as the service is no longer safe. 
Whatever the argument, local people say it feels like this is being thrust on them as a last resort.  
me what should have taken place was much needed dialogue, explanation and local people being properly informed about how the proposed changes will affect them.
Instead, they say, a vacuum was created which encouraged rumour and misinformation that SWAH was set to remove all its emergency services. 
While making any sort of change to the Northern Ireland health and social care system can be politicised and emotive - not having those conversations in advance can often be even more problematic. 
Diane McCaffery, who attended with her husband Eunan, is a retired emergency care manager from the cardio assessment unit at SWAH.
She said she had seen first hand how emergency surgery saved lives and thought this decision to reduce surgical services was ""catastrophic"".
Carmel Tracey and her daughter Emily said they ""know the implications"" of the announcement.
""Having to be transferred could put your life at risk. We deserve better,"" said added Ms Tracey.
Sinn Féin MP Michelle Gildernew challenged the trust to set out clearly their plan for the restoration of emergency surgical services.
""The people of Fermanagh (and South Tyrone) need clarity from the trust on the steps they have taken to date, but most importantly, the actions they will now take, to ensure emergency surgical services at SWAH are urgently restored. 
""Vague assurances will not do.""
Earlier in the day, DUP MLA Deborah Erskine said she understood the concerns of constituents but felt there was good news for the hospital's future with the announcement that it is to become a new centre for planned surgery.
""The pressures with surgeons date back to 2018 in the Western Trust,"" she said.
""We need to have a system, we need to have a way forward in which we ensure services are safe for both the workplace in the SWAH and also for our patients."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63644073
entertainment	George Alagiah takes TV break after cancer spreads	"BBC presenter George Alagiah will be taking a break from TV after discovering his cancer has spread further, his agent has said. 
He was first diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2014 and has stepped back from presenting intermittently for treatment since then.
journalist, 66, returned to the BBC's News at Six in April. 
Working in the newsroom ""has been such an important part of keeping energised and motivated"", said Alagiah.
In a statement, he said ""it's back to the tough stuff"" after a scan showed his cancer had spread further. 
""I'm missing my colleagues"", he said, adding that he was looking forward to returning to the studio ""as soon as I can"". 
ws was confirmed by his agent Mary Greenham.
In January, Alagiah said he thought the cancer he had had since 2014 would ""probably get me in the end"", but he still feels ""very lucky"". 
Speaking on the podcast Desperately Seeking Wisdom he said that when his cancer was first diagnosed, it took a while for him to understand what he ""needed to do"".
""I had to stop and say, 'Hang on a minute. If the full stop came now, would my life have been a failure?'
""And actually, when I look back and I looked at my journey... the family I had, the opportunities my family had, the great good fortune to bump into (Frances Robathan), who's now been my wife and lover for all these years, the kids that we brought up... it didn't feel like a failure.""
Alagiah underwent 17 rounds of chemotherapy to treat his advanced bowel cancer in 2014 and said he was a ""richer person"" for it upon returning to presenting the following year.
As well as presenting the news, Alagiah has worked as a BBC News foreign correspondent and specialist on Africa and the developing world, covering events including the Rwandan genocide and interviewing Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer, but the NHS advice is to see your GP if you have one or more of the symptoms and they have persisted for more than four weeks.
And if you, or someone you know, have been affected by cancer, information and support is available on the BBC's Action Line page.

technology	Germany fires cybersecurity chief 'over Russia ties'	"Germany's cybersecurity chief has been fired after allegations of being excessively close to Russia through an association he helped set up.
Arne Schönbohm had led the Federal Cyber Security Authority (BSI) - charged with protecting government communications - since 2016. 
German media have accused him of having had links with people involved with Russian intelligence services. 
rior ministry is investigating allegations made against him.
But it confirmed he had been fired with immediate effect.
Mr Schönbohm had come under scrutiny after his potential links to a Russian company through a previous role were highlighted by Jan Böhmermann, the host of one of Germany's most popular late-night TV shows. 
Before leading the BSI, Mr Schönbohm had helped set up and run the Cyber Security Council Germany, a private association which advises business and policymakers on cybersecurity issues. 
He is said to have maintained close ties to the association and attended their 10th anniversary celebrations in September. 
One of the association's members was a cybersecurity company called Protelion, which was a subsidiary of a Russian firm reportedly established by a former member of the KGB honoured by President Vladimir Putin.
Protelion was ejected from the association last weekend, and Cyber Security Council Germany says the allegations of links to Russian intelligence are untrue. 
A spokesperson for Interior Minister Nancy Faeser appeared to confirm that Mr Schönbohm's sacking had come in response to the recent reports, saying: ""The background to this is not least the allegations revealed and widely discussed in the media.""
kesperson added: ""Necessary public trust in the neutrality and impartiality of his leadership as president of the most important German cybersecurity agency has been damaged.""
But they emphasised that the security chief would be ""presumed innocent"" while an investigation into the allegations was conducted. 
German media outlet Der Spiegel earlier reported that Mr Schönbohm had requested formal disciplinary proceedings to be opened against him, after receiving no ""feedback"" from the government after the initial accusations. 
He said he did not yet know ""what the ministry has examined and what the concrete allegations against me look like"".
Berlin is said to be increasingly concerned that its critical infrastructure could be targeted by Russian intelligence as it steps up its support for Ukraine. 
Last week, the defence ministry announced it planned to deliver four anti-air defence systems to Kyiv. A single IRIS-T unit is said to be capable of defending an entire city from air assaults. "	/news/world-europe-63301864

politics	Government to share energy-saving tips in TV ads	"UK government will promote energy-saving tips in adverts on TV and at bus stops as part of an information campaign due to be launched this week.
mpaign will feature ads with the strapline ""It All Adds Up"" and a new website with advice such as turning down boilers.
Business Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to be involved in messaging to help households reduce energy use.
government estimates the campaign will cost taxpayers about £18m.
w website is expected to go live on Saturday before adverts on TV, radio and on the sides of buses appear after Christmas.
A government source said they were keen to get Mr Shapps out doing interviews and possibly recording videos for promotion on social media.
urce said the campaign will be pushed out on government social media channels and ""we'll try to get energy-saving networks such as Which? and energy companies to help get it to as wide an audience as possible"".
One of the main focuses will be encouraging households to lower their boiler-flow temperature to 60C in order to save an estimated £100 a year.
Other advice will include turning off appliances at the plug when they are not in use, and draught-proofing windows and doors by putting blankets under them.
mpaign, designed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), is part of the government's push to curb energy use during the cost-of-living crisis.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's approach has differed to that of his predecessor, Liz Truss, who was reported to have been ""ideologically opposed"" to an energy-saving a campaign.
But her government changed tack and said it was considering how to expand the existing Help for Households website.
One government source said the campaign being launched this weekend was an extension of that website.
Help for Households website includes actions such as turning down radiators not in use to save an estimated £70 per year.
government has capped the amount per unit of energy suppliers can charge consumers so that a typical bill remains at £2,500 a year until the end of March.
But help with energy costs will be less generous from April, with bills for a typical household going up to £3,000.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has described cutting energy use as a ""national mission"" to stop the UK being ""blackmailed"" by the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
war in Ukraine has tightened supplies of gas, which the UK is heavily reliant on for heating and powering its homes and businesses.
Mr Hunt said ""in the end everyone is going to have to take responsibility for their energy bills"" and consider how to cut their consumption."	/news/uk-politics-63971909
business	Credit Suisse shares hit by worries over financial health	"Shares in Credit Suisse plunged on Monday as fears mount over the financial health of the Swiss bank.
Its shares fell by more than 10%, after the bank's boss failed to reassure investors - but later bounced back.
Last week, chief executive Ulrich Koerner insisted in a memo to staff that Credit Suisse's financial position was solid.
It comes ahead of a restructuring plan due when the bank reports results at the end of October.
Sources close to the bank confirmed a report in the Financial Times that executives at the Swiss bank spent much of the weekend seeking to calm key stakeholders about its financial strength.
A Credit Suisse spokesperson refused to comment.
In last week's memo, Mr Koerner told staff: ""I trust that you are not confusing our day-to-day stock price performance with the strong capital base and liquidity position of the bank.""
He said there were ""many factually inaccurate statements being made"" in the media, but urged staff to stay committed ahead of the transformation plan, which will be unveiled on 27 October.
""We are in the process of reshaping Credit Suisse for a long-term, sustainable future - with significant potential for value creation.
""I am confident we have what it takes to succeed.""
Shares in Credit Suisse have been sliding over the past year amid fear's over the bank's financial position.
In July, the bank announced a strategy review and replaced its chief executive, Thomas Gottstein, with Mr Koerner, an asset management expert.
Credit Suisse has a major hub in London and employs 5,500 people in the UK.
According to Reuters, the Bank of England is monitoring the situation together with the Swiss regulator, FINMA.
Bank of England declined to comment.
f executive of Credit Suisse insists the bank is as solid and stable as the Matterhorn. The problem is, from the outside it isn't looking that way - and perceptions matter.
k has been battered by scandal. It lost billions due to the collapse of Archegos Capital Management, suffered further damage from lending to the failed finance company Greensill Capital, and was fined hundreds of millions for its involvement in a loan scandal in Mozambique.
Ulrich Koerner was brought earlier this year to implement a major overhaul of the investment banking unit. He's due to unveil his plans later this month.
But market moves suggest some investors believe the bank is running out of cash.
Mr Koerner claims all is well - and he has written to Credit Suisse staff to reassure them of the fact. The trouble is, that memo itself appears to have triggered further speculation about the health of the business."	/news/business-63117352

technology	'There really is more to life than posting on Instagram'	"When Gayle Macdonald reached a summit in Spain's Sierra Nevada mountain range earlier this year, she didn't just stop and take in the moment.
Instead, the 45-year-old did what a great many people would do - she looked for the best spot to take a selfie for her social media accounts. Gayle even admits that she moved dangerously close to the edge while doing so.
It was after that moment, for which she was berated by her husband, that she decided to quit social media.
""I was like, 'this has got to stop,'"" recalls Gayle, a British expat who lives near the Spanish city of Granada. ""Taking a photo was previously the first thing I thought about when I got out of the car.
""Thinking all the time about creating content, and worrying about what to say, was taking up too much headspace and getting me down.""
A week later she posted on Facebook and Instagram that she would be leaving the platforms. ""It was amazing how it was my most-liked post on Instagram. Everyone was commenting 'I wish I could do that' and 'you're so brave'.""
Gayle, who is a life coach specialising in helping people give up drinking, worked out that she spent about 11 hours a week, on average, on social media. 
She says the thought of ditching the apps was much scarier than actually leaving. 
""Once the initial withdrawal was over, I didn't have cravings,"" she says. ""It was quite liberating. I am now more than six months into my social media sobriety, and I have regained some of that sense of freedom and peace that I experienced when I quit alcohol.""
For many of us, a hefty chunk of our time is spent on social media. One global study in July estimated that the average person spends two hours and 29 minutes per day on such apps and websites. That's five minutes more than a year earlier.
While some people might think that this is a bad habit that they should cut down on, for others it's an actual addiction that they need help to overcome.
UK Addiction Treatment (UKAT), an organisation that runs centres to treat social media addiction, says it has seen a 5% increase in the number of people seeking its help for the problem over the past three years.
""Society has undoubtedly developed a strong dependency to social media, and the internet in general since the pandemic,"" says Nuno Albuquerque, a counsellor at UKAT.
Increased awareness of these concerns has led to more people like Gayle quitting social media, or at least spending less time on it. And the providers are noticing.
Earlier this year, Facebook's owner Meta reported that its number of daily active users had declined for the first time in its history. Meanwhile, a leaked internal Twitter report last month said that its previously most active users were now tweeting less. Twitter did not deny the accuracy of the leak.
Even Twitter's new owner, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, speculated earlier this year: ""Is Twitter dying?"" And in recent days his takeover has resulted in some Hollywood celebrities saying they will quit Twitter, unhappy with Musk's views on free speech and plans for the service.
But back in the real world, what are the other reasons why people are leaving social media?
Entrepreneur Urvashi Agarwal previously quit Instagram in 2014, but that only lasted for about a year. In August this year she deleted her personal account for a second time, and she's adamant that this time there will be no going back.
""I'm definitely done,"" says the founder of UK teabag brand JP's Originals, who lives in London. 
""One hundred per cent. Not only is it just wasting so much time, but it feels like there's just less and less privacy in the world. Everything you do is constantly out there."" 
Urvashi also no longer uses Twitter or Facebook, and she finds it liberating. ""I love it. I now read 15 pages of a book every night instead.""
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Hilda Burke, psychotherapist and author of The Phone Addiction Workbook, says there's now more widespread awareness about how much time people are ""frittering"" away on social media platforms. 
""This is now easily quantifiable, as most phones show you the breakdown of how you're spending your time online,"" she says. 
""Seeing how it all adds up can serve as a powerful wake-up call. Many of my clients have expressed a correlation between heavy social media use and poor sleep and increased anxiety.""
She advises that people quitting social media should let all their friends know, so they don't continue to try to contact you via the sites. ""Offer other ways of getting in touch... perhaps an old-fashioned phone call could serve the relationship better in the absence of direct messages.""
Kashmir, who declined to give her surname, is a 27-year-old public relations (PR) executive from Rochester in Kent. She quit Instagram 10 months ago, having previously also walked away from Snapchat.
""The main driver was my mental health,"" she says. ""There's a lot of pressure to live up to what other people are doing, which isn't really representative, or the reality of that person.
""I would find myself scrolling at night, and then having a bad night's sleep, and then waking up not feeling refreshed. Now I'm not making comparisons in my day-to-day life, and I don't really know what celebrities are doing.
""It allows me to be more present and firm, and committed to the decisions I make rather than being influenced.""
Kashmir adds that not being on Instagram and Snapchat does not affect her PR work, and that she still uses LinkedIn if she is ever looking for a new job.
UKAT's Nuno Albuquerque says social media can be addictive for many reasons, the main one being that it is a form of escapism, especially for the younger generation. 
""It's simply a way of connecting without connection, and it's a 24/7 comfort blanket of company for many. But addiction feeds off isolation, and if someone spends more time living online than in the moment, then they will naturally become isolated, and addiction can creep in.""
He welcomes the fact that more people are quitting social media. ""It's likely that we're eventually starting to realise the damage it can cause to our relationships, mental health and our experience of real-world moments.""
Back in Spain, Gayle Macdonald says she's happier without social media. ""It's so liberating to sit and have a cup of tea without worrying about the image, the caption and whether or not it should be a story, or a reel, or a post. There really is more to life."""	/news/business-63482162
