sports	Meggan Dawson-Farrell: 'I said I would run away from sports camp'	"Meggan Dawson-Farrell's comic timing may be the key to Britain securing wheelchair curling success in Beijing - as she knows how to quell a tense situation.
""It helps, if games aren't going so well, to give the team a lift,"" she says. ""But I've been told I'm not allowed to tell any more jokes, because they are really bad!""
Dawson-Farrell didn't play sport at school, but attending a sports camp as a teenager transformed her life.
""I told my mum I would run away, but three days later when she came to pick me up, I didn't want to leave,"" she says.
29-year old - a Paralympic debutant in Beijing - will be hoping Britain can repeat previous medal successes in the event - a bronze in 2014, and a silver when the sport made its debut in 2006."	/sport/av/disability-sport/60601952
entertainment	K-pop fans in Birmingham find sense of community	"Fans of K-pop say they are finding a sense of community in Birmingham, as places dedicated to the musical genre continue to spring up.
first studio dedicated to the music opened in the city in April and new shops cater to the area's fanbase.
ularity of K-pop has continued to spread with bands topping the UK album chart in the past three years.
""Seeing it grow and be able to have a place to go and buy my albums is really special,"" one fan, Hannah, said.
KPOPPINUK, which claims to be the first dedicated K-pop shop in Birmingham, held a photo-trading-card event on 4 December to allow fans to meet friends and buy merchandise.   
Owner Jane Langley said: ""We have a really big community, it's about having somewhere to buy albums physically and also being able to interact personally with other fans."" 
Fan Lexy said she used to be made fun of at school for liking the chart-topping music, but she said it was considered more normal now and ""the atmosphere at K-pop concerts is really friendly"".
w spaces were allowing people to find a sense of community, the fans said.
Korean-exchange student Hayoon said she felt welcomed by the growing British interest in Korean pop culture.
It gave her confidence and had been, she said, ""a great way to make new friends"".
K-pop dance studio XI only opened in Birmingham in April, although fans have already found ways to learn routines together and perform in public places. 
IVIX is just one of several K-pop dance groups in Birmingham and leader Emily Hancocks described the group as a second family.
She said: ""We meet up pretty much every weekend, it just makes me feel really happy.""
genre's popularity has been notable, as band Blackpink became the first K-pop girl group to top the UK album charts, three years after boyband BTS did the same.
ustry annually generates about $10bn for South Korea, according to non-profit group International Socioeconomics Laboratory. 
Although none of the biggest K-pop acts have yet played a concert in Birmingham, fans in the West Midlands are hoping that will change in the near future.

health	COPD lung disease sufferers waiting years for diagnosis	"People living with severe lung disease in Northern Ireland need faster and more accurate care, a leading charity has said. 
One in four patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the UK wait at least five years for a diagnosis, according to a report from Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland.
Up to 42,000 people in NI suffer from COPD, the charity says.
It has called for lung health to become a priority.
""We are hearing shocking stories of people spending years... struggling to breathe, unaware that they have a lung condition which could be managed with the right treatment and support,"" said Joseph Carter, head of Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland.
""Diagnosis of COPD needs to be faster and more accurate and there needs to be greater awareness of the seriousness of lung conditions and the signs and symptoms to look out for.""
rity is campaigning for a new lung health strategy to improve diagnostic rates, increase pulmonary rehabilitation services, and reduce the number of respiratory deaths in Northern Ireland.
COPD is an umbrella term for a group of incurable lung conditions which cause breathing difficulties. 
udes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It affects more than one million people in the UK. 
Every patient with COPD should get a yearly flu and a regular pneumonia vaccine, according to the charity. 
uld also have a personalised plan to help them manage their condition, be offered optimised treatment for any other medical conditions and support to stop smoking if they need it. 
Delays in diagnosis of COPD can result in loss of lung function.
report, Delayed Diagnosis and Unequal Care: The reality for people with COPD in the UK in 2022, was published on Tuesday ahead of World COPD Day on Wednesday.
Results are based on a survey of 6,500 people across the UK. The sample size for Northern Ireland was small but the charity said it mirrored the rest of the UK results. 
Sharon Stewart from Dungiven has first-hand experience of the condition after her father was diagnosed in 2018.
""My dad, Jimmy worked as a mechanic and car sprayer for many years,"" she said.
""He was always very outgoing. He played the drums and was a great entertainer. He loved getting out and about.""
When he became ill, there was no clear diagnosis but he had to give up work. 
Sharon said her father was on inhalers for two years before he was finally hospitalised and diagnosed with COPD in 2018. 
""As a family, we felt Jimmy was not getting the proper level of care,"" she said.
""When his breathing worsened, he was no longer able to go out or walk, he was always exhausted and tired.  
""His home life was also affected as it took almost one year for a stairlift to be installed. This meant he stayed most of the time upstairs in his bedroom so that he could access the bathroom.""
k a dire toll on him, she said.
""He was not the same person, he couldn't walk any distance because his breathing was so bad.""
Jimmy died in September 2021 at the age of 74.
family and community helped raise more than £5,700 for Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland. 
""We are aware of all the constraints on our health service, but these gaps in care are making things worse,"" said Sharon.
More than a third of people surveyed in the report said they were unable to recognise the signs of COPD and around 23% said they were misdiagnosed as their doctor thought they had a chest infection or cough. 
Respiratory conditions make up one of the top three killers in Northern Ireland.
Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland said people with lung conditions in the poorest neighbourhoods are three and half times more likely to die than those in the richest areas in Northern Ireland."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63625674
politics	'If I buy a bus ticket I can't eat for two days' - asylum seeker Aymen	"Aymen Alkhawlani wakes each morning and asks himself the same question: Do I buy a bus ticket and go hungry, or eat and be alone?
Such dilemmas are familiar to people in the UK asylum system.
With most barred from working, they rely on UK government support. Typically this is £40.85 a week, or £5.84 a day. Others in hotels are given £8.24 a week, or £1.18 a day.
Aymen is one of several people in the asylum system who have spoken to BBC Scotland about the crisis they face as the cost of living soars at the fastest rate in 40 years. The self-titled ""new Scots"" want to be allowed to work while awaiting decisions on their applications.
Home Office says its payments are to cover essential needs for people ""who would otherwise be destitute"". 
But recipients say they are often unable to afford transport, good quality clothing, food, internet access and medicine.
Aymen is from Yemen and arrived in the UK in April 2021. He was placed in a hotel in Falkirk for a year before getting Home Office accommodation in Airdrie in October. 
He said he feels alone and cannot afford to buy return train or bus tickets for the 30-minute trip to Glasgow where he meets up with other people in the asylum system.
He explained: ""The only way to meet people is to go to Glasgow. And I need to spend a lot, at least £10, to go to Glasgow and back.
""If I decide to go to Glasgow, I won't be able to eat for two days.""
re are approximately 5,200 people in the asylum support system in Scotland with about 4,700 accommodated and/or financially supported by the Home Office. They can apply for £40.85 per week from the UK government. 
Some can request permission to work if they have been waiting for more than a year for a response on their claim, but most of those granted permission are only allowed to work in jobs on the official shortage occupation list, which was recently expanded to include nursing and care roles.
Aymen says he is only given about £35 a week because he received an extra £40 payment when he was offered housing in England, which he rejected.
He said he will not receive the full weekly allowance until he pays back the £40, which he says he has no way of doing.
31-year-old, who worked as an English teacher in Yemen, said: ""I can't even eat three meals a day nowadays because I only receive £35 a week. I have to skip dinner most of the time. Breakfast and lunch is pretty much all I have.""
He added: ""Because I don't have the money to buy bus tickets, I stay home all the time. So that also adds to my depression.""
For those in hotel accommodation, which is provided by private contractors, the level of government support is lower.
In Scotland, between 500 and 600 people in the asylum system live in 10 hotels across eight local authorities.
Since they are provided with ""full board"", they can only apply for £8.24 in support per week, or £1.18 a day. The Home Office says this should cover clothing, non-prescription medicine and travel.
But Hawre, a Kurdish man in his 30s who asked to remain anonymous, said: ""The £8 does literally nothing, especially in this cost of living crisis.""
""We can't even go to a barbershop to get a haircut. 
""We are at the point where we give each other haircuts, regardless of the quality of what we can do.""
He has spent a year in a hotel in Aberdeen, awaiting news on his asylum application.
Having worked as a painter and decorator in Iraq, Hawre says he is frustrated about his inability to earn his own money.
He explained: ""Financial gain wasn't something on my mind when I came here. If I didn't have a big issue in Iraq, if it wasn't life-threatening, I wouldn't come here to live under these circumstances living on £1 a day. 
""It makes me feel less human, like we're being treated inhumanely.""
Herberth, a poet from El Salvador, arrived in Scotland in April having also fled his home country due to fears for his safety. 
He applied for financial support in October but has been told he is unlikely to hear back until January.
Herberth lives in Glasgow with his partner, a UK citizen, so does not rely on Home Office housing support. But he says not being able to earn money is damaging his mental health, as well as his finances.
uthor of two poetry books in his homeland, the 35-year-old is studying for a psychology degree which he started in El Salvador but can complete online.
He would like to study for a masters degree in clinical psychology in Scotland, but he is struggling to get access to higher education due to his immigration status.
Herberth has managed to enrol on an advanced English course at City of Glasgow College. ""That's a big help,"" he said. ""But of course, I would like to get a job, study here in Scotland, those type of things I'm missing out on and it's affecting my life. I'm 35 years old and I'm in my most productive years and I'm unable to work, so it's a very stressful situation.""
Maryhill Integration Network (MIN), an organisation which supports people in the asylum system in the Glasgow area, provides a haven to both Herberth and Aymen.
Pinar Aksu, human rights and advocacy coordinator at MIN, said: ""With the cost of living crisis, people seeking asylum are forced to live in extreme poverty having to choose between buying food, clothes, or travelling.""
She backed the Lift the Ban coalition, a campaign urging the UK government to give people the right to work after six months in the UK. 
MIN has also called on Holyrood to follow the Welsh government by providing free bus passes for people seeking asylum. Aksu said the move would allow people to travel without being ""forced to pick between food, travel and essential needs"".
Scottish government said it continued to consider plans to provide free bus travel to refugees and people in the asylum system.
Campaign group Refugees for Justice told BBC Scotland that people in the asylum system are especially vulnerable during the cost of living crisis, and called for the UK government to increase weekly payments.
A Home Office spokesperson said the Nationality and Borders Act, which became law in June, ""will fix the broken asylum system"" by speeding up the application process and ""focusing on those genuinely fleeing persecution"". 
ued: ""For asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, we provide accommodation and a weekly allowance for food, clothing, transport and sundries. 
""The Home Office ensures all spending is carefully scrutinised to make sure that every pound of taxpayers' money is spent in the most effective way. We review the allowance rates on an annual basis and we have commenced this year's annual review."""	/news/uk-scotland-63794296

technology	Elon Musk: Billionaire's daughter cuts ties with her father	"Elon Musk's transgender daughter has applied to legally change her name and gender, saying she no longer wants to ""be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form"".
18-year-old has asked to be recognised as female and have the name Vivian Jenna Wilson.
She was known as Xavier Alexander Musk.
for both a name change and a new birth certificate was filed with the Los Angeles County Superior Court in Santa Monica.
Her request is set out in court documents filed in April, which have only recently come to light.
re was no further detail of the apparent rift between Mr Musk's daughter and her father.
SpaceX entrepreneur has yet to comment.
Mr Musk was married to Vivian's mother, Canadian author Justine Wilson, from 2000 until they divorced in 2008. 
r first son, Nevada, was born in 2002, and died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) at 10 weeks.
r went on to have twin sons called Xavier and Griffin and triplet boys - Damian, Kai and Saxon. 
He has two other children,  X Æ A-Xii and Exa Dark Sideræl - who goes by Y - with singer Grimes, with whom he has had an on-off relationship. 
His children have kept a relatively low profile despite their father's fame.
On Father's Day, the entrepreneur tweeted that he loves all his children.
re has been no comment from Mr Musk about his daughter's decision to distance herself from him.
He has been vocal on various transgender issues, and has been branded anti-gay in several rows. Last year he complained about people using their own pronouns.
urt document for his daughter's name and gender change was filed a month before he publicly declared his support for the Republican Party, having previously voted Democrat.
He has also said he is a fan of Ron DeSantis, the Republican Florida governor who introduced the so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. This controversial piece of legislation restricts schools from teaching students about sexual orientation and gender issues, with teachers opening themselves up to lawsuits should they fail to comply.
In 2020 Elon Musk wrote on Twitter ""Pronouns suck"" before deleting it. He then said: ""I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an aesthetic nightmare."""	/news/technology-61880709
technology	BGMI: Why India has blocked the popular combat mobile game	"A popular combat and survival game similar to hit video game PlayerUnknown's Battleground (PUBG) has been blocked in India.
Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) has been taken off the Google and Apple app stores. 
Google said it had blocked access to the game in the country after receiving a government order.
Developer Krafton confirmed the news and said it was talking to authorities to understand why it was suspended.
BGMI is a rebranded avatar of PUBG, which was among a slew of Chinese-origin apps blocked by the Indian government in 2020.
2020 took place against the backdrop of tensions between the two countries along a disputed Himalayan border.
In several phases throughout the year, India banned apps like WeChat Work and TikTok, that had Chinese links.
""The government had banned these apps citing security concerns, data of Indian citizens going out etc, but it was essentially meant to put pressure on China over the border conflict,"" says tech analyst Prasanto K Roy.
PUBG was developed by a subsidiary of the South Korean company, Krafton, and operated in India through Tencent Games, a division of the Chinese multinational Tencent Holdings.
mpany cut ties with Tencent in India and released BGMI in 2021. A year after its launch, the Krafton said the game had 100 million registered users in India. 
In June, PUBG made headlines again after a 16-year-old boy in Lucknow city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh allegedly shot his mother dead for scolding him about playing the game.
renewed a debate about the violence in such games and also came up in the ongoing session of the parliament.
In response to an MP's question about such apps, the government said it was looking into reports of rebranded and similar sounding apps.
urrent BGMI ban links itself back to the Chinese apps ban, says Mr Roy.
""Since 2020, the government had added a further layer of scrutiny to funding sources which come from a country with which India shares a land border,"" he says. ""It has also been looking harder and harder at apps with Chinese origin.""
r, the government and the Reserve Bank of India have been cracking down on lending-related apps. ""These apps are not regulated and triggered genuine issues but the scrutiny has essentially to do with the concerns with China,"" he says.
While BGMI is published by the South Korea's Krafton, China's Tencent Holdings has a 13.6% stake in the company through its subsidiary Image Frame Investment.
Under intense government scrutiny, Mr Roy says, apps that are Chinese-owned or have significant Chinese investment will continue to find it extremely difficult to operate in India."	/news/world-asia-india-62344926
health	West Suffolk Hospital's plans for replacement are approved	"Plans for a new, larger hospital to replace one deemed ""past its use-by date"" have been given the go-ahead.
West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (WSFT) wants to build a new hospital to replace the current one in Bury St Edmunds which was built in the 1970s.
West Suffolk Council's development control committee was split over the proposal which it heard would result in the loss of ""irreplaceable habitat"".
But, councillors decided, the need for a new hospital outweighed concerns.
West Suffolk Council's approval allows WSFT to submit a business plan as part as an application for funding from central government, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
mmittee heard the current building had structural defects associated with reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) used in its roof and walls.
It was expected the current building would not last far beyond 2030 and government funding was gained to replace it under the New Hospitals Programme - with a commitment to have it built by 2030.
Under the plans, the new hospital would be located on the Hardwick Manor site, owned by WSFT, on Hardwick Lane.
Most of the Hardwick Manor site is wood pasture parkland and, according to the officers' report, the development was expected to result in the loss of 11.5 hectares of waxcap grassland, which is classified as irreplaceable habitat.
Independent councillor Jason Crooks said: ""This is a real shame. The applicant has chosen to destroy parkland that's hundreds of years old and it is completely irreplaceable when we all know there are better alternatives.
""It is so frustrating. I don't think I can vote for this because of the destruction of the parkland,"" he said.
Concerns were also raised about emergency access to the site.
But Conservative councillor Andrew Drummond, who had the deciding vote as chairman, said: ""The care you get at West Suffolk Hospital is fantastic. But the building is past its use-by date and that will inevitably affect services.""
A full planning application to change the use of Hardwick Manor from residential to health-related was also approved.

politics	Rishi Sunak: World leaders welcome next UK prime minister	"World leaders have been reacting to Rishi Sunak's victory in the race to be the next British prime minister. 
Many offered their congratulations, and expressed hope for stability after a ""turbulent"" few weeks. 
What the leadership is saying: ""As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues, and implementing Roadmap 2030,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, referring to a framework agreement struck between the two countries. ""Special Diwali wishes to the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership.""
What the press is saying: Mr Sunak's appointment has been big news in India, with Indian news channels breaking into rolling coverage. ""Indian son rises over the Empire, history comes full circle in Britain,"" was how one channel put it.
kground: It is no surprise that there is a lot of interest in Mr Sunak's rise in India. His grandparents come from Punjab, while his father-in-law is Narayana Murthy, the founder of Infosys and one of India's best-known businessmen. Sunak is also a Hindu who took his oath as MP on the Hindu holy book the Bhagavad Gita. India and the UK have been trying to strike a free trade deal, but talks reportedly stalled over fears among Sunak's party it could lead to more immigration. 
What the leadership is saying: Kenya's president, William Ruto, has yet to comment publicly on Mr Sunak's new position. 
What the press is saying: The Taifa Leo newspaper called Mr Sunak's rise another ""Barack Obama moment"". ""Sunak's case is nearly similar to that of former US President Barack Obama, who is an American citizen but has Kenyan roots as his father was born in Homa Bay County,"" Citizen Digital website said. Popular newspaper commentator Macharia Gaitho said ""Kenya has conquered the British Empire"". 
kground: Mr Sunak's father, Yashvir, was born in colonial Kenya to parents who had moved from Gujranwala, now in Pakistan, in the 1930s. Mr Sunak's father moved to the UK in the 1960s, where he became a GP. 
What the leadership is saying: European Council President Charles Michel said: ""Working together is the only way to face common challenges... and bringing stability is key to overcoming them.""
kground: Rishi Sunak is a Brexit supporter, but many EU leaders will have breathed a sigh of relief that he, not Boris Johnson, is taking over as prime minister, our Europe editor Katya Adler says. He is considered a pragmatist, and EU officials will want to work with him on rising energy costs, and the difficult issue of the Northern Ireland protocol, an important trading arrangement struck during Brexit talks.
During the August leadership contest, Mr Sunak said a trade war with the EU was not in the UK's interest. But finding compromise may be politically difficult for him, and Brussels fears he might shun working with the EU to protect his political support at home. 
What the leadership is saying: Irish PM Micheál Martin said he looked forward to working with Mr Sunak, ""on the important issues we face on these islands and globally"".  
What the press is saying: The Irish Times welcomed Mr Sunak's reputation for ""sensible politics"", but said he will face challenges, particularly with Brexit. It is not yet clear what his election means for the Northern Ireland protocol, the paper said. The Irish Independent said the new prime minister had been ""vindicated"" after the ""folly"" of Ms Truss's tax cuts. 
kground: Brexit remains one of the key issues between the UK and Ireland, with the Northern Ireland protocol now at the forefront of the agenda. Currently, goods being imported from Britain are checked before entering Northern Ireland. But the UK government previously called for a two-tier system, with checks only being conducted on goods destined for onward travel to the republic. 
Watch: Biden calls Sunak's rise to UK prime minister a ""ground-breaking milestone""
What the leadership is saying: At a White House event to mark the Hindu holiday of Diwali, President Biden described Mr Sunak's nomination as the UK's next prime minister a ""ground-breaking milestone"". The US president is holding back on formally congratulating Mr Sunak until he has met King Charles and been asked to form a government, as protocol dictates. 
What the press is saying: The New York Times lauds the ""record of representation"" built by the Conservatives in recent years, saying Mr Sunak's victory is another milestone in a history of promoting women and people of colour to prominent positions. The Washington Post also emphasised Mr Sunak's position as the first person of colour to be prime minister. The paper added that it would be ""the first time in history that the residents of Downing Street are richer than those of Buckingham Palace"". 
kground: Joe Biden has already said he would maintain a ""close relationship"" with whoever succeeded Ms Truss. He called her abandoned plans to cut taxes a ""mistake"", causing some eyebrows to be raised - US presidents tend to avoid commenting on allies' domestic policies. 
What the leadership is saying: China wants to ""advance ties with the UK"" under Sunak, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. He added: ""We hope that we can work with the UK side on the basis of mutual respect and win-win co-operation and advance China-UK relations along the right track.""
What the press is saying: State-run CGTN highlighted reports that Mr Sunak will be the first prime minister to be richer than the monarch. ""His experience managing the UK's finances, and in particular his strongly-voiced opposition to Truss' disastrous plans for borrowing-funded tax cuts, prompted many in the party to view him as the safest choice,"" it said. Shanghai-based The Paper wrote that Sunak's victory ""would appear to signal a new achievement in his efforts to overcome racism in British politics"" but that it ""could not overshadow his other controversies"", mentioning the BBC video clip of him saying he had no working class friends in 2007, and his wife's previous non-domiciled status which excused her from paying some tax. 
kground: Rishi Sunak has favoured closer ties with China than his predecessor, and was criticised by Ms Truss for pursuing a trading relationship when chancellor. Ms Truss spoke of a need to avoid ""dependency"" on China, and during the summer leadership race said she would declare the country a ""threat"" to national security - a label already given to Russia. She also was reported to have privately supported declaring China's actions against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjang a genocide. 
What the leadership is saying: President Zelensky tweeted his congratulations to Mr Sunak. ""I wish you to successfully overcome all the challenges facing British society and the whole world today. I'm ready to continue strengthening the Ukraine-UK strategic partnership together!"" he said. Oleksandr Kornienko, the First Deputy Chairman of Ukraine's parliament, said he welcomed Mr Sunak as a ""colleague"". He added: ""Congratulations to the people of Great Britain on the fact that they have political stability again. After a short stage of turbulence.""
What the press is saying: The Glavkom website said both Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson would have been ""good news"" for Ukraine. Mr Sunak's remarks on Ukraine so far have been ""promising"", the website said, contrasting his statement in a debate that he does not want to meet Vladimir Putin with Liz Truss's readiness to speak to the Russian president. 
kground: UK policy towards Ukraine will not change under Mr Sunak. During the summer leadership contest, he said he would continue backing Ukraine, and make an early visit to Kyiv. But while Ms Truss promised to increase defence spending from 2% to 3% of national wealth - measured by gross domestic product - by 2030, Mr Sunak has said that target was ""arbitrary"" and ""not a plan"".
What the leadership is saying:  Russia sees no reason to expect relations with the UK to improve under Mr Sunak, the Kremlin said on Tuesday. 
What the press is saying:  All three main TV channels - the state's official Rossiya 1, state-controlled Channel One, and Gazprom-Media's NTV - have pointed out that Mr Sunak was elected unopposed.  TV's London correspondent Liza Gerson said this was an example of ""British democracy not for everyone"" - with Sunak voted in by so few that it amounted to a statistical ""margin of error"". Channel One correspondent Timur Siraziyev said Mr Sunak was toeing his party's line on Ukraine - ""to keep the conflict in Ukraine going as long as possible"" - and it was therefore ""not to be expected that with the advent of the new prime minister, relations between our countries will improve"".
kground: Russia-UK relations have soured even further since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. The UK responded with several rounds of sanctions, and it is one of the main backers of President Zelensky. The UK has also provided substantial military support to Ukraine. 
What the leadership is saying: Treasurer Jim Chalmers called Mr Sunak a great friend of Australia. ""I don't think it's insignificant a country like the United Kingdom has its first prime minister of colour,"" he said. 
What the press is saying: ""Sunak — one of the richest men in the House of Commons — may not be breaking the Tory tradition of elevating Oxford-educated elites, but his leadership will be historic. He will be Britain's first prime minister of colour.""
kground: Mr Sunak previously criticised the trade deal with Australia and New Zealand that Liz Truss negotiated as trade secretary, calling it ""one-sided"", and saying the UK ""shouldn't be rushing to sign trade deals as quickly as possible""."	/news/uk-63378673

politics	Sri Lanka down to last day of petrol, new prime minister says	"Sri Lanka's new prime minister says the country is down to its last day of petrol as it faces its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years.
In a televised address, Ranil Wickremesinghe said the nation urgently needs $75m (£60.8m) of foreign currency in the next few days to pay for essential imports.
He said the central bank would have to print money to pay government wages.
Mr Wickremesinghe also said state-owned Sri Lankan Airlines may be privatised. 
's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, rising energy prices, and populist tax cuts. A chronic shortage of foreign currency and soaring inflation had led to a severe shortage of medicines, fuel and other essentials. 
Ravindu Perera, who lives in the capital Colombo, said he and his family had begun searching for fuel before daybreak on Monday.
""We went to several fuel stations and most of them were closed. At around 5.30am we took a chance and joined a queue at Townhall which is the station usually providing fuel for government vehicles,"" he told the BBC. 
""It was less crowded - but the queue gradually grew to about 2km long. We were lucky enough to get fuel around 9.00am once fuel was delivered.""
He said his friends outside the capital were having to wait even longer. ""I'm working from home now to try and save fuel because who knows when I'll get a full tank again.""
Auto rickshaws, the most popular means of transport in Colombo, and other vehicles have been queuing at petrol stations around the capital.
""At the moment, we only have petrol stocks for a single day. The next couple of months will be the most difficult ones of our lives,"" said Mr Wickremesinghe in Monday's address. 
However, shipments of petrol and diesel using a credit line with India could provide fuel supplies in the next few days, he added.
Mr Wickremesinghe, who was appointed prime minister last Thursday, said the country's central bank would have to print money to help meet the government's wage bill and other commitments.
""Against my own wishes, I am compelled to permit printing money in order to pay state-sector employees and to pay for essential goods and services. However, we must remember that printing money leads to the depreciation of the rupee,"" he said.
PM Ranil Wickramasinghe: ""There won't be a hunger crisis""
He also proposed selling off Sri Lankan Airlines as part of efforts to stabilise the nation's finances. The carrier lost 45 billion Sri Lankan rupees ($129.5m; £105m) in the year ending March 2021.
In recent weeks, there have been large, sometimes violent, protests against President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his family.
Last week, the president's elder brother Mahinda resigned as prime minister after government supporters clashed with protesters. Nine people died and more than 300 were wounded in the violence. 
On Friday, Mr Wickremesinghe told the BBC, that the economic crisis is ""going to get worse before it gets better"". 
In his first interview since taking office, he also pledged to ensure families would get three meals a day.
Appealing to the world for more financial help, he said ""there won't be a hunger crisis, we will find food"".

health	China Covid: How many cases and deaths are there?	"re is concern over the spread of Covid in China following the recent easing of strict lockdown measures.
re have been reports that hospitals across the country are under pressure amid a fresh wave of infections.
Officially, there have only been 13 Covid deaths throughout December.
However, China has limited criteria for confirming Covid-19 deaths, which only includes those who die directly from respiratory illnesses caused by coronavirus, and not deaths caused by its knock-on effects. 
unting method does not correspond with WHO guidance, and results in a figure that is way below the death toll in many other countries.
China has already stopped mass testing and it is only recording positive cases at hospitals and fever clinics where the patient has Covid symptoms. Asymptomatic cases and positive results from home testing kits are not recorded in the data. 
Currently the official count only records about 5,000 cases a day.
UK-based research company Airfinity said its model estimates cases in China could reach more than three million a day in January.
Despite the official numbers being low, the World Health Organization has warned the healthcare system in China could be under severe pressure.
Reuters have reported that Chinese hospitals have been overwhelmed during the Christmas period, with footage showing long queues for clinics and patients on hospital beds in the middle of busy waiting rooms.
Videos have been emerging on social media throughout December appearing to show crowded hospitals.
By cross-referencing with other images posted online, the BBC has been able to verify two videos of overcrowding at a children's hospital in the city of Tianjin in northern China.
However we have not been able to verify many of the other videos which have emerged. 
It's difficult to confirm how severe the situation is compared with normal as China strictly controls information coming out of the country.
BBC's team in Beijing have reported on long queues outside health clinics, and on the high demand for fever remedies at pharmacies.
mporary health centres are being set up along with intensive care facilities across the country.
National broadcaster CCTV has reported that Beijing's Chaoyang Hospital will boost its capability as the number of incoming patients increased by fourfold.
It's also been reported that in Shanghai an extra 230,000 hospital beds have been made available. 
re has been a sudden lifting of many of China's Covid restrictions following November's protests against strict lockdowns across the country.
Before the recent relaxation, China had one of the toughest anti-Covid regimes in the world - known as its zero-Covid policy. 
measures included strict lockdowns even if only a handful of Covid cases had been found, mass testing in places where cases were reported, and people with Covid having to isolate at home or under quarantine at government facilities.
Lockdowns have now been scrapped, and quarantine rules have been abolished.
A negative Covid test is no longer required to enter public transport, restaurants, gyms and other public buildings (with the exception of orphanages and care homes).
Chinese authorities have also said they will fully open borders from 8 January with no travel restrictions or quarantine measures for arrivals.
Several countries including the US have imposed Covid testing on visitors from China due to its ongoing Covid surge.
Overall, China says more than 90% of the population has been fully vaccinated. 
However, less than half of people aged 80 and over have received three doses of vaccine. The vaccination rate back in April among this age group was much lower - less than 20%.  
uthorities now say they require local health services to ""strengthen immunization of the whole population, particularly the elderly"".
re are doubts over whether the main vaccines used in China - Sinovac and Sinopharm - are effective against Omicron, the most widespread strain.
China has refused to use Western vaccines widely.
government has given no official explanation. However, national pride may be a factor according to Dr Yu Jie, Senior Research Fellow on China at the international affairs think tank Chatham House:
""I think it's Xi Jinping really thinking of things in terms of economic self-reliance - that need to have China produce and use its own vaccine, rather than import it from somewhere.""

politics	Rishi Sunak: Leaders react to next Conservative PM	"Politicians and other leaders have been reacting to news that Rishi Sunak is to be the new prime minister. 
He faces a number of challenges including a cost-of-living crisis, a war in Europe as well as pressure to get Stormont working again.
In May, Sinn Féin was returned as the assembly's largest party, however, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) blocked the forming of an executive.
DUP withdrew in protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
As it stands, unless an executive is formed by 00:01 BST on Friday 28 October, people in Northern Ireland could, once again, be heading to the polls.
Mr Sunak has received a mixed reaction from the Stormont party leaders and senior politicians in the Republic of Ireland.
Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O'Neill has said Rishi Sunak must ""prioritise the restoration of the executive"" and ""respect democracy"".
""In May, people voted for change. To make politics work,"" she said, referencing her party's success in the assembly election when it was returned with the most number of seats.
""I've been ready to form an executive with others to help workers and families under real pressure with the cost of living crisis.""
Sir Jeffrey Donaldson congratulated Mr Sunak on his victory in the Conservative leadership contest and said the challenge for the new PM remains to deal with the Northern Ireland Protocol.
DUP leader said Mr Sunak must ""restore Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom"". 
""There may be a focus on the unity of the Conservative Party, but the unity of our United Kingdom must be protected,"" Sir Jeffrey said.  
""If the prime minister wants to see a fully-functioning Stormont, then he must deal with it once and for all. 
""Delivering that solution would be a very powerful signal that that he is focused on building a better future for everyone.""
Alliance leader Naomi Long said Mr Sunak ""must prioritise reform of the institutions to end ransom politics"" and called on him to ""take the opportunity to have a fresh approach to Northern Ireland"".
""The lack of an executive is compounding the cost-of-living crisis and the unprecedented pressures on our public services and finances,"" Ms Long said. 
""Rishi Sunak needs to recognise, even if a solution to the protocol can be agreed with the EU, there remains an inherent instability at the heart of our institutions.""
Ms Long described the protocol as ""only the latest in a long line of grievances to have collapsed Stormont"" and called for reform of the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland.
Alliance leader said the prospect of fresh Stormont elections, with or without a deal on the Northern Ireland Protocol, ""solves nothing"".
Doug Beattie said that one of the new prime minister's priorities ""must be resolving the political impasse"" and ""dealing with the issues caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol"". 
Ulster Unionist leader said: ""Northern Ireland cannot continue to be used as political football between the United Kingdom and the EU. 
""The Protocol must be replaced with a deal that works for everyone.""
Mr Beattie said that ""everyone knows what needs to be done and now is the time to be getting on with it"".
Colum Eastwood branded the process in which Rishi Sunak succeeds Liz Truss as prime minister as a ""farce"".
Mr Eastwood said Mr Sunak had no mandate to serve as prime minister and urged him to call a general election. 
""It is completely illegitimate and an affront to democracy for the Tories to elevate Rishi Sunak to the position of prime minister with no mandate whatsoever,"" the SDLP leader said. 
""Mr Sunak's predecessors have completely destroyed the public's confidence in politics and public service and wrecked the economy.
""He should not be allowed another two years to desperately attempt to clean up their mess.""
Jim Allister said the new prime minister's actions on the Northern Ireland Protocol will determine ""how we will judge him"".
UV leader said the protocol is a ""core constitutional issue which he must deal with"" and said this ""sovereignty issue"" will determine the future of Stormont.
(Irish PM) congratulated Mr Sunak on becoming Tory leader, saying: ""I look forward to working with you, as British PM, on the important issues we face on these islands, and globally.""
ánaiste [Irish deputy prime minister] Leo Varadkar said he looked forward to working with Mr Sunak.
In a tweet, Mr Vardakar said: ""These are challenging times of war, inflation, global uncertainty. I look forward to the UK working with Ireland and the EU as friends and allies in the years ahead.""
European Council President Charles Michel offered his congratulations to Rishi Sunak. 
With UK-EU talks ongoing over the Northern Ireland Protocol, Mr Michel said in a tweet: ""Working together is the only way to face common challenges... and bringing stability is key to overcoming them.""
Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said the Irish government would work ""in partnership"" with Rishi Sunak's administration in response to the collapse of power sharing in Northern Ireland, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reports.
Speaking in Galway on Monday, Mr Coveney hoped both governments would work with the DUP to see if an executive could be formed to avoid an ""unnecessary election""."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63376833
business	Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng hails 'new era' as he unveils tax cuts	"Watch: Stamp duty to income tax - What to know about Kwarteng's 'new era'
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has unveiled the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years, as he hailed a ""new era"" for the UK economy. 
Income tax and the stamp duty on home purchases will be cut and planned rises in business taxes have been scrapped.
Mr Kwarteng said a major change of direction was needed to kick start economic growth.
But Labour said it would not solve the cost-of-living crisis and was a ""plan to reward the already wealthy"".
It comes as the Bank of England warns the UK may already be in recession.
und sank to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar as the chancellor gave his statement. 
In a departure from Boris Johnson's economic policies, Mr Kwarteng has scrapped plans to push up taxes to pay for public services, with the aim of boosting economic growth.
In a Commons statement, being dubbed a mini-budget, he said high tax rates ""damage Britain's competitiveness"", reducing the incentive to work and for businesses to invest. 
He announced that the basic rate of income tax would be reduced by one percentage point to 19% in April - one year earlier than planned. 
He also unveiled a cut to the top rate of income tax from 45% to 40%, meaning the UK will have a single higher rate from April. 
Other measures include:
Mr Kwarteng fulfilled promises to reverse the rise in National Insurance payments introduced by Mr Johnson to pay for social care and tackle the NHS backlog.
He confirmed a planned corporation tax increase from 19% to 25% would also be scrapped.
f the permanent tax cuts announced by the chancellor are estimated at almost £45bn by 2027, which the chancellor said would ""turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth"". 
""We need a new approach for a new era, focused on growth,"" he added. 
Government borrowing will increase by £72bn as a result of the announcements, according to the Treasury. 
ges to income tax do not apply in Scotland but cuts to corporation tax and national insurance are UK-wide.
Paul Johnson, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the statement amounted to the biggest tax cuts since the 1972 Budget, with the cuts 50% bigger than had been expected. 
He said that the UK could be borrowing £120bn in three years' time to afford the measures.
Mr Johnson added that the plans were a ""big gamble"", with money being pumped into the economy when inflation remains high. However, he said they were ""manageable"" if economic growth ""really picks up"". 
mini-budget. This is a radical tax-cutting economic intervention, which is a significant change of course. 
Boris Johnson's tax plans have been junked. Many households will save some money, but some of the biggest tax cuts will be for those with the biggest salaries. 
And this will cost a lot of money.
r's calculation is that it's worth it. People need help with bills and slashing tax will stimulate growth. If you grow the economy, there will be more tax raised and that will help pay the debt in the medium term.
But many are sceptical it will work. 
Senior Conservatives have been warning for months that the strategy is wrong and will saddle future generations with debt. 
Opposition parties believe the government has the wrong priorities with tax cuts for the wealthy and should be raising more money from a windfall tax on energy company profits.
reasury hasn't said when it expects to achieve its desired economic growth.
But the chancellor is determined to press ahead with a radical change of direction. The big question now: will it work?
Labour described his statement as ""an admission of 12 years of economic failure"". 
""The Conservatives cannot solve the cost-of-living crisis, the Conservatives are the cost-of-living crisis, and our country cannot afford them anymore,"" shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said. 
""The chancellor has made clear who his priorities are today. Not a plan for growth. A plan to reward the already wealthy. A return to the trickle-down of the past. Back to the future, not a brave new era.""
Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""This was the billionaire's budget, showing the Conservatives are completely out of touch with families struggling to pay the bills.""
Watch: Labour says Tories created 'vicious circle of stagnation'
ment also included details of the cost of the government's plan to cap energy bills for households and businesses.
Mr Kwarteng said these estimated costs were ""particularly uncertain, given volatile energy prices"" but based on recent prices the total cost of the package for the six months from October was expected to be around £60bn. 
""We expect the cost to come down as we negotiate new, long-term energy contracts with suppliers,"" he added. 
government normally releases an independent forecast of how major tax changes will impact the economy, but Mr Kwarteng has opted not to do this, as his statement is not technically a Budget.
However, Mr Kwarteng promised the Office for Budget Responsibility would publish a full economic forecast before the end of the year, with a second to follow in the new year. 
uge increase in borrowing comes at a time when inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 40-year high, leading to higher interest payments. 
On Thursday the Bank of England raised interest rates from 1.75% to 2.25% - the highest level for 14 years - in an attempt to cool soaring prices.

business	EasyJet holiday bookings up despite cost-of-living crisis	"People are protecting their spending on holidays despite the cost-of-living crisis, the boss of EasyJet has said.
Johan Lundgren told the BBC the airline had seen strong demand for flights over half term, Christmas and New Year despite the ""pressure"" on households.
However, he said demand outside peak periods remained below usual levels.
It came as the low-cost carrier reported a sharp bounceback in sales and narrowed its losses for the year to 30 September.
mpany said it had faced ""multiple headwinds"" in the period, including Covid restrictions and the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which drove up fuel prices.
However, Mr Lundgren told the BBC's Today programme that there was ""a great deal of pent-up demand"" this summer despite the uncertainty surrounding the state of the economy.
""At the same time we see there is a strong demand in the peak periods,"" he said, adding that budget airlines tended to do well in downturns because ""people gravitate towards value"".
According to a survey of 2,000 people conducted by EasyJet, 64% plan to fly abroad in 2023, while 70% said that they would prioritise a holiday over other expenditure in their yearly budget.
Many said they would cut back on other discretionary spending, such as eating out or buying new clothes, to ensure they could travel abroad.
However, Mr Lungren said the airline needed to do more to ""stimulate"" demand outside peak periods and there were ""big cost increases coming towards the industry"".
Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is running at a 41-year high in the UK, as energy and food prices have soared.
EasyJet said that, like all airlines, it faced cost pressures including higher fuel costs, a stronger US dollar and demands for higher wages. 
Mr Lundgren declined to say how much ticket prices for next summer could rise by.
Rival budget carrier Ryanair has said its prices are rising, with boss Michael O'Leary warning that the era of the €10 ticket is over.
rline's average fare would rise from around €40 (£33.75) last year to roughly €50 over the next five years, he told the BBC in August.
According to a recent BBC survey of more than 4,000 adults, 85% are worried about the rising cost of living, up from 69% in a similar poll in January.
As a result, nine in 10 people are trying to save money by delaying putting the heating on."	/news/business-63791613
technology	Elon Musk: Twitter won't 'take yes for an answer'	"Billionaire Elon Musk has said he aims to complete his purchase of Twitter by the end of the month, but the company ""will not take yes for an answer"".
In a court filing, he said the social media platform had raised concerns about the ""theoretical possibility of a future failure to obtain debt financing"" to pay for the deal.
witter said it did not trust that the offer would come through. 
witter sued Mr Musk in July after he tried to back out of buying the firm.
judge overseeing the case gave the two sides until 28 October to work out a deal, agreeing to put legal proceedings on hold at the request of Mr Musk.
Mr Musk said litigation was no longer necessary, after he said in a surprise move this week that he was prepared to go forward with the original takeover plan, pending receipt of the financing and an end to the legal battle.
""There is no need for an expedited trial to order defendants to do what they are already doing,"" Mr Musk's attorneys wrote in a filing.
""Yet, Twitter will not take yes for an answer. Astonishingly they have insisted on proceeding with this litigation, recklessly putting the deal at risk and gambling with their stockholders interests.""
In its own filing for Delaware Chancery Court on Thursday, Twitter said it was opposed to suspending litigation, calling such a move ""an invitation to further mischief and delay.""
It said it did not trust Mr Musk's promises, noting that one bank helping to finance the deal had testified this week that it had not received any notice from Mr Musk about plans to move forward.
""Defendants can and should close next week,"" the company wrote. ""Until defendants commit to close as required, Twitter is entitled to its day in court.""
Mr Musk announced a plan to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in April. But he backed away from the deal just a few weeks later saying he was concerned that spam accounts on the platform were higher than Twitter had claimed.
witter ultimately sued to force Mr Musk to complete the deal. 
In its lawsuit, Twitter argued Mr Musk was worried about the price he had agreed to pay, after a sharp downturn in the value of tech shares, including Tesla, the electric car company he leads and is the base of much of his wealth.            
Mr Musk was due to be questioned this week as part of the preparation for the trial, which was scheduled to begin 17 October. The trial is now postponed to 28 October to allow a deal to close, according to a court filing. 
Shares in Twitter ended the day down more than 3%, amid investor doubts the deal will go through."	/news/business-63166568
technology	Tory MP Julian Knight warns of face-offs with Musk's Twitter	"Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter could lead to multiple ""face-offs"" with regulators in the UK and the EU, a senior Conservative MP has warned.  
Select committee chair Julian Knight said Mr Musk's support for ""absolute free speech"" could mean governments were faced with repeated calls to widen their regulation of online content.
He told the BBC it would be a case of ""watch and see"".  
On Thursday, it emerged the UK's Online Safety Bill had again been delayed.  
gislation is aimed at making social media firms like Twitter and Facebook accountable for finding and removing harmful content.
Children's charities say it is urgently needed to protect young people from abuse - but civil liberties groups argue it is an attack on free speech.
mammoth bill was put on hold during the summer's Tory leadership contest, amid claims it would be watered down.
Mr Musk has previously spoken of wanting to make Twitter an unfiltered ""common digital town square"", sparking fears the platform could become more abusive and polarised. 
After completing his takeover, he tweeted ""the bird [Twitter's logo] is freed"".  Thierry Breton, EU commissioner for the internal market, responded: ""In Europe, the bird will fly by our rules"".
Under the EU's recently approved Digital Services Act, online platforms which fail to curb illegal online content will face hefty fines.  
But Mr Knight, who chairs the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, told the BBC the billionaire had a record of ""rowing back"" on some of his previous statements and had done so again on Friday. 
Mr Musk said: ""Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences"", adding that it would follow ""the laws of the land"" and ""must be warm and welcoming to all"".  
Online Safety Bill would compel social media platforms to remove all illegal content and to take action against designated ""legal but harmful"" material. 
Companies could face fines running into billions of pounds or have access to their sites blocked if they breach the rules. 
During Liz Truss's brief premiership, Commons leader Penny Mordaunt told MPs the bill would return to Parliament for its remaining stages on 1 November. 
But on Thursday, she confirmed it had been pulled from the Parliamentary schedule.
She told MPs the legislation ""remains a priority"", but the government needed to ""ensure that there is time for members to properly look at amendments"".
Another Conservative member of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, former senior cabinet minister Damian Green, told the BBC the bill appeared to be ""up in the air both in terms of content and timing"".  
Mr Knight suggested the legislation drawn up by Boris Johnson's government had been too wide-ranging and needed greater focus. 
He predicted that the protection of children from harmful content and age verification measures would be ""beefed up"", while potentially harmful but legal content for adults might fall outside the bill's scope.    
On Thursday, Labour's Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire questioned whether the bill had been withdrawn by new prime minister Rishi Sunak to ""appease"" International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch.
When she was a Tory leadership candidate in July, Ms Badenoch said the Bill in its current form should not become law. If elected, she would ""ensure the Bill doesn't overreach"", she added.
Ms Debbonaire said Parliament had been waiting four years for the Bill to become law. 
""Since the Conservatives first announced their intention to regulate seven other jurisdictions have introduced online safety laws, and in the UK in that time online crime has exploded, child sexual abuse online has become rife, scams have proliferated.
""Every day that goes by without the Bill the suffering continues."" 
Ms Mordaunt insisted the government was ""committed"" to the Bill and it would ""be back in the House shortly"". 
Ian Russell - the father of Molly, 14, who ended her life after viewing self-harm content online - warned the further delay could ""cost vulnerable young lives"". 
He added: ""I hope the assurances I have been given by the Secretary of State [Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Michelle Donelan] that the Bill will be in the Lords by Christmas will prove to be more than just fine words.
""For the sake of our young, who are currently exposed to online dangers on a daily basis, this legislation can't come soon enough.""
Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation, said: ""Each day this crucial legislation is delayed is another day imagery of children being sexually abused spreads further online. This is the reality.
""Our hotline analysts see the consequences, and last year they removed more images and videos of children suffering sexual abuse and rape from the internet than ever before.
""We need to see a clear timetable of when this bill will proceed to give victims the confidence that this Bill is still a Government priority."" 
Free speech campaigners have called for the legislation to be scrapped. 
Monica Horten, policy manager of the Open Rights Group, said: ""The privacy of 40 million chat users is threatened by this Bill.
""There will be constant surveillance of what they say and send. The Bill will create everyday censorship where the Computer Says No to perfectly legal content, with no proper process of review."" "	/news/uk-politics-63426734
entertainment	Maxine Peake stages Betty Boothroyd's life in comedy musical: 'This is me letting rip'	"first female Speaker of the House of Commons is having her life story told on stage - but rather than being a dry political drama, it sees actor Maxine Peake sing in her first musical and return to her comedy roots.
Betty Boothroyd never fulfilled her youthful dreams of high-kicking her way to showbiz stardom.
She discovered she wasn't cut out to be a chorus-line showgirl at the London Palladium, so her stint as a member of the Tiller Girls dance troupe after World War Two was short-lived.
But her flair for performing wasn't wasted.
She moved onto a different public stage when she pursued her other passion, politics, and ended up with a starring role in the House of Commons as the first Madam Speaker from 1992 to 2000.
Betty Boothroyd's pitch to become the first woman Speaker in 1992
""Politicians, like Tiller Girls, are public performers,"" she wrote in her autobiography. ""They forget it at their peril.""
Maxine Peake agrees. ""The worlds of politics and theatre, I think, do collide,"" she says. ""My granddad always used to say to me, 'Politicians, Maxine, are frustrated actors.' And she really has that charisma and presence.""
Betty (now Baroness) Boothroyd is admired for the way she worked the crowd in the Commons. That has inspired Peake and co-writer and co-star Seiriol Davies to tell her life story on stage.
""We just felt she was someone to celebrate,"" Peake says. ""You look at her achievements. It's what she stands for, and her work ethic, what she achieved, what her beliefs were. 
""And then when you start with somebody who used to be a Tiller Girl, you think, well, this could be fun, especially for a musical.""
As well as deciding against the predictable idea of a straight and serious biographical play, the title of Peake and Davies's show suggests it isn't quite a regular musical either.
Betty! A Sort of Musical opened at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre on Saturday. The ""sort of"" in the name refers to the fact it's a show within a show - following an amateur dramatic group in Lady Boothroyd's home town of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, who are themselves attempting to stage a musical about their local heroine.
Each member of the fictional Dewsbury Players takes turns to portray Lady Boothroyd and perform a song about a different stage of her life. Each tune goes on a different flight of fantasy, with Grease and James Bond-themed numbers and a Queen-inspired Boothroydian Rhapsody.
""If we're in a Bond film or a kitchen sink drama, they all then get elevated to the level of absurdity,"" Davies explains.
He adds: ""We make no promises that things are biographically factually correct, although we think there is some truth in all of the moments. But it is not a bio-musical. It is a musical about people making myths about a woman they love.""
Davies says he was inspired by Lady Boothroyd's general ""fabulousness"" as well as her ""explicit glamour and showmanship"".
On top of that: ""I think she's a unifying figure. If someone has heard of Betty, the chances are they'll at least admire her, or if not, be slightly obsessed with her.
""But if someone hasn't heard of her, I just have to tell them she used to be kick-line chorus girl and the KGB tried to honeytrap her, and then she rose to the second-highest commoner rank in the land or whatever.
""That is a story, whatever side your bread is buttered politically.""
racters in the Dewsbury am-dram group have their bread buttered on various sides, but they agree Lady Boothroyd is, as Peake believes too, a symbol of democratic respectability and stability compared with today's politicians.
""She unified the House of Commons with her skill and wit and intelligence. I felt very much I've missed that.""
Peake plays Meredith Ankle, matriarch of the am-dram group and owner of Ankle Carpets. It's hard not to detect the influence of Victoria Wood - who gave Peake her first break in Dinnerladies - in the way she is mining humour from the most mundane situations.
""She's such a big inspiration, even before I worked with her, growing up,"" Peake says of her late mentor.
Betty! is a return to comedy for Peake, who has gone on to forge her career mainly in serious (and often harrowing) dramas like Three Girls, about the Rotherham child sex grooming scandal; Anne, playing Hillsborough campaigner Anne Williams; and Mike Leigh's historical tub-thumper Peterloo.
""Initially, I wasn't Meredith when we first started writing,"" Peake says. ""And then the more I wrote, the more I really wanted to play Meredith, because it's something I've been crying out to do for a long time.
""I started in comedy, and I thought that's where I'd continue. And then I sort of went, 'Oh I'd like to try some straight, serious drama.' And then I couldn't quite get back. So this is me letting rip.
""As a youngster, that's what I thought my career would be, as I got into middle age. But there's not as many of those parts written now for women - those larger-than-life funny women. We've lost Victoria Wood.""
w show also requires Peake to sing. Has she been in a musical before? ""Have I heck. I'm not a singer.""
She is, it must be noted, in a band called The Eccocentric Research Council, although her vocal delivery with them is more like spoken word. ""Sort of"" musical again.
""What is nice, at the grand old age of 48, is going, OK, I'm going to do something where I sing, and there's ways around it, and I've learned so much.""
Lady Boothroyd isn't the first politician to get the musical treatment. Evita and Hamilton haven't done badly, but recent shows about British political figures have had mixed results.
Like with Betty!, an exclamation mark was deployed for Tony! (The Tony Blair Rock Opera), co-written by comedian Harry Hill. Blair is more divisive, and the show was less affectionate and less subtle. ""The show struggles to shift out of a cartoon register,"" The Telegraph said.
Veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner was the subject of The Palace of Varieties, and setting his ""colourful Commons battles"" to a soundtrack of music hall and Broadway songs ""makes surprising sense"", The Guardian said.
Skinner makes an appearance in Betty! too. This time, the Beast of Bolsover and Madam Speaker perform a verbal joust in the form of a rap battle.

business	Covid: Qantas says pandemic 'existential crisis' is over	"rriers of Australia and New Zealand say that the worst of the coronavirus crisis is now behind them, even as they posted annual losses for a third year in a row.
Qantas says it is seeing demand increase ""with the existential crisis posed by the pandemic now over"".
Air New Zealand says it has also experienced ""a very strong recovery in bookings and revenues"" since March.
Both countries had imposed some of the world's strictest pandemic travel bans.
Qantas said in a statement on Thursday that its underlying loss before tax had widened to A$1.86bn ($1.3bn; £1.1bn) in the year to the end of June, from the previous year.
mpany said it had lowered its net debt to a better than expected A$3.94bn.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said ""the speed and scale of that recovery has been exceptional"".
""Our teams have done an amazing job through the restart and our customers have been extremely patient as the whole industry has dealt with sick leave and labour shortages in the past few months,"" Mr Joyce added.
Australia reopened its borders to international visitors in February. That marked a closure of nearly two years.
Like much of the global airline industry, Qantas has been struggling to resume its services as borders reopened. 
It asked senior executives to work as baggage handlers at the Sydney and Melbourne airports to tackle an acute labour shortage.
Analysis by Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Brisbane
With vast distances and lack of a decent inter-city rail network (even between Sydney and Melbourne, one of the busiest air routes in the world) flying is the only realistic way to get around Australia if you're in a hurry.
But as traveller demand bounces back, it hasn't always been a particularly enjoyable experience.
On a recent Qantas flight out of Sydney, my fellow passengers surged to get on board with a fervour I'd never seen. But it became clear why.
f lost and delayed baggage have been so commonplace that, perhaps understandably, flyers are not risking putting luggage in the hold. 
Instead they're scrabbling for overhead locker space. Finding somewhere, even for a laptop bag, was a real test of my Tetris skills.
An hour's delay on the tarmac didn't help anyone's mood, but we were the lucky ones. Departure boards are littered with last-minute cancelations as airlines struggle with crew phoning in sick, as flu and Covid continue to be a strain.
Other airlines have struggled with staffing and baggage issues too. But as the national carrier, Qantas is the most high profile. And having laid off thousands of baggage handlers during the pandemic, it is an easy target.
Earlier this week, under-fire chief executive Alan Joyce was on the front foot - wielding not only apologies, but discount vouchers, lounge passes and status extensions for those frequent flyers which underpin the business.
results suggest its problem is not so much tempting people back in the air. The pick up in bookings shows that people want to travel again. 
In time that will help repair its balance sheet. But just as urgently, Qantas knows it needs to fix its reputation.
Also on Thursday, Air New Zealand said that its pre-tax losses had risen to NZ$725m ($449.8m; £380.7m) in the year to the end of June.
However, operating revenue jumped by 9% to NZ$2.7bn over the same period.
Air New Zealand chief executive Greg Foran said the firm was in the ""revive"" phase of its Covid-19 turnaround.
""When travel restrictions began to lift in March the company recorded a very strong recovery in bookings and revenues,"" Mr Foran said.
""This trend continues, with high booking levels through July and August,"" he added.
New Zealand fully opened its borders to travellers earlier this month for the first time since March 2020.

health	China Covid: Beijing eases some curbs despite rising cases	"China has slightly relaxed some of its Covid restrictions even as case numbers rise to their highest levels in months.
Quarantine for close contacts will be cut from seven days in a state facility to five days and three days at home.
Officials will also stop recording secondary contacts - meaning many people will avoid having to quarantine.
ght easing comes weeks after Xi Jinping was re-instated as party leader for a historic third term.
Mr Xi held his first Covid meeting with his newly elected Standing Committee on Thursday. 
China's zero-Covid policy has saved lives in the country of 1.4 billion people but also dealt a punishing blow to the economy and ordinary people's lives.
re is increasing public fatigue over lockdowns and travel restrictions. 
Stories of suffering and desperation have also circulated on social media, fuelling many outbursts of civic anger.
China's National Health Commission (NHC) insisted the changes did not amount to ""relaxing prevention and control, let alone opening up"", but were instead designed to adapt to a changing Covid situation.
NHC also said it would develop a plan to speed up vaccinations.
On Friday, the changes were announced even as the country grapples with its worst wave of Covid in months.
f Beijing, Guangzhou and Zhengzhou are currently seeing record numbers. 
On Thursday, China recorded over 10,500 new Covid cases - the highest daily total since April when China shut down its largest city Shanghai to combat a wave there.
People in China, and analysts watching the country, have been waiting for some indication from the government that strict Zero-Covid measures might be eased.
On the one hand, Beijing is not officially backing down from its commitment to its current strategy, but it has announced a series of measures it has described as ""adapting"" to the situation rather than ""relaxing"" the policy.
For Chinese people who have become exhausted by Zero-Covid it doesn't really matter if the government finds the need to save face semantically, as long as the changes are real and that they are.
moves announced today may not seem like much if you are not living in China but, inside the country, three years into a crisis, with no indication of when or how an off ramp may appear, any steps towards re-opening are steps which are not going backwards.
Ending the punishment for airlines carrying infected passengers will mean more flights, more seats, cheaper inbound tickets, and an end to abrupt Covid-induced cancellations. This is significant.
A reduction of seven days in hotel quarantine plus three days at home to five days plus three is only a small alteration but the expectation is that this could continue to come down at some point in the future.
Again, for a country with an economy being smashed by Zero-Covid, baby steps are better than no steps.
Raising the bar for centralised quarantine inside China will also ease tensions for ordinary people, if only because it provides a glimmer of light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
It is hard to explain to people in other countries just how fed up with Zero-Covid locals have become. They were living through this crisis well before the rest of the world and while other countries have now found a way to move on, they're still stuck with it, as if China has been frozen in a massive 2020 time block.
Despite the small changes however, most restrictions still remain in place. Mr Xi has insisted on sticking to a stringent zero-Covid policy involving lockdowns even as the rest of the world has moved on. 
means in many cities residents have been subject to sudden restrictions on their movement and disruptions to work and schooling.
For example, this week in Guangzhou - the current epicentre of the Covid wave in China - locals in one district were barred from venturing outside and only one member of each household was allowed outside to grocery shop.
Public transport has been suspended while schools and workplaces are also shut down.
In Zhengzhou, another Covid centre at the moment, lockdowns there prompted many workers living at a vast factory owned by Taiwanese iPhone-maker Foxconn to flee the area on foot to escape restrictions."	/news/world-asia-china-63594255

Meggitt, based at Coventry's Ansty business park, was taken over by US firm Parker last month.
Parker Meggitt said the merger of the two businesses had meant some of the work previously undertaken at Meggitt may no longer be required, potentially affecting up to a 10th of the company's UK workforce.
Bosses are ""committed"" to reducing the impact of the changes, it has said.

A spokesman for the company said: ""Parker Meggitt is committed to a clear and transparent process with options to reduce the impact of the proposed changes, including the consideration of voluntary redundancy.""

technology	How to check if your Instagram posts are being hidden	"Instagram has launched a new tool to let you know if your posts are barred from being recommended to other users.
Previously, people were not told if intervention by a platform meant posts did not appear in other people's feeds - a process known as ""shadow banning"".
Instagram does not use that term. It says the new tool will inform users if there are restrictions on their account because they broke certain rules.
Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, said the decision was about ""transparency"".
""Sometimes your account can end up in a state where it's not eligible for your photos and videos to show up in [our] recommendations,"" he said. 
""If you have posted things that violate our 'recommendability' guidelines or recommendation guidelines... you can end up in a state where your content won't be recommended,"" Mr Mosseri explains.
Instagram users will be able to edit or delete posts which have fallen foul of the platform's rules. They will also be able to appeal to Instagram if they feel any content has been flagged in error.
People can check the status of their account in the Instagram app by selecting their profile, opening the menu, then selecting: settings, account, and account status.
Dr Carolina Are, a content moderation researcher at the Centre For Digital Citizens at Northumbria University, said Instagram has historically had a major issue with people having posts 'hidden' without their knowledge.
""The platform did not notify us about shadow banning,"" she said. ""For ages, Instagram denied that it was ever a thing.""
Dr Are is also a content creator on Instagram, where she often posts videos as a pole dance instructor - and says she has experienced so-called shadow banning herself.
""I personally received an apology [from Instagram] for the shadow ban of pole-dancing in 2019,"" she said. 
""They said the hashtags were blocked 'in error'... this is essentially shadow banning.""
Shadow banning can be a problem because if people are not told they have fallen foul of the rules, it means they're unable to appeal the decision or fix any mistake.
It can sometime lead to amusing consequences, with one Reddit user previously telling the BBC he didn't know he'd been shadow banned - and accidentally spent a year talking to himself.
re are some benefits to the practice, however. It allows big tech companies to block harmful content from spreading, limiting disinformation.
But Dr Are says her research has found it has had a disproportionate impact on marginalised communities.
""I think creators are very, very worried about shadow banning,"" she said. ""So it's only fair that Instagram is moving to do something about it.""
She said the problem is exacerbated by a lack of real people involved in the moderation process, which is often automated.
In her role as a researcher, Dr Are has spoken to people whose accounts were removed from Instagram due to violating its policies.
She claims to have spoken to some content creators who lost their accounts and tried to appeal, who said they weren't able to speak to a person involved in moderation.
""I still think it's a bit of a cosmetic and performative change,"" she said. ""As good as this is, without investing in human moderation, we are just going nowhere."""	/news/technology-63907699
sports	Top-ranked Gerwyn Price under 'a bit more pressure' at World Championship	"Gerwyn Price accepts he is under ""a bit more pressure"" going into the PDC World Darts Championship as world number one than at other tournaments.
37-year-old Welshman also hopes to avoid early round nerves as he tries to reclaim the title he won in 2021.
""The pressure's there on every single tournament, obviously a bit more with the World Championship.
""I think it's just the first round jitters if you know what I mean,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
Price will play Luke Woodhouse or Vladyslav Omelchenko in his opener on Monday, 19 December aiming to win and then come back ""all guns firing"" after the festive break.
He will go into action at Alexandra Palace having been at the venue throughout the weekend watching some of the games and practicing.
""I had a couple of exhibitions this week which I think I needed to give me a boost of confidence.
""I used a new set of darts, obviously it's the same set-up that I use, but a new set and I was playing really well so I'm going into this tournament full of confidence off the back of four really good days.
""The back end of this year has been really good to me, so fingers crossed I can get through the first round and have a good Christmas and then that's when the tournament really starts then I think, third round on.""
me around, Price hopes to share in success with his family and friends, having won the title by beating Gary Anderson in an empty venue due to the coronavirus pandemic.
""I was up there alone,"" said Price.
""I was in the hotel on my own most of the tournament to go into a World Championship Final, where the venue is obviously completely dead, even the practice room and it was quite eerie, really, and it wasn't nice.
""But it was great to win the tournament, but first and foremost is it will be good to have my family there obviously if I did reach the world final and managed to pick up the trophy again.
""But, yeah, obviously, I want the crowd there, I feed off the ground and I feed off the atmosphere.""
Price also reflected on ""a lot of ups and downs"" in 2022, including breaking a hand and ""struggling"" with his game.
""But I battled on and as soon as my hand got a little bit better my form started to come back, it did take a while and you know like I said as soon as I found that form it was sort of real me again.
""It was difficult for six months, but those are the periods you need to knuckle down and come through them.""
Price's compatriot Jonny Clayton is the seventh seed. Jim Williams, Robert Owen, Lewy Williams and Richie Burnett complete the list of Welsh competitors.
Burnett was the first of them in action, losing 3-2 against Czech Republic's Adam Gawlas on Saturday. Clayton will be the last to begin, on Friday, 23 December.

entertainment	Taylor Swift breaks Arctic Monkeys chart-topping streak	"r Swift has denied Arctic Monkeys their seventh straight chart-topping album, after her own new LP raced to number one on Friday.
Her 10th album, Midnights, became the fastest-selling record of 2022, with 204,000 equivalent sales in week one.
Sheffield rock band finished in second place with more than 100,000 chart sales in seven days for The Car.
would have been enough sales to reach number one in a normal week where there was no competition from Swift.
US singer more than doubled her previous best opening week album sales, which she achieved in 2014 for her album 1989.
Anti-Hero, the breakout hit from the 32-year-old's latest album, also topped this week's singles chart.
Suitably named Swift has now surpassed Harry Styles' third album Harry's House to record the UK's fastest-selling record of 2022 so far.
Perhaps even more notably, Swift has overtaken Madonna by setting a new chart record for the quickest succession of nine UK number one albums by a female artist.
She managed it in 10 years flat, while it took the Madonna 21 years to achieve the same feat. However, the Queen of Pop is still ahead of Swift on the overall league table for most number one albums.
Midnights is Swift's first original studio album in two years, and sees her return to a more mainstream sound following the acoustic tone of her previous two albums.
It was devoured by fans, breaking the record for the most-streamed album on Spotify in one day.
um was also met with rave reviews from critics, although some said its subdued tone meant it lacked potential hit singles.
w record retains some of the folksy charm of sister albums Folklore and Evermore, both released in 2020 during the pandemic. But it also sees her re-engage her pop sensibilities, with lyrics that explore more personal subject matters.
Some songs offer fans further insight into the star's normally low-key relationship with her boyfriend, English actor Joe Alwyn.
ght bump in the road during a glorious run this week came when her team re-edited a music video days after its release, following a backlash over one of the scenes.
In the original video for Anti-Hero - which this week knocked Sam Smith off top spot - the singer steps onto a scale that reads ""FAT"", as her alter ego shakes her head, seemingly in disappointment.
Recent Reading and Leeds headliners Arctic Monkeys will be disappointed not to have added to their collection of six number one albums, with the follow-up to their divisive Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, which marked a move towards a more expansive, cinematic sound.
Also released last Friday, The Car is tighter and more immediate than its predecessor but it spins in the same sonic universe, with beautifully crafted orchestral, soulful and at-times funky tracks like There'd Better Be a Mirror Ball and Body Paint.
""I made a big deal about the piano on the last record,"" singer Alex Turner recently told BBC music correspondent Mark Savage. ""But when I look at it now, the shift in sound between that record and the one before [AM] is more to do with the fact that my writing process [changed] around that time"".
""So the piano had a part in it, but being able to record myself and write to those recordings is perhaps what got us into this mess,"" he added.
Remarkably, all of this week's top five albums are new entries, meaning that, despite it being a particularly crowded field, there were still strong showings from Loyle Carner, Simple Minds and Kylie Minogue."	/news/entertainment-arts-63423816
entertainment	David Tennant jealous of incoming Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa	"Former Doctor Who star David Tennant says he's ""a little bit jealous"" of the incoming Doctor Ncuti Gatwa ""starting on this exciting journey.""
""Ncuti is brilliant,"" adds Tennant, who played the Doctor between 2005-2010. ""He's a lovely, lovely man and he's full of beans and he's really talented. I mean he's like scary-talented.
""So I'm thrilled for every Doctor Who fan for what's to come and I include myself in that number.""
In May the BBC announced that Tennant himself would be reprising the role as part of the show's 60th anniversary celebrations next year. Details are shrouded in secrecy but we know that he will be reunited with Catherine Tate, who played his companion Donna Noble.
And Tennant now tells the BBC how the reunion came about. ""It all slightly happened a little bit by accident,"" he reveals. And, strange as it may sound, Covid played a huge role. 
He, Tate and Russell T Davies, who was in charge of the hit sci-fi series between 2005 and 2009, got involved in Doctor Who: Lockdown! a worldwide series of online ""watch-alongs"" of previous episodes designed to pass the time during the pandemic, ""when everyone was locked in their house"".
""That's where this all started"", explains Tennant. 
""At a certain time and day everyone would press play on a certain episode and some of the people who had been involved in those episodes were tweeting along.
""I don't tweet but my wife helped me,"" he laughs.
rogramme, which is almost 60 years old, was being filmed in central Bristol
Afterwards the three of them ""were just having a text exchange and Catherine said, 'wouldn't it be fun to do it again?'""
He adds: ""Russell said, 'We could do a one off, maybe they'd let us'.""
""We said, 'yeah that would be a laugh,' and then it all went quiet.""
But last year Davies announced he was back as Doctor Who's showrunner. And Tennant and Tate received a surprising offer.
""Suddenly Russell let us know that he was taking over the show again and he would be back fully in charge and would we come and play a little bit for him?"" says Tennant.
""So I don't know if we gave him the idea to take Doctor Who back but certainly we thought if he's doing it, we can't let these young people have all the fun.""
Before we see him back on screen in Doctor Who though, Tennant is returning to the stage, for the first time in five years.
Next month he will star in CP Taylor's play Good, about a decent, respectable German professor, with a Jewish best friend, who becomes a high-ranking Nazi.
""When you look back at the historical events like what happened in Germany in the 1930s, yes there were some monsters but mostly it was a nation full of people that were as complex and different and broadly decent as most of us are,"" says Tennant. ""So what happened?"" 
was first performed in 1981, and in a revival at the Royal Exchange in Manchester in 2011, the Guardian's Lyn Gardner highlighted ""the fatal lack of dramatic tension in a play in which quite a nice man slips under with no struggle at all"".
But Tennant says Good will ask the audience hard questions because ""it sort of plonks you in the middle of this awful context and it makes you wonder how you would cope yourself"".
""One likes to think one is the true, virtuous crusading type of person. One fears one is the one that lets things slide past. [For instance] we are staring down the barrel of a terrible climate emergency, what am I really doing about that?""
And staging the work, the award-winning director Dominic Cooke says he has been struck by how timeless the themes of the play are. 
""What this play does is it allows you to identify with this very sort of decent, funny, charming person and watch him make compromises,"" he says. ""We all want to think that we are going to be the person that will stand up and say no when something terrible happens. 
""But the truth is that very few of us actually do.""
Good is on at London's Harold Pinter Theatre from 5 October to 24 December."	/news/entertainment-arts-63073710
