business	Rail strikes and flight cancellations: Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery?	"For travellers, the past fortnight has brought a tidal wave of bad news.
Cancelled flights, proposed rail strikes and record-breaking petrol prices have thrown people's plans into disarray - and now the peak summer holiday season and the long school break are hovering on the horizon. 
After more than two years of Covid restrictions, this should be a summer of fun. 
But are we now heading into a summer of misery? 
We take a look at where things stand for planes and trains over the weeks ahead.
UK air travel industry has just faced what is arguably its biggest test since coronavirus rules were lifted and it is fair to say, it has been a bumpy ride. 
Over the Jubilee bank holiday, which coincided with many schools' half-term breaks, 750 flights out of the UK were cancelled, according to aviation data firm Cirium. Around 466 return flights were axed.
Although cancellations made up a small percentage of total flights, many passengers were only informed at short notice and faced long queues to check-in bags and get through security.  
Staff shortages from job cuts made at the height of the pandemic have been driving cancellations and delays, heightening holidaymakers' anxiety that problems will continue into the key summer season.
Add to that the threat of strike action. British Airways workers have voted in favour of supporting industrial action, in a ballot conducted by the Unite union, while Ryanair is facing walkouts by staff in parts of Europe.
Jess Baker has been put off travelling abroad this summer after a recent ""nightmare"" 18-hour journey home from Iceland. 
She, her husband Shaun and their two children had their EasyJet flight into Luton cancelled on Monday.
were given the option to travel home on Thursday but needed to get back sooner so paid £1,000 to fly into Glasgow with Icelandair. They shelled out an additional £340 to hire a car to drive down to Luton to collect their own vehicle. 
""It's been an absolute nightmare,"" says Ms Baker. ""We quickly decided that we'll go camping here instead. It's not worth the hassle all over again."" 
Others may have the same idea. Sykes Holiday Cottages says it has seen a 22% rise in bookings in the past two weeks compared to the same period last year. 
Chief executive Graham Donoghue says it is ""at least in part due to widespread reports of overseas travel disruption"".
""Travellers simply don't want to have to tackle airports and take the risk that their family holidays could be cancelled,"" he says.
Since cutting staff, airlines, airports and the companies that provide baggage handling have been recruiting but because new workers have to pass security checks, it takes time.  
Heathrow airport's boss John Holland-Kaye recently told the Financial Times it could take up to 18 months for the aviation sector to ""fully recover capacity"".
Aviation consultant Chris Tarry tells the BBC the situation should improve as more staff are security cleared, but he warns there are ""unlikely to be enough workers in certain areas given wages and working conditions"".
And airports ""only work if all of the elements are in place"", he says.
Glastonbury Festival returns this year on 22 June, but it might not be that easy to get there now rail strikes have been announced. 
More than 40,000 RMT Union members from Network Rail and 13 train operators are set to walk out after talks over pay and redundancies broke down.
rikes are due to take place on 21, 23 and 25 June but it is likely services across the whole week will be disrupted. Train drivers are also going to hold their own strikes over pay.
Passengers have been advised not to travel on trains unless necessary during the strikes.
Zahid Fayyaz, a solicitor from Brixton who is planning to travel to Glastonbury by train, is worried about the impact the potential strikes might have.
He originally had a ticket for 23 June but because of the planned strike on that day he and his two friends have bought new tickets to travel the day before. It cost them £240 and an extra day off work.
""It's going to take an extra two hours, but aside from this I'll be fine. But other people won't be able to take time off work or afford the extra money,"" the 40-year-old says.
Mr Fayyaz says he is broadly sympathetic to the rail workers striking, but believes the ""timing is wrong"".
Glastonbury Festival is one of several events impacted by potential travel disruption, along with a cricket test match between England and New Zealand in Leeds.
Some people are switching their mode of transport to buses and coaches. Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express, said the firm had seen an increase in enquiries and bookings during the days of the rail strikes.
walkout could yet be called off if all parties can reach an agreement.
's what John Kuehne, from Fort Lauderdale in Florida, is hoping for.
He's traveling to England along with many of his friends from around the world to see prog-rock legends Yes, who are performing at London's Royal Albert Hall on 21 June.
But ""everything is up in the air"" now, he says. ""Car rentals, parking, fuel, tolls, and congestion zone fees make it very expensive and inconvenient.""
Mr Kuehne also happens to be arriving in the UK just as the cost of filling an average family car hit £100 for the first time. 
He says labour disputes happen but that ""all sides need to come together quickly to find a reasonable solution"". 
""What they do in the next two weeks will affect the lives of thousands of people who just want the wonderful experience of modern British mass transit."""	/news/business-61747449
politics	Tory leadership race: EU leaders fret the 'What's Next'	"Un tout petit peu de Schadenfreude there certainly is in EU circles at the spectacular demise of Prime Minister Liz Truss and the tumultuous state of UK politics.
Just take a look at the German political weekly Der Spiegel, its Friday front cover resplendent with an illustration of a banana whose tip morphs into London's famous Big Ben clock tower, adjacent to parliament. 
""Banana Island"" is a play on the term banana republic and the headline reads: ""How Britons made themselves the laughing stock of Europe.""
Brussels is still massaging a bruised ego following the Brexit process and the clear message they believe to have received from British leaders ever since that the UK was too good for the EU.
Media mockery aside, there's a lingering conviction in EU capitals that Brexit actually left both entities - the EU and the UK - weaker. Economically and in terms of security and defence on the world stage. More on that in a moment.
And behind closed doors, many European politicians point to the instability on glaring show in UK government circles as being directly linked, in their opinion, to ideological splits unleashed in Britain and Northern Ireland during the Brexit debate. 
But you won't be surprised to hear that it's hard to find an EU leader who'll say this on the record. 
've pretty much all laughed about Britain's Daily Star publication having set up a live webcam on a lettuce, to see whether it had a longer shelf-life than Liz Truss in No 10 Downing Street. Lettuce-gate was widely written about in European media and it was noted too here in Brussels that the deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, tweeted on Thursday, ""Bye bye @liztruss, congrats to lettuce.""
All that said, though, EU leaders need and want to work with the UK going forward. Whoever might be at the helm.
EU's former chief Brexit negotiator, Frenchman Michel Barnier, probably came closest to making a link with ""the B-word"" when he tweeted: ""Not all of these (UK) difficulties are due to Brexit, I am simply convinced that Brexit makes everything more difficult."" 
In fact, there's more EU hand-wringing than gleeful hand-rubbing right now, when purveying the political chaos in the UK.
News of Liz Truss's resignation after just 44 days as prime minister, following a much trumpeted, but real-world disastrous ""mini budget"", broke in Brussels just as EU leaders were making their way into a two-day summit.
re were raised eyebrows and the odd caustic comment about losing count of UK premiers.
Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel mused that he hoped he could remember how many British prime ministers he'd survived. Mr Bettel has been in government for a decade. (With a new UK prime minister due to be announced in a week, the answer would be five. Four in the last three years alone.) 
But EU leaders are more than aware they're not exactly sitting pretty themselves. They're here in Brussels to discuss skyrocketing energy costs, rising concerns about the what-next in Ukraine and the dilemma about how to handle China.
All these issues are ones on which they would like to co-operate closely with their geographical neighbour the UK, which Brussels views as sharing the same western liberal democratic values.
ke the recent meeting in Prague of all 44 European countries, bar Russia and Belarus, as a case in point.
meeting - held at a time of crisis on the European continent - was the brainchild of French President Emmanuel Macron. 
He was hellbent on getting the UK to attend. The summit wouldn't have been viewed as a success without that key continental player.
And this wasn't (just) about Macron's ego. 
He and Liz Truss had a rather rocky start to her premiership. On the campaign trail she'd laughingly stated after being asked that ""the jury was still out"" as to whether the French president was the UK's friend or foe.
But in preparations for the Prague summit he wanted to ensure the UK would go home with a full goody bag. He discussed what were described as ""ambitious"" plans with Liz Truss on how to better co-operate on stopping people smugglers operating across the Channel. 
On energy, the UK was re-integrated into the North Seas co-operation group building wind farms and energy interconnectors. And there were concrete discussions about Franco-British nuclear energy projects. There was widespread praise too from Eastern European leaders, the Dutch and others on UK leadership in providing military support for Ukraine against Russia's assault.
President Macron hoped to demonstrate that working with Europe - not necessarily inside the European Union - is a win for the UK even if, at times, politically awkward for some British politicians post-Brexit.
But now, EU leaders are wary of who might follow Liz Truss as the next UK prime minister.
Rumours that it could be Boris Johnson were privately met with some mock despair.
""Seriously? Boris?"" asked the representative of one key EU member state. ""He left in disgrace not long ago. He's not a serious international player, even if the UK is.""
Another EU diplomat questioned how Boris Johnson ""could possibly be seen as a man a Conservative government could unite behind, when his party sent him packing because his scandals were seen as spelling disaster at the polls"".
rns amongst European leaders are two-fold:
Italy has certainly bridled at the Economist magazine using the term ""Britaly"" to suggest UK politics and economics are becoming as unreliable as Italy's.
Online agenzianova.com wrote that the comparison was laughable since Italy was now in the process of forming a new government based on a decisive and recent general election, while UK politics were already unstable when the Queen passed away, and are now once again in the throes of fresh and concerning political instability."	/news/world-europe-63343754
business	Santander UK fined £108m over money laundering failings	"Santander has been fined £107.7m over ""serious and persistent gaps"" in its anti-money laundering controls which opened the door to ""financial crime"".
financial watchdog said the bank ""failed to properly oversee and manage"" systems aimed at verifying information provided by business customers.
Santander also failed to properly monitor the money customers had going through their accounts.
k said it was ""very sorry"" for the failings and had taken action. 
Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said: ""Santander's poor management of their anti-money laundering systems and their inadequate attempts to address the problems created a prolonged and severe risk of money laundering and financial crime.
failings affected the oversight of accounts held by more than 560,000 business customers between 31 December 2012 and 18 October 2017, and led to more than £298m passing through the bank before it closed accounts.
FCA said that in one case, a new customer opened an account as a small translations business with expected monthly deposits of £5,000. Within six months it was receiving millions in deposits, and swiftly transferring the money to separate accounts.
Although the account was recommended for closure by the bank's own anti-money laundering team in March 2014, the FCA said that poor processes by Santander meant that it was not acted upon until September 2015. 
As a result, the customer continued to receive and transfer millions of pounds through its account.
City watchdog identified several other business banking accounts which Santander failed to manage correctly, leaving the bank open to ""serious money laundering risk"". 
Santander chief executive Mike Regnier said: ""We are very sorry for the historical anti-money laundering related controls issues in our Business Banking division between 2012-17 highlighted in the FCA's findings.""
He said the bank took action to address the issues once they were identified, but accepted that its anti-money laundering controls at the time should have been stronger.
""We have since made significant changes to address this by overhauling our financial crime technology, systems and processes, he said, adding that more than 4,400 Santander staff are now focused on preventing financial crime.
Regulators have been busy cracking down on banks for money-laundering failures. 
ggest UK fine was for NatWest, which was penalised £265m in December 2021 after it admitted three offences of failing to comply with money laundering regulations between 2012 and 2016. It failed to prevent money-laundering of nearly £400m by a Bradford gold trading business, which in one instance deposited £700,000 in cash into a branch in black bin bags. 
HSBC was also fined in December 2021, paying £64m after the FCA found ""unacceptable failings"" in its anti-money laundering systems between 2010 to 2018. The bank had previously been fined £1.4bn for failing to prevent laundering by Mexican drug cartels after an investigation by the US Department of Justice. 
In June this year, Credit Suisse was fined for involvement in money laundering related to a Bulgarian drugs ring. It was fined around £1.7m and ordered to pay £15m to the Swiss government.

business	Digital skills shortage 'limiting growth' on IOM, says business leader	"A lack of digitally skilled workers continues to hamper growth for some Manx firms, the head of the island's Chamber of Commerce said. 
Kristan McDonald said it was impacting the Isle of Man's financial services and e-gaming sectors.
Labour market data shows the Isle of Man had low unemployment rates in 2022, with a high number of vacancies.
Mr McDonald said the island was struggling to attract those with digital skills.
Countries like Portugal were doing a ""good job"" in recruiting them by using legislation and offering incentives to live and work there, he added. 
""For a lot of people it doesn't matter where you are and what time zone you are in as long as the work gets done, so why not live somewhere that's really nice, and has a vibrant outside of work culture."" 
But the Isle of Man does not ""have a lot of that, in all honesty"", so the government must focus its efforts instead on removing barriers and creating incentives for those who want to relocate, Mr McDonald said.
Without this, firms will ""carry on establishing brass plaques here"" and employ workers elsewhere, which ""doesn't help us"", he added.
A government plan to create 5,000 new jobs on the island by 2032 includes plans to invest in developing skills through the education system.
It also includes commitments to improve infrastructure on the island to make it a more attractive relocation option.
mber of commerce still held frustrations about the responsiveness of the civil service, and its ability to collectively deal with issues like recruitment, Mr McDonald said.
, which represents hundreds of Manx business, had put proposals to retrain workers and skill people coming out of education to the government earlier this year, he added.
But after some ""really good initial engagement"" the work ""fell into a black hole"" and progress stalled, Mr McDonald said. 
And he admitted it had been a challenging year for both government and the private sector due to soaring energy costs and record inflation.

business	Diesel prices reach record of over £1.80 a litre	"UK diesel prices rose to a record of just over £1.80 a litre as efforts to stop importing fuel from Russia pushed up costs for retailers, the RAC said.
After the previous record of £1.79 was set in March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prices dipped but have risen again in recent weeks.
RAC said petrol prices went up by nearly 3p a litre since the start of May and were £1.66 a litre on average.
It said if EU members agreed to ban Russian oil, prices could rise further.
EU has been focusing for weeks on how to wean itself off Russian energy and has plans to phase out Russian crude oil over six months.
However, countries are split on how soon they wind down dependence - Hungary has rejected the proposal as unacceptable and the Czech and Slovak governments want a transition period.
UK is not as dependent on Russian oil as the EU is, however, almost a fifth of all UK diesel consumption was provided by Russian imports in 2020.
UK is also affected when global prices rise, despite its plans to stop Russian oil imports by the end of the year.
""Efforts to move away from importing Russian diesel have led to a tightening of supply and pushed up the price retailers pay for diesel,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams.
""Unfortunately, drivers with diesel vehicles need to brace themselves for yet more pain at the pumps."" 
In recent weeks, fuel sales have fallen as drivers have cut back on the number of journeys they make due to higher pump prices
Petrol station operator Ascona Group, which owns 60 UK petrol stations, said the amount of fuel it sold had dropped by 200,000 litres a week compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Managing director Darren Briggs said customers were making £20 to £30 fuel purchases ""last a little bit longer"".
Office for National Statistics revealed last week that the UK's economy shrank by 0.1% in March and said higher prices, including those at the petrol pumps, were ""really beginning to bite"".
wnturn came ahead of the impact of higher energy bills in April, which has sparked fears from analysts that the UK economy is at risk of a recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods - later this year.
Cutting diesel imports is tough
Analysis by Ben King, BBC business reporter
Cutting energy imports from Russia is a vital part of the West's plan to put the squeeze on the Putin regime and its war machine.
But when it comes to diesel, it's particularly tough - not least for the UK.
Diesel is produced by refining crude oil, and before the war, much of the UK's diesel supply was made in Russia and shipped to Britain in tankers.
Diesel supplies across the world were low before the crisis began, and the uncertainty surrounding the latest round of EU sanctions is helping to push those prices higher.
Most European countries are already reducing their imports of Russian oil and diesel - and imports from the Middle East and elsewhere are taking up some of the slack. But securing those extra supplies means paying higher prices. 
figures from the data firm Vortexa showed that just over half Europe's diesel imports were still coming from Russia. 
And the Asian head of the major oil trading firm Vitol, Mike Muller, warned earlier this month that EU rules which came into force on Sunday could make trading with Russia even harder, for instance by making it impossible to pay Russian suppliers.
's not likely to mean pumps running dry in the UK, says analyst Neil Crosby, who follows the diesel market for OilX.
""The UK itself may manage more or less to get by, but retail prices are not liable to cool any time soon,"" he said.  
In a bid to curb rising fuel prices, Chancellor Rishi Sunak cut the fuel duty by 5p a litre after previous record prices were seen in March.
RAC said then the cut was ""a drop in the ocean"" and now claimed drivers would be better off if had Mr Sunak reduced VAT on fuel.
""Had Mr Sunak reduced VAT to 15% as we called on him to do instead of cutting duty by 5p, drivers of diesel vehicles would be around 2p a litre better off, or £1 for every full tank,"" Mr Williams said.
""As it is, drivers are still paying 27p VAT on petrol and 29p on diesel, which is just the same as before the Spring Statement.""
reasury said it had introduced the ""biggest ever cut to all fuel duty rates - worth £5bn when taken together with the fuel duty freeze"".
""It will save the average UK car driver around £100, van driver around £200 and haulier over £1,500, based on average fuel consumption,"" a statement said.
government said businesses in general pay VAT on their sales but recover the tax on their purchases, meaning many can reclaim any VAT incurred when buying fuel.
rice of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - has soared in recent months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised concerns of potential global supply issues.
Ahead of the invasion, fuel prices had already been rising after demand increased following the reopening of economies from coronavirus lockdowns."	/news/business-61463280

health	Health bosses urge strike deal as talks take place	"A deal must be found to end the NHS strikes ahead of the ""winter onslaught"", health managers say.
NHS Providers interim chief executive Saffron Cordery said the ""last thing"" the NHS needed was prolonged industrial action as winter hits.
She said there was no doubt patients would lose out, with longer waits for hospital treatment.
It comes as unions in England met ministers on Tuesday after Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members voted to strike.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay met RCN leaders along with representatives of the other major NHS unions, including Unison, GMB and Unite, which are all balloting over industrial action.
uld lead to paramedics, health care assistants, porters and cleaners joining nurses in taking strike action. 
While emergency care will be protected during the RCN strike, Ms Cordery said there was ""no doubt"" patients would still be affected.
major fear is that the waiting list for planned treatment will grow even more - there are already more than seven million people in England waiting for treatment; a record high.
Ms Cordery said: ""We understand the frustration felt by nurses following years of below-inflation pay settlements, the rising cost of living, and working through a pandemic, and we strongly urge both sides in these talks to find a deal that recognises their hard work and skills.
""The last thing the health service needs right now is prolonged industrial action. It's good to see dialogue taking place.""
meeting comes after Mr Barclay briefly met RCN general secretary Patricia Cullen last week following the announcement that the union's members had voted for strikes in more than half the hospitals, mental health and community services in England. The strike action will also affect Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

meeting on Tuesday does not represent the restarting of formal pay talks, but is the first time the two sides have met since early summer.
Unions welcomed the talks. But Unison head of health Sara Gorton, who is the lead negotiator for all the NHS unions, said: ""There can be no. solution unless the government improves pay.""
After the meeting, Mr Barclay committed to keeping the dialogue with unions going.
""My door remains open and we will continue to meet,"" he added.
At the weekend, Mr Barclay, writing in the Sunday Telegraph, had warned that the RCN's demands for a 17% pay rise were simply unaffordable and would only make inflation worse. 
government in England has given NHS staff, including nurses, an average of 4.75%, which is in line with what was recommended by the independent NHS Pay Review Body.
government has pointed out that this came after a 3% pay increase last year - at a time when the rest of the public sector had a pay freeze - in recognition of the work done during the pandemic.
Ms Cordery's plea on strikes comes as NHS Providers hosts its annual conference of NHS leaders in Liverpool on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Feedback from its members showed many were reporting they were more concerned about this winter than any previous ones during their careers. 
Some are fearing an ""onslaught"" in the coming months, as ongoing pressures from Covid and the threat of strikes and the cost-of-living crisis combine with the normal winter pressures.

politics	Sir Gavin Williamson 'has not apologised' to Wendy Morton, friends say	"Ex-Chief Whip Wendy Morton has not yet received an apology or any contact from Gavin Williamson, friends of Ms Morton have told the BBC. 
Ms Morton complained to the Conservative Party on 24 October about Sir Gavin after he sent her a series of expletive-laden messages. 
Rishi Sunak has said the language was ""not acceptable"", but No 10 insisted he still has confidence in the minister.  
BBC has contacted Sir Gavin for a comment. 
In a statement given to the Sunday Times, which published a series of WhatsApp messages, Sir Gavin said: ""I of course regret getting frustrated about the way colleagues and I felt we were being treated.""
Conservative Party has not confirmed if it will launch a formal investigation into Sir Gavin, two weeks after Ms Morton made her complaint. 
Neither MP has been informed of an inquiry, as would be expected under the party process.
Under that process, evidence is examined before a decision is made on whether a formal investigation should take place.
It has emerged Ms Morton handed the WhatsApp messages to the Conservative Party on 26 October - two days after she made her complaint.
Watch: Sunak on Williamson texts - Not right, not acceptable
In the messages, Sir Gavin is reported to have complained to Ms Morton, who was chief whip at the time, that MPs who had not supported then-PM Liz Truss were being excluded from the Queen's funeral service at Westminster Abbey.
Sir Gavin is said to have warned Ms Morton ""not to push him about"" and that ""there is a price for everything"".
Asked in Egypt, where he is attending the COP27 climate summit, if the texts amounted to bullying, Mr Sunak said an independent complaints process was under way and it would be ""right to let that process conclude"". 
He said he been clear the language used was not right and not acceptable. 
Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said the messages were sent ""in the heat of the moment at a very difficult time"".
He said Sir Gavin was ""frustrated"" with the then-government but accepted he ""shouldn't have sent [the texts] and he regrets it"".
Ex-Conservative Party Chair Jake Berry has said he told Mr Sunak about Ms Morton's complaint accusing Sir Gavin of ""bullying and intimidation"" on 24 October. 
Mr Sunak, who replaced Liz Truss as prime minister on 25 October, subsequently appointed Sir Gavin as a Cabinet Office minister. 
rime minister's spokesman told reporters that Mr Sunak ""knew there was a disagreement"" but he didn't know ""the substance"" of messages until they were published in the Sunday Times.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Sir Gavin was ""clearly not suitable"" to be a minister and that his appointment was a sign of ""weakness"" by Mr Sunak. 
Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, told Times Radio he would sack one of his frontbenchers in Holyrood, if they had written messages similar to those sent by Sir Gavin. "	/news/uk-politics-63545502
health	'Not enough' done to help early development - Kate	"""Not enough is being done"" to support the early development of children and nurture their potential, the Princess of Wales has said. 
Catherine wrote in the Daily Telegraph that she wants to use her position to ""shine a light on this issue"".
By focusing on the first five years, a ""healthier and happier society for future generations"" could be created.
mother-of-three has long been a champion of early years development and the importance these years play.
""It is the way we develop through our experiences, relationships and interactions at that very young age that shapes everything from our ability to form relationships and succeed at work, to our mental and physical health as adults,"" she wrote.
""There are fantastic examples of what can be achieved when we recognise the unique potential of early childhood and build a safe and loving world around a child.""
She said that the years from pregnancy to the age of five influence people's lives and are when the core foundations which allow them to thrive as adults are built.
Catherine added that it is now understood that the human brain develops faster in the first five years than at any other time, meaning those years are ""hugely significant"". 
""But not enough is being done. If we are going to tackle the sorts of complex challenges we face today like homelessness, violence and addiction, which are so often underpinned by poverty and poor mental health, we have to fully appreciate those most preventative years and do everything we can to nurture our children and those who care for them,"" she added.
""We have an incredible opportunity, armed with all we now know as a result of the work of dedicated scientists, researchers and practitioners, to make a huge difference to the mental and physical health of generations to come.
""That is why I am determined to continue to shine a light on this issue and to do everything I can to secure much greater focus on those first crucial few years for the youngest members of our society - they are, after all, our future.""
Last year, Catherine launched her own Centre for Early Childhood to raise awareness of the importance of early years.
At the time, a royal aide said Catherine felt early childhood was the ""social equivalent to climate change"" but that it was not discussed with the same seriousness."	/news/uk-63765377

business	Ukraine war: Global wheat prices jump after India export ban	"rice of wheat has jumped on international markets after India banned the export of the staple cereal.
mark wheat index rose as much as 5.9% in Chicago, the highest it has been in two months.
xport ban comes after a heatwave hit India's wheat crops, taking domestic prices to a record high.
f everything from bread and cakes to noodles and pasta has risen in recent months as wheat prices soared on world commodity markets.
India's government said it would still allow exports backed by letters of credit that have already been issued, and to countries that request supplies ""to meet their food security needs"".
Government officials also said the ban was not permanent and could be revised.
Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries
However, the decision has been criticised by agriculture ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations meeting in Germany.
""If everyone starts to impose export restrictions or to close markets, that would worsen the crisis,"" German food and agriculture minister Cem Ozdemir said.
G7 is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States.
Although India is the world's second-biggest wheat producer, it has not previously been a major exporter as most of its crop is sold on domestic markets. 
But Ukraine's wheat exports plunged after the Russian invasion. And with droughts and floods threatening crops in other major producers, commodity traders were expecting supplies from India to make up for part of the shortfall.
Before the ban, India had aimed to ship a record 10 million tonnes of wheat this year.
Vikas Pandey, India editor, BBC News
Just a week ago, senior officials from India's commerce ministry told me that they were bullish about increasing the country's wheat exports to meet the surge in global demand. They echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that ""India was ready to feed the world"".
So, the ban does seem like a major policy U-turn. It also hints at the government's concerns over rising prices at home. But the decision could cause what one expert described as a foreign policy challenge for India.
Delhi had been making noises to get a waiver from a World Trade Organization rule that makes it difficult for countries to export grains that - as the Indian government routinely does - are bought at a fixed price from farmers for official reserves. And some countries seemed willing to help India find a way to export wheat to the world.

health	Coronavirus: China's hospitals seem to be filling up - WHO	"Hospitals in China appear to be filling up amid concerns about a fresh Covid-19 wave hitting the country, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.
Dr Michael Ryan says intensive care units (ICU) are busy despite officials saying numbers are ""relatively low"".
China figures show no-one died of Covid on Wednesday but there is scepticism about the disease's real impact. 
In recent days hospitals in Beijing and other cities have been filling up as the latest Covid surge hits China.
Since 2020, China has imposed strict health restrictions as part of its zero Covid policy. 
But, the government ended most of those measures two weeks ago after landmark protests against the strict controls.
umber of cases has since soared, raising fears of a high mortality rate among the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable.
Despite the rise, the official figures show only five people died from Covid on Tuesday and two on Monday.
It has led to WHO emergencies chief Dr Ryan urging China to provide more information about the latest spread of the virus.
He said: ""In China, what's been reported is relatively low numbers of cases in ICUs, but anecdotally ICUs are filling up.
""We've been saying this for weeks that this highly infectious virus was always going to be very hard to stop completely, with just public health and social measures.""
Speaking during a weekly news conference in Geneva WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he is ""very concerned over the evolving situation in China"".
He appealed for specific data on disease severity, hospital admissions and intensive care requirements.
Dr Ryan added that ""vaccination is the exit strategy"" to coronavirus outbreaks.
China has developed and produced its own vaccines, which have been shown to be less effective at protecting people against serious Covid illness and death than the mRNA vaccines used in much of the rest of the world.
His comments come as the German government announced on Wednesday it had sent its first batch of BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines to China.
German vaccines are to be administered initially to expats in China - estimated to be about 20,000.
It is the first foreign Covid-19 vaccine to be delivered to China, although no details have been released about the time or the size of the delivery.
Last month during a visit to Beijing, Chancellor Olaf Scholz pressed for the vaccine to be made freely available to Chinese citizens as well."	/news/world-asia-china-64056549

Becoming European champions on home soil, qualifying for the 2023 World Cup with a 100% record, beating the world number one at Wembley and going an entire year unbeaten.
""You can't beat that, you can only equal that,"" said England manager Sarina Wiegman as she reflected on a memorable spell.
England's success has coincided with Wiegman's arrival and they are unbeaten after 26 games under the Dutchwoman since her appointment in September 2021.
ready broken records, created history and perhaps changed the women's game forever. 
So what next as they prepare for a World Cup in 2023? 
""Of course we want to break all the records, but breaking records doesn't [give you what you need]. We always bring it back to what we have to take action in,"" added Wiegman. 
""How do we stick together as a team? I truly believe that's where it starts. The players feel very comfortable with that way of approach. 
""At the moment it works really well and they feel really comfortable. You can tell because we are enjoying ourselves - and winning helps.""
Few could have imagined 2022 going so well for the Lionesses. Wiegman took over after England had won just four of 14 matches and the Great Britain squad lost in the quarter-finals of the Olympic Games.
July's Euro 2022 victory was undisputedly the highlight of the year and Wiegman revealed players gave their match worn shirts to members of the staff to keep as memorabilia.
""I still have my navy suit but it's not a collector's item - I'm not very sensitive to those things. Of course it will stick forever with me,"" she said.
""I think if I would have worn a shirt as a player, I would absolutely keep it. Beth Mead gave me her shirt so I'm really happy to have one. That's a very good present for us.""
final was watched by 87,192 people at Wembley - a record for a Euros game in men's or women's football.
Queen Elizabeth II led tributes to the Lionesses afterwards and thousands gathered in Trafalgar Square the following morning to celebrate.
Faces of the Lionesses were on the front and back pages of every national newspaper, while murals were painted across the country in various cities. 
rs' lives have changed - so how does Wiegman manage that as they prepare to continue their unbeaten run and win the World Cup next summer when it is held in Australia and New Zealand?
""There is pressure, we know,"" she added. ""We know that when you win, the pressure will be higher and higher - that's just the way it works. The concern is that the players' lives have changed a little bit.
""Some players really adapted to the situation already, some players need a little bit of support. There are a lot of things outside of football that are related to football that are asked of players now.
""It's finding the balance and not getting overwhelmed. That takes time. Some players are really young. Within six weeks they became famous English people. Everyone wants something from them. 
""Your brains have to get used to your new life. It brings lots of good things but also some sacrifices. Some players can't walk down the street anymore without being [mobbed by fans].""
After a perfect 2022, England's task arguably gets harder next year.
re is more expectation, more pressure and greater competition - back-to-back world champions the United States and Olympic champions Canada are among those who will feature at the World Cup.
Having not lost a game yet under Wiegman and, after beating the USA at Wembley in October, is there still room for improvement?
""Yes absolutely, I think we have to get better. The game develops so quickly,"" said Wiegman.
""Next year [at the World Cup], because of the amount of countries that join in the group stage, I think the beginning will be a little bit different [to Euro 2022]. 
""When you get further in the tournament, the level is going to be so high. Different styles of play, different coaches - which is exciting and challenging.
""But we have to take our game to the next stage to make the chance of being successful as high as possible.
""There are more things we want to do to be more unpredictable and add to our game. I'm not going to share all of it!"""	/sport/football/64008815
technology	Is this really the end of Twitter?	"witter today is awash with people saying goodbye. 
g ""RIPTwitter"" is trending and lots of the site's users are scrambling to download their data.
're also sharing alternative places to find them (consumer champion Martin Lewis, who has two million Twitter followers, has set himself up on Mastodon, although he admits he doesn't know how to use it yet).
witter's new boss Elon Musk, never one to ignore a trend, tweeted a meme of a gravestone with the Twitter logo on it. 
Staff have been leaving in their droves - half the workforce was laid off by Mr Musk one week after he completed his purchase of the platform, and many more are choosing to leave since he sent an email demanding ""hardcore"" working conditions and long hours from his remaining employees. 
Quite a few of those departing, according to their Twitter bios, are engineers, developers and coders - the people who work on the guts of what makes Twitter function.
Let's take the two biggest vulnerabilities that could knock the blue bird off its perch very swiftly.
first and most obvious would be a catastrophic hack. 
witter, like all big websites (including this one, the BBC), will be constantly under attack from bad actors - even at state level - wanting to cause mischief. World leaders, politicians and celebrities all have personal Twitter accounts with millions of followers - a low-hanging fruit for a hacker wanting a lot of people to see their scam, as we have seen before. 
Or they might just want it to disappear, so they bombard it with web traffic to see if it gets overwhelmed and shuts down that way. Attempts like this will be happening all the time - it's a constant battle.
Cyber-security is, or at least should be, an important part of any 21st Century company's day-to-day operations. Last week Twitter's head of cyber-security, Lea Kissner, left the company. It's not known if she was replaced. (Twitter also has no communications team, so there's no easy way to ask.) 
witter's security is likely to be pretty robust. You can't run a site used by 300 million people every month that's held together with a bit of string. But that robustness requires continuing maintenance. 
k about your own phone, or laptop, and the regular security updates you have to install. That's because new vulnerabilities are regularly unearthed, new chinks in the armour that you didn't know you had, and it's the job of the provider to send you the fix.
r is that the servers are knocked out - either by someone with a grudge, or by mistake during a routine bit of maintenance that's not properly supervised. 
Without servers, there is no Twitter (or Facebook, or Instagram or indeed our digital world.) 
Servers - powerful computers -  are like the physical bodies of these platforms. They exist in data centres. These are effectively warehouses full of computer servers which are central to the operations of online businesses. The world runs on servers.
As you can imagine, all of those machines generate a lot of heat. Data centres have to be kept cool, and they require a constant source of electricity.
rvers themselves also require maintenance and replacement, as data gets migrated between them. All of that has the capacity for something to go wrong. It would be sudden and dramatic if it did.
Elon Musk knows all this, of course. Let's not assume that he doesn't. However he may choose to play the buffoon.
We don't know who is currently keeping watch. 
But something happened to me yesterday that made me think perhaps there are more people at Twitter watching than we think.
I told the story about an astronomer who was locked out of her account after wrongly falling foul of automated moderation tools. Nobody at Twitter or Mr Musk's other firms responded to me, or made contact with her. But her account was indeed restored later that day. 
Somebody, somewhere inside Twitter, was paying attention. Perhaps there are still enough of them who are doing just that. 
re is of course a third option - the nuclear one - which is that Musk declares Twitter bankrupt, and it gets wound down. Although right now he seems to be enjoying his status as Chief Twit.

technology	Ukraine war: Drone attack on Russian bomber base leaves three dead	"A Ukrainian drone attack on an airbase for bombers in southern Russia has left three people dead, Moscow says. 
Air defences shot down the drone near the Engels base, but falling debris fatally wounded three technical staff, the defence ministry said.
Earlier this month, Russia accused Ukraine of a similar attack on the airfield, home to bombers that have carried out missile attacks on Ukraine. 
ut 650km (400 miles) north-east of Ukraine's border.
Ukrainian military did not officially admit to the latest attack, but air force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat said the explosions were the result of what Russia was doing on Ukrainian soil.
Hours afterwards Russia's FSB security service announced it had killed a four-strong ""sabotage group"" trying to enter the Russian border region of Bryansk from Ukraine armed with improvised explosive devices and German-made submachine guns. The FSB released video of what it said was the ""liquidation"" of the group, although there is no independent confirmation of the incident.
rone attack inside Russia will come as an embarrassment to Russian authorities, coming so soon after the two 5 December attacks hundreds of kilometres from the front line - both at the Engels base and in the Ryazan region. At the time Russia also blamed falling debris for the deaths of three servicemen and what it described as light damage to two aircraft.
Social media early on Monday posted videos of blasts and air sirens in the vicinity of Engels airfield.
Russia's defence ministry said later that its air defences had shot down the drone flying at low altitude at about 01:35 on Monday (22:35 GMT Sunday).
Saratov governor Roman Busargin expressed his condolences to the men's families and friends, and said there was ""absolutely no threat to residents"" in the town of Engels itself.
Ukrainian air force spokesman said satellite imagery of the airfield would soon reveal the full damage from Monday's attack, adding that earlier blasts had damaged aircraft at the base.
Engels air base has been repeatedly used by Russia to carry out missile strikes on various targets in Ukraine since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February.
Kremlin has accused Ukraine of attacking its territory before, but the latest incidents have taken place far deeper in Russian territory.
After the 5 December attacks, there were widespread calls for tightened security around Russian military installations and the latest attack suggests that has not happened. 
Separately on Monday, Ukraine's foreign ministry demanded Russia's removal as one of five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and called for its exclusion from the UN ""as a whole"". 
re is currently no clear mechanism to replace a permanent Security Council member.
However, Ukraine argues that Russia illegally took over the old USSR seat when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. Ukraine accuses Russia of abusing the veto power given to each council member, citing examples of Moscow blocking resolutions on the Syria war and the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine.

business	Train strikes: Drivers to walk out over pay on 13 August	"rain drivers at nine rail companies will strike on 13 August in a dispute over pay, the union Aslef has said.
Aslef members at seven companies were already set to walk out on 30 July and drivers at two more firms have now voted for industrial action, the union said. 
It said strikes were a ""last resort"" but the rising cost of living meant workers had faced a real terms pay cut.
Passengers have faced disruption on Wednesday due to another rail strike. 
Around 40,000 RMT union members at Network Rail and 14 other train companies walked out over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions. 
It meant only one in five services were expected to run, with some places including Blackpool, Portsmouth and Bournemouth having no trains at all. 
Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has sacked his junior shadow transport minister for making an unauthorised media appearance, after he joined striking rail workers on a picket line on Wednesday. 
Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said the union did not want to inconvenience passengers ""but we've been forced into this position by the companies, who say they have been driven to this by the Tory government"". 
""With inflation running at north of 10% that means those drivers have had a real terms pay cut over the last three years,"" he said.
""We want an increase in line with the cost of living - we want to be able to buy, in 2022, what we could buy in 2021.""
However, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said Aslef's announcement showed a ""cynical approach to talks, a total disregard for passengers and is putting everyone's summer plans at risk"".
""This action will bring the total number of strike days on the railway to ten, disrupting plans in June, July and August,"" a statement said.
""Like any public service we have to change with the times. Now is not the time for further strikes, so we urge the Aslef leadership to resume talks to reach a deal that is fair to staff and taxpayers.""
Department for Transport said train drivers were earning just under £60,000 per year, ""more than twice the UK average and significantly more than the very workers who will be most impacted by these strikes"". 
""It's incredibly disappointing Aslef bosses have announced more destructive strike action, particularly when it has become clear they have no interest in holding constructive talks with the industry,"" a statement said.
government urged union bosses to reconsider.
Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, is currently at its highest level for 40 years, which has prompted many workers and unions to call for pay rises. 
Several rail strikes have already gone ahead this summer and there are more planned, with unions including Aslef and the RMT rejecting deals from train companies and Network Rail.
rain drivers at nine rail companies will strike on 13 August: 
Further ballots close at Chiltern Railways, Northern Trains and TransPennine on 25 August and at East Midlands Railway on 19 September.
Network Rail, which owns and manages the country's railway infrastructure, said disruption and delays to train journeys would continue into Thursday morning as RMT members return to their duties after Wednesday's strike.
ue to the knock-on impact of industrial action on shift patterns as staff who would usually clock on in the early hours of the morning will start work later on Thursday. It is hoped any disruption will have eased by mid-morning.
Network Rail has advised passengers to check services before travelling.
During Wednesday's strike, Network Rail said passenger numbers at the major railway stations it manages were down by about 65 to 70% compared to a usual Wednesday, but up roughly 15%, compared to the last strike day in June.
rike action has disrupted people's plans to see the second Women's Euro 2022 semi-final between Germany and France in Milton Keynes. 
It has also affected travel to Birmingham, where the Commonwealth Games begin on Thursday. 
Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said despite its best efforts to agree a deal with the RMT, there would be more rail disruption due to strikes. He called the action ""pointless"".
Network Rail has offered RMT members a pay rise of 4%, plus further increases in the second year of its proposals, but the union has described it as ""paltry sum"", with inflation at 9.4% and forecast to go higher.
RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said there remained a ""huge chasm"" between the union, train companies and Network Rail around pay, job security and working conditions.
But the RMT has also accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of not allowing the rail industry to do a deal with the union.
However, the Department for Transport said the RMT has been ""hell-bent on creating further misery for passengers across the UK"".
Besides pay, the RMT is against Network Rail plans to cut 2,500 maintenance jobs, as the company tries to save £2bn over the next two years.
Network Rail says there would be no more than 2,000 job losses, and that all redundancies can be voluntary, but the RMT insists those jobs are safety-critical and the cuts would mean losing a third of front-line maintenance roles."	/news/business-62325025
business	Jim Ratcliffe: Who is the potential Man Utd bidder?	"One of the UK's richest men, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has built a multi-billion pound business by buying unloved assets. Now he wants to buy Manchester United.
News of the Ineos founder's interest followed a Bloomberg report in August that the Glazer family - United's current owners - were willing to sell a minority stake in the club.
Now the Glazers have confirmed they are considering selling the club as they ""explore strategic alternatives"".
United, 20-time English champions, are fifth in the Premier League under new manager Erik ten Hag, with the season currently on a break for the World Cup in Qatar.
Glazers have been criticised for their perceived lack of investment in the club, which has struggled since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 and has not won a trophy since 2017.
Born the son of a joiner in Failsworth, in Greater Manchester, Sir Jim is a boyhood fan of United.
""If the club is for sale, Jim is definitely a potential buyer,"" the 69-year-old's spokesperson told The Times in August.
""If something like this was possible, we would be interested in talking with a view to long-term ownership.""
In many ways it is a familiar modus operandi for the man once called Dr No by trade unions for his tough negotiating stance.
rough buying up and turning around cast-off parts of other businesses, Sir Jim has built up a huge fortune - although estimates of his wealth vary.
Forbes puts it at just under £11bn, whereas The Sunday Times Rich List, which lists him as the 27th wealthiest person in the UK, says it's closer to £6bn.
From operations once owned by the likes of oil giant BP, Sir Jim created a company - Ineos - whose chemicals and raw materials go into nearly everything we touch every day. 
From 194 sites across 29 countries, Ineos generates sales of around £50bn and employs more than 26,000 people. 
Its raw materials are used in everything from packaging for toiletries, medicines and food, to mobile phones and furniture.
Sir Jim has always been involved with chemicals and industry.
After graduating with a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Birmingham in 1974, he spent several years at oil firms BP and Esso before joining the fabric and chemicals producer Courtaulds.
, in 1989, he made a career-changing step into the world of private equity when he joined Advent International.
It taught Sir Jim the cut and thrust of doing deals, before he made the leap into co-owning a business himself based on what would become a well-worn strategy. 
He and fellow businessman John Hollowood bought BP's chemicals division in Hythe near Southampton for £40m in 1992. By 1994, it was valued at £100m when it floated on the London Stock Exchange.
usiness, called Inspec, went on to acquire BP's speciality chemicals business in Antwerp, Belgium. Sir Jim then left to form his own firm, Ineos, in 1998 which bought the Belgian business for £89m. 
Ineos has since grown to become a chemical powerhouse, expanding through acquisitions or by investing in controversial areas such as fracking.
Because of his decision never to float the company and thus have no City shareholders to consult, Sir Jim - who is also the majority shareholder of Ineos - has been able to move quickly on deals.
He has also earned a reputation as a tough negotiator in industrial disputes. 
Famously he faced off against unions at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant and refinery in Scotland in 2013, amid the threat of company-wide strikes over pay and pensions. 
ute - which earned Sir Jim the Bond villain moniker of Dr No - led to Ineos announcing that it would close the plant and cut 800 jobs.
However, the firm reversed its decision shortly afterwards when the Unite union agreed to a survival plan to invest £300m in the site to keep it open.
No stranger to controversy, Sir Jim attracted criticism when in 2016 Ineos imported the first ever shipment of shale gas (derived from fracking) from the US into the UK amid fierce opposition from green groups. 
He also reportedly moved from the UK to Monaco in 2020, a place that does not collect personal income tax or capital gains taxes. Sir Jim declined to comment but when asked about reports he was moving to the principality in 2019 he told the BBC that he tried to ""give back to the UK"" and had invested £2.5bn in the country.
In recent years Sir Jim's business interests have moved away from chemicals. He announced plans to build a new vehicle based on the Land Rover Defender, which was discontinued in 2016.
However, in 2020, Sir Jim, who was a Leave campaigner in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, said the new 4x4 vehicle would be built in France, ending hopes it would be made at a new plant in Wales.
In 2017, Ineos bought Belstaff, the luxury motorcycle wear maker whose jackets were once worn by actor Steve McQueen and modelled by the likes of David Beckham. Ineos also has a partnership with the Mercedes F1 team.
And in 2019, Sir Jim became the new owner of a high-profile professional cycling team, after Ineos took over the former Team Sky. The team is now called Ineos Grenadiers.
Whether or not these businesses could be classed as unloved is not certain, but Sir Jim clearly saw plenty of potential in them.
Sir Jim already has some footballing interests, as he owns French side Nice and Swiss club Lausanne-Sport.
In May, Sir Jim made an unsuccessful £4.25bn offer to buy Chelsea after owner Roman Abramovich put the London club up for sale.
At the time, he told BBC Sport he was a Manchester United fan and the reason he was not bidding for the Red Devils was because they were not for sale.

technology	Google loses appeal over record EU anti-trust Android fine	"An EU court has largely upheld a record fine against Google for using the Android platform to cement its search engine's dominance.
€4.125bn (£3.5bn) penalty is the largest anti-trust fine ever handed down by the European Commission.
It said Google had breached its laws by forcing Android phone-makers to carry its search and web browser apps in order to access the Google Play Store in 2018.
Google has since changed its terms.
firm said it was ""disappointed"" by the verdict.
""Android has created more choice for everyone, not less, and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world,"" Google said in a statement.
Google acquired the mobile phone operating system developer, which today powers roughly 70% of the world's mobile phones, in 2005 for $50m (£43m).
European General Court reduced the European Commission's original fine slightly in Wednesday's final ruling on Google's appeal. It said this was to reflect ""the gravity and the duration"" of the infringement.
""The General Court largely confirms the Commission's decision that Google imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices and mobile network in order to consolidate the dominant position of its search engine,"" it said.
A European Commission spokesperson said it will ""carefully study the judgement and decide on possible next steps"".
European Consumer Organisation, which represents a network of consumer groups across the EU, welcomed the ruling.
Monique Goyens, its director general, said the ruling ""confirms that Europe's consumers must enjoy meaningful choice between search engines and browsers on their phones and tablets"". 
She said Google had deprived consumers of ""genuine choice"" over which search engines to use. 
""If they preferred, for example, to use more innovative and privacy-friendly services, Google's restrictions prevented them from doing so.""
urt's ruling shores up the European Commission's efforts to clamp down on Big Tech, after anti-trust fines against Intel and Qualcomm were quashed by the European General Court earlier this year.
Google says it was acting like any other business when it told other manufacturers using Android that in order to include the Play Store on their smartphones and tablets, they also had to pre-install Google's own search and web apps.
Without that store, the devices would have had limited access to other apps, making them a lot less desirable to buy. The EU says this was unlawful.
ragged on for four years now, but Google did change its terms after the original ruling, in 2018. The European court lowered the fine slightly to reflect this - but it's still the largest anti-trust penalty it has ever given out.
Google says Android offers more choice, not less, and that anyone is free to change their search and web browser apps - but the reality is that most people never stray from the option that came with their phone.
A number of different manufacturers use Android as the operating system for their devices.
Google's version of Android does not prevent device owners downloading alternative web browsers or using other search engines.
But at the time of the original 2018 judgement the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said that only 1% of users downloaded a rival search app, and 10% a different browser.
Google rejected the accusation.
""Rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition and Android has enabled all of them,"" chief executive Sundar Pichai blogged.
In that original ruling, the EU commission said that Google had abused its ""dominant position"" by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on manufacturers because:
Google was required to ""stop and to not re-engage in any of the three types of practices"" or do anything else that might have the same effect.
In denying Google's appeal, the court agreed with all but the last of these findings - concerning payments to manufacturers - which it annulled.
European Commission first began scrutinising Android in April 2015, after a complaint by FairSearch - a lobby group that originally included Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle among its members.
Clifford Chance, a law firm representing FairSearch, said the latest judgment was a ""vindication"" of its client's complaint.  
A partner of the firm, Dieter Paemen, said in a statement: ""The annulment of one of the infringements found and the reduction of the fine won't lighten up the mood in Mountain View - that's just a drop in the bucket for Google.
""This is a positive outcome for consumers who stand a better chance of real choices on their mobile devices.""
Now, Mr Paemen said, the Commission must turn to seriously enforcing the ""remedies"" in the decision. "	/news/technology-62888137
health	Matt Hancock: I was warned 820,000 in UK could die from Covid	"Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he was warned 820,000 people in the UK could die from Covid two months before the country went into lockdown.
In his new diaries on the pandemic, the MP says in January 2020 he was told by England's chief medical officer the toll was ""a reasonable case scenario""  if restrictions were not introduced.
Figures show more than 200,000 people with Covid have died in the UK to date.
government has set up an inquiry into its handling of the pandemic.
In his new book, Mr Hancock says that when he mentioned the projected death toll to other cabinet ministers, their reaction was ""somewhat 'shrug shrug' - essentially because they didn't really believe it"".
He wrote: ""I am constantly feeling that others, who aren't focused on this every day, are weeks behind what's going on.""
He said that 11 days later, England's chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty also warned transmission would be so high that ""almost everyone would catch it"".
Mr Hancock wrote: ""In his characteristically understated way, sitting at the back peeling a tangerine, Chris Whitty quietly informed everyone that in the reasonable worst-case scenario as many as 820,000 people in the UK may die.... The whole room froze. We are looking at a human catastrophe on a scale not seen here for a century.""
Mr Hancock's Pandemic Diaries: The Inside Story Of Britain's Battle Against Covid, is being serialised in the Daily Mail, with the West Suffolk MP set to donate all proceeds to NHS charities and causes supporting dyslexia.

Mr Hancock was criticised by MPs for his three-week stint in the jungle, where he placed third. 
He was suspended from the parliamentary Conservative Party after joining the show, and now sits as an independent MP.
In the book, the former health secretary also defended his handling of one of the most controversial episodes of the pandemic - the decision to release care home residents from hospital without testing, which was blamed for thousands of deaths.

When she woke up the following morning at home in London, Mrs Eyres says her muscles had the level of soreness that she typically got from working out for a few hours, yet she had only exercised for 20 minutes.
EMS has long been used by doctors to help improve the mobility of people with a number of health conditions, such as patients recovering from a stroke, or people with multiple sclerosis.
Using low currents of electricity to stimulate muscles and nerves, it is also often used by mothers during childbirth, in the form of a piece of equipment called a tens machine, to try to alleviate the pain. This sees the woman fix sticky pads to her lower back, and then use a hand-held controller to adjust the level of electrical charge that the pads emit. 
While those health usages typically focus on one area of the body, whole-body EMS suits (which typically comprise a short-sleeved top and shorts) are now a fast-growing trend in the fitness and gym world.
rical stimulation of your muscles speeds up the effect of exercising and strengthening. So you can do a 20-minute workout that is equivalent to one lasting 90 minutes if you weren't wearing the body suit.
While this might sound fanciful to many of us, the number of gyms offering EMS has been increasing quickly. One such provider, US chain Iron BodyFit, is continuing to expand in Europe after opening more than 100 studios in France over the past five years.
It launched its first UK venue in London last year, and plans a dozen more over the next 12 months. Other chains that focus on EMS, and are expanding in the UK, include Feel Electric and Surge.
Such growth is helping to drive the overall global market for EMS, which one report says will grow by 51% from $122m in 2020 to $184m in 2030.
But does EMS actually work in the fitness sphere? Does it really improve the efficiency of your workout and give you bigger muscles for less effort? And more importantly - is it always safe?
""We are bypassing the brain,"" says Phil Horton, UK director for German firm Miha Bodytec, one of the largest manufacturers of EMS body suits. ""We can trigger the muscle in a smarter and more efficient way compared to the way the brain would tell the muscle to move.""
He adds that the small electrical charge more easily reaches deep muscle tissue. Water is often sprayed on the suit to boost conductivity.
roblem for the EMS fitness sector is that studies into whether it works are very mixed, and even those that are positive use a lot of words like ""might"", ""could"", or ""may"".
One report back in 2011 said that the use of EMS ""has been acknowledged"" to help lead to ""significant improvements in strength"". Yet it then immediately added that such changes are ""still ambiguous"", ""poorly understood"" and ""require more study"".
An article earlier this year concluded that the jury was still very much out.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Meanwhile, the US Food & Drug Administration, which regulates EMS machines, says that when used for fitness they ""may be able to temporarily strengthen, tone or firm a muscle"", but only if accompanied by exercise and dieting.
It also cautions against the use of unregulated devices, as these may cause ""shocks, burns, bruising, skin irritation, and pain"".
Nicola Maffiuletti, a sports science expert at Swiss orthopaedic clinic Schulthess Klinik, has also long been critical of whole-body EMS.
""In particular, whole-body electrical stimulation is extremely difficult to dose properly,"" he says, adding that under-dosage means no effect, while over-dosage could cause muscle damage.
""So if we objectively look at the harmful versus beneficial effects of whole-body electrical stimulation, there are no strong arguments in favour of its use.""
Veteran US weightlifter Robert Herbst's opposition to whole-body EMS is more straightforward. The 64-year-old thinks it simply does not work.
""The stress put on your muscles by EMS is insufficient to create the micro-trauma weightlifting creates,"" says Mr Herbst, who has won several world and American championships, and still competes.
Yet US exercise physiologist Tom Holland says full-body EMS is useful because it can encourage people to do more exercise.  ""Squats, lunges, crunches, bicep curls and other traditional exercises are more fun when done through EMS,"" he says.
However, he says it is often not cheap, with prices in the US as high as $125 (£110), and those in the UK reaching as much as £130 per 20-minute session.
Back in London, Ms Eyres used whole-body EMS to help her train for rowing across the Atlantic in the 2021 Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge. She successfully completed the event, rowing in a boat with three friends.
She says that thanks in part to the use of EMS ""my abs are much better now than when I was 21"". 
""Everyone complimented me on my much stronger and toned figure."""	/news/business-62887379
technology	Nintendo lands Call of Duty in 10-year Microsoft deal	"Microsoft has entered into a 10-year agreement to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo consoles, following its plan to acquire the game's publisher.
Microsoft wants to buy Activision Blizzard, which also makes Overwatch and Warcraft, for $68.7bn (£56.5bn).
would enable Microsoft to stop Call of Duty from appearing on rival consoles, such as Sony's PlayStation 5.
UK watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), says this could lessen competition in gaming.
Microsoft says this is not the case, and is now offering the title to rivals - for a limited time.
In announcing the deal, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the same offer was on the table for Sony, if it was willing to ""sit down and talk"".
CMA has launched an in-depth investigation into the deal, saying Sony's revenue and users could be ""significantly affected"" if it loses access to Call of Duty.
It noted that previous Microsoft deals have led to games being made Microsoft exclusives, with its acquisition of Bethesda resulting in the new game Starfield only appearing on Xbox and PC.
A CMA spokesperson said: ""We are aware of these developments and will continue to monitor the competitive landscape throughout our investigation.""
Sony has been a vocal critic of the acquisition, which it said in October is ""bad for competition, bad for the gaming industry, and bad for gamers themselves"", adding it would give Microsoft ""a dominant position in gaming"".
But the 10-year offer is significant for Nintendo, which last had a Call of Duty game on its consoles in 2013.
Phil Spencer, head of Microsoft's Xbox gaming division, said Call of Duty would continue to be available on PCs through Steam, a gaming distribution service.
means that in theory the game series could also be available on the Steam Deck - a handheld gaming computer not owned by Microsoft - although this would depend on the hardware requirements of subsequent releases.

entertainment	'Snakes, scorpions and 53C heat': Gloucester stuntman on SAS Rogue Heroes	"""I saw plenty of scorpions, and snakes were being caught before we got to set, to make sure it was safe.""
Olly Lloyd, 22, from Gloucester, was one of a team of stuntmen and firearms officers filming with BBC One drama, SAS Rogue Heroes. 
Filming took place for three months in Morocco in 2021, with temperatures reaching up to 53C on some days.
x-part drama is based on Ben Macintyre's SAS Rogue Heroes book, which charts the creation of the SAS.
A constant hazard for the production was sandstorms, which frequently disrupted activity on set. 
""We'd start very early in the morning and from there go through costume,"" said Mr Lloyd.
""That was providing we didn't get hounded by sandstorms - we'd be battling with sandstorms all day.""
SAS was formed in 1941, originally conceived as a commando force in the North African campaign during World War Two.
Mr Lloyd said the experience brought him closer to the original soldiers.
""You just crack on in the heat,"" he said. 
""You've just got to do what you're doing and do your job to the best of your ability. 
""It was embodying the spirit of what the SAS went through at that time, we were living in the same conditions that they did.""
Mr Lloyd is also quite modest about seeing the final product. 
""Yes and no, if you ask whether I'm looking forward to seeing it on TV,"" he said.
""I'm less concerned about myself but more wanting to see the good work that everyone else has done. 
""I was just a small cog in a big wheel.""
SAS Rogue Heroes will premiere on BBC One on Sunday 30 October at 9pm.

technology	Elon Musk rejects concerns over beds at Twitter HQ	"Elon Musk has criticised San Francisco Mayor London Breed over an investigation into offices turned into bedrooms at Twitter's headquarters.
's Department of Building Inspections is investigating potential violations of the building code, local reports say.
Mr Musk accused the city of attacking companies providing bedrooms for ""tired employees"".
w Twitter boss recently demanded staff committed to long hours or left.
A Department of Building Inspection official told local public-radio station KQED: 'We need to make sure the building is being used as intended.""
In a reply to KQED journalist Ted Goldberg's twitter thread, Mr Musk posted the city should prioritise protecting children from the consequences of opioid drug misuse.
Last month, Mr Musk emailed all staff Twitter ""will need to be extremely hardcore"" to succeed.
""This will mean working long hours at high intensity,"" he said.
""Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.""
And in a now deleted tweet, Mr Musk posted he would work and sleep in the office ""until the org is fixed"".
Forbes initially broke the story of ""sad little conference-room sleeping quarters at the company's recently depopulated headquarters"", noting it was an apparent improvement on the improvised sleeping-bag-on-the-floor arrangement posted on Twitter by one employee.
A photo shared with the publication showed ""bright orange carpeting, a wooden bedside table and what appears to be a queen bed, replete with a table lamp and two office armchairs"", it said.
rooms, Bloomberg reported, are also said to accommodate staff from Tesla and other Musk-owned businesses brought in to work at Twitter, ""some of whom travel to Twitter for work meetings"", sources told the publication. 
Department of Building Inspection official Patrick Hannan told the San Francisco Chronicle it investigated all complaints and there were different rules for residential buildings, even those used for short-term stays.
In May 2020, prior to Mr Musk's takeover, Twitter told employees they could work from home ""forever"" if they wished to, because its remote-working measures during Covid lockdowns had been a success.

entertainment	James Corden tells viewers he was 'rude' to restaurant server	"James Corden has admitted he was ""ungracious"" to a restaurant server in an incident which saw him temporarily banned from New York eatery Balthazar.
Speaking on The Late Late Show on Monday, Corden said ""it was never my intention"" to offend restaurant staff.
Keith McNally, who owns Balthazar, said last week that Corden had been an ""abusive customer"" after some errors with his orders.
He later revealed the star had since called and ""apologised profusely"".
Addressing the issue for the first time in public, Corden said of Mr McNally's claims: ""Because I didn't shout or scream, I didn't get up out of my seat, I didn't call anyone names or use derogatory language, I've been walking around thinking that I haven't done anything wrong.
""But the truth is I have made a rude, rude comment. And it was wrong. It was an unnecessary comment, it was ungracious to the server."" 
On the latest episode of his US show, Corden said his remarks had been ""in the heat of the moment"" but said he would ""apologise in person"" to the staff at Balthazar.
Corden said that after seeing Mr McNally's post, in which he accused Corden of being nasty to his staff on two visits in recent months, he had ""immediately"" contacted the restaurant owner.
""[I told him] how upset I was that anybody was hurt by anything that I had done and anything that I had said and we had a good talk,"" he said.
""He appreciated the call. I was happy that we got to clear the air. And I felt like we dealt with it privately... but by this point, the story was out there and more people were upset.""
Corden's explanation is a change in tone from comments he made in interview in the New York Times over the weekend.
He told the newspaper that he hadn't ""done anything wrong, on any level,"" adding that he felt ""so Zen about the whole thing. Because I think it's so silly"".
Mr McNally posted that Corden had visited his restaurant in June and been ""extremely nasty"" after he showed a hair to the manager after his main course - the implication being it was in his food.
A second run-in followed in November, the restaurant owner said. An omelette was the cause of the rudeness and Mr McNally accused Corden of yelling and again, ""being nasty"".
Corden told The Late Late Show that the second incident occurred when his wife was accidentally served a dish she would have had an allergic reaction to.
Corden showed a series of tweets reacting to his behaviour to The Late Late Show audience, telling them: ""I get it. I totally understand. I understand everybody getting upset and I accept everybody's opinion.
""I also hate, as I said to the owner that day, that I've ever upset anybody ever.
""It was never my intention. It just wasn't. I love that restaurant. I love the staff there.
""I hope I'm allowed in again one day so when I'm back in New York I can go there and apologise in person, which is something I will absolutely do.""
Mr McNally lifted his ban last week after receiving Corden's apology over the phone, posting on social media: ""Anyone magnanimous enough to apologise to a deadbeat layabout like me (and my staff) doesn't deserve to be banned from anywhere. Especially Balthazar.""
Corden announced in April that he was stepping down as host of The Late Late Show.
He is expected to depart in spring next year. "	/news/entertainment-arts-63384455

Mr Sunak won the backing of Tory MPs to succeed Liz Truss after Boris Johnson abandoned his comeback bid and Penny Mordaunt also dropped out.
As well as congratulations, local Tories have issued a plea for unity.
However, their Labour counterparts have accused them of treating the nation's highest offices as ""tombola prizes"" and have called for a general election.
Guy Opperman, Conservative MP for Hexham and a backer of Mr Sunak, called him a ""serious person for serious times"".
Fellow supporter Paul Howell, the Tory MP for Sedgefield, said the new PM ""has what it takes to provide the strong leadership we need and steer the country through some very challenging times"".

Bishop Auckland Tory MP Dehenna Davison, who had backed Liz Truss for Downing Street this summer, congratulated Mr Sunak too, but warned he had a ""mammoth task ahead"". 
She said: ""The country faces huge challenges and people are counting on us to deliver, so we need to get behind Rishi now.""
Conservative Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, who had backed Boris Johnson, said that Mr Sunak had ""helped deliver projects ... that will create long-term opportunities which will transform our area"".
""I hope this is the end of the ridiculous saga that has occurred over recent times, and that Rishi, leading the government, can now concentrate on getting us through the difficult times ahead.""

But with the Conservatives set to move on to their third Prime Minister of the year and the third since the last general election was held in 2019, Labour has called for voters to be given their say now on who should be allowed to form a government.
Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Central, accused Mr Sunak of being ""scared of scrutiny and knows he has no mandate to speak for anyone"".
She said: ""The Tories are treating the highest offices in the land like tombola prizes, even as they use them to crash the economy and make working people, particularly in the North East, pay for the privilege.""

health	Ambulance delays outside A&E reach new high in England	"ressure on emergency care is greater than ever in England, latest figures show, amid fears of a spike in demand after the ambulance strike.
A quarter of ambulances, more than 16,000, were delayed for more than an hour outside A&Es - even before Wednesday's action by ambulance crews.
NHS bosses are warning of many more new patients ahead of Christmas.
And there is particular concern over those who did not seek medical help during the industrial action. 
Hospitals were quieter than normal during Wednesday's ambulance strikes, but NHS bosses have said they are worried about a rebound effect, created by people turning up in large numbers after avoiding seeking help on strike days.
Meanwhile, the number of patients with flu in hospitals in England has gone up by two-thirds in one week, with calls to the NHS 111 service increasing to near-record levels as parents seek advice about strep A.
Department for Health and Social Care said its number one priority this winter ""was to keep patients safe and ensure they can access care when and where they need it"".
usands of paramedics, call handlers and technicians took action in England and Wales on Wednesday and are set to strike again on 28 December. 
Data from NHS England for the week to Sunday 18 December shows that delays getting ambulance patients into hospital for treatment are higher this month than during any previous winters.
rget for handing over patients from an ambulance to hospital staff in England is 15 minutes.
But four in 10 ambulances arriving at A&E waited at least 30 minutes before unloading patients - up from three in 10 the previous week.
And a quarter waited more than an hour (up from 17%), which contributed to 46,000 hours of ambulance staff time being lost to delays handing over patients.
figures may explain why eight out of England's 10 ambulance services declared a critical incident on Tuesday - the evening before the ambulance strike began - because of extreme pressure.
Some are now reducing their alert level, but say they are still under immense pressure.
usands of hospital beds are also occupied by patients ready to be discharged, and these numbers are going up sharply every week.
'Not able to get out on the road'Analysis by Jim Reed, health reporter
On the picket line this week, striking paramedics repeatedly raised the problem of long handover delays. And today's figures reflect that.
In England last week, a record 46,085 working hours were lost because ambulance crews could not quickly pass on their patients to other medical staff when they arrived at hospital. 
One ambulance service calculates each hour lost costs £133 because crews are not able to get back out on the road to the next person who needs help.
A handover delay does not always mean waiting in the back of the vehicle - although this is often the case. 
may have been moved into A&E itself, but still have to be looked after by paramedics. 
w figures, though, show how difficult it has become for crowded hospitals to find space for new arrivals. 
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said 7,000 new real, and virtual, hospital beds were being created, and it was investing £500m to speed up the process of discharging patients from hospital into social care. 
It said money was also going towards recruiting more call handlers and upgrading ambulance vehicles.
On Wednesday, only the most serious 999 calls were responded to, but there was no evidence of people going to A&E in taxis or in their own cars, NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, told the BBC.
Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said there had been a reduction in 999 calls on Wednesday, but an increase in people phoning 111, as well as more people being referred to out-of-hospital services.
He also shared concern over further strikes in January, saying it was the worst possible time for the NHS to be facing industrial action.
Jason Killens, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service - where 50% of staff went on strike, warned of an anticipated rise in demand for ambulances after fewer people called 999 on Wednesday.  
Unions had agreed that ambulance workers would respond to category one 999 calls and the most serious category two calls (emergencies, including strokes and major burns) during strikes, but there would be no guarantee of a response to less urgent calls, such as falls. 
Ambulance workers in England and Wales are demanding a pay rise above inflation, which they say will improve morale and help retain staff. However, they are also protesting about being stuck in ambulances outside A&E departments for long periods, rather than attending to new emergencies.
Government ministers say most ambulance staff have received a pay rise of at least 4%, taking average earnings to £47,000. A further pay increase would mean taking money from frontline services, they add. 
A plan to improve how emergency care works in England is being prepared, and will be published in January.
Nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have staged two strikes this month, and have warned of more disruption in the new year unless progress is made in negotiations over pay.
Nurses in Scotland who are members of the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives are also set to strike after rejecting the latest pay offer of an average increase of 7.5% - an offer accepted by members of Unison and Unite.

sports	Super Bowl 2022: Meet the star-studded Rams roster set to face the Bengals	"After 29 years away, the NFL's championship game is returning to the glitz and glamour of Los Angeles.
And with Super Bowl 56 taking place in their very own SoFi Stadium, the Rams went all in to make sure they were part of the big show.
In the six years since the franchise returned to LA from St Louis, they've built a star-studded roster which befits Tinseltown and their shiny new stadium.
And the gamble has paid off. They face the Cincinnati Bengals in Sunday's title decider and British defensive end Jack Crawford will be part of BBC Radio 5 Live's commentary team in LA.
""Part of me wants the Bengals to pull it off, it'd be huge for the team, the city and the fans,"" he said. ""But I can't bet against Aaron Donald.
""Now that Tom Brady's retired, I think he's the best player in the NFL, across all positions. In a game like this, where there's so much tension, I've got a feeling he'll take the game over.""
Here Crawford, who was unable to play for the Arizona Cardinals last season because of injury, introduces the big names looking to secure the Rams' second Super Bowl win.
Drafted by the Rams in 2014, Donald's a three-time Defensive Player of the Year and helped LA reach Super Bowl 53, where they lost to the New England Patriots.
Donald is on the small side for a defensive tackle but uses his physical ability to get past opponents and get after the quarterback. He now has 102 career sacks, with 14 overall this season.
""A lot of people have speed, strength, explosiveness or flexibility, but he has it all,"" said Crawford.
""He's as strong as anybody in the NFL, his hands are very accurate and he plays with leverage - to get under offensive lineman's pads [and get past them].
""Being a defensive lineman, I understand how hard it is to do what he does consistently, when teams are trying to take him out of the game - yet he's still the league's most disruptive defensive lineman.
""In the defensive-line room, when the coach put on Aaron Donald's tape, we used to say 'what's the point of watching this? He's just a different type of human.'""
In November the Rams traded two picks in this year's draft to sign Miller from the Denver Broncos.
raft pick in 2011, he was named the game's Most Valuable Player as he helped Denver win Super Bowl 50. He already has five sacks from eight games with LA.
""He's similar to Aaron Donald in that he's the complete package,"" said Crawford.
""In the defensive-line room we talk about 'bending the corner' - when a defensive end is rushing the quarterback and forcing the offensive tackle back, how low can the linebacker stay while running at an angle towards the quarterback?
""That makes it harder for the offensive lineman to get his hands on you, and that's something Von Miller does better than anybody. He has the balance to stay low to the ground, bending his body while running full speed.""
Rams gave up two first-round picks to sign Ramsey from the Jacksonville Jaguars early in the 2019 season.
He's remained a Pro Bowler each year and in the regular season he tied his career-high for tackles and interceptions.
""Some defensive backs you'll never see in the weights room, some aren't even among the fastest players on the team,"" said Crawford.
""But their instincts are on another level, and Jalen Ramsey's ability to cover receivers is natural.
""The best DBs secure tackles and make sure they bring the receiver down, and he's a good tackler. He's physical but has finesse at the same time.""
In March 2021, the Rams decided to move on from Jared Goff and traded him and three early draft picks to the Detroit Lions for Stafford.
After being 2009's first draft pick, Stafford had used his big arm to quietly rack up 45,000 passing yards while seldom threatening the play-offs.
Now surrounded by elite talent, he tied for a career-high 41 touchdown passes before claiming his first play-off win - after 186 NFL games - and leading a game-winning drive at Tampa Bay.
""He's a pocket passer and a momentum quarterback,"" said Crawford. ""Once he gets into a rhythm he can gas the defence, and he has a lot of weapons in this offence.
""He's proven he can take control of a game and get wins. I can't overstate how hard it is to get a quarterback who's consistent, knowledgeable, and can relate to every player on the offence.""
Kupp was unheralded when selected with 2017's 69th draft pick but Stafford's arrival has resulted in a breakout season.
Kupp was named the Offensive Player of the Year after earning the triple crown of most receptions (145), most receiving yards (1,947) and most receiving touchdowns (16).
""Sometimes you get an unassuming receiver who isn't in the spotlight at the beginning but over time their stats speak for themselves,"" said Crawford.
""He reminds me of Cole Beasley or Julian Edelman, a consistent receiver with sure hands, and they bring another level of confidence to the quarterback.
""You get these dynamic duos and once they warm up, it opens up opportunities for everybody else on the offence, including the running game.""
Unlike Kupp, 'OBJ' has been a star since the New York Giants drafted him in 2014, with a one-handed touchdown catch in his rookie season going viral.
Since then, his career has been disrupted by injury, with a move to the Cleveland Browns not working out before the Rams signed him as a free agent in November.
He now has six touchdowns from 11 games for LA, including his first in the play-offs, and had his most receiving yards for more than two years in their NFC Championship win.
""I was in for that play [the one-handed catch], for Dallas at the Giants, and thought it was a [penalty] flag against him and a drop,"" said Crawford.
""I was like 'there's no way that's a catch', but then the crowd started going crazy. It was an unbelievable play and he practices those catches regularly.
""But he has great speed too. You can have a team backed up on third down then 'bang', it's a 60-yard touchdown because he can just outrun everyone."""	/sport/american-football/60335554

sports	Sports Personality of the Year 2022: Rob Burrow honoured with Helen Rollason Award	"Rugby league legend Rob Burrow has been honoured with the Helen Rollason Award at Sports Personality of the Year 2022, and ex-Leeds Rhinos team-mate Kevin Sinfield received a special BBC award.
Burrow was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2019 - two years after retiring from a 17-year career.
He was given the award for relentless fundraising and raising awareness of MND while battling the illness himself.
""This is for the MND warriors,"" said Burrow, 40.
Burrow, who uses an eye-controlled computer which recreates words into a version of his voice to communicate, added: ""We will not stop until we find a cure. I am inspired to keep going by my friend Kevin.
""I'm totally overcome with this award due to the amount of amazing people who have won this before. In particular my MND hero, Doddie Weir.
""What a fantastic guy he was. I don't think I would be here today without meeting him less than a week into my diagnosis. I will accept the award on his behalf.""
Since Burrow's diagnosis, Sinfield has raised more than £7m for charity.
Sinfield, Burrow's close friend and captain as he led Leeds Rhinos to seven Super League crowns and two Challenge Cup wins, has undertaken a series of fundraising challenges while championing MND research.
In November, the 42-year-old ran seven ultra marathons in seven days, covering 300 miles (482km) from Edinburgh to Manchester, via Melrose, Newcastle, York, Leeds and Bradford.
He smashed through his target of £777,777 - a nod to the number seven shirt worn by Burrow - and received a hero's welcome as he completed the challenge at Old Trafford during half-time in the Rugby League World Cup final.
""From the start this has been a big team effort,"" said Sinfield.
""Everyone has got behind what we have tried to do. Rob is probably the most inspirational bloke in the UK. He has inspired us to be better friends. In sport and certainly in rugby, the connections you make, the friends don't just stop when the whistle goes. 
""Sport is powerful enough to bring communities together. What we have witnessed is a nation that cares about the MND community.
""Doddie [Weir] used to say MND isn't incurable, it's just under-funded. We've got to keep fighting. We will keep banging the drum.""
fundraising challenge raised £1.5m, with the funds being split between five charities supporting people impacted by MND.
former Leicester rugby union assistant coach, who will join England's new head coach Steve Borthwick as defence coach at Twickenham, also ran 101 miles in 24 hours in 2021 and seven marathons in seven days a year earlier.
Both Sinfield and Burrow also represented Great Britain and England during their playing careers.
Burrow spent his entire club career with Leeds Rhinos, winning eight Grand Finals, three World Club Challenges and two Challenge Cups as he made more than 400 appearances between 2001 and 2017.
One of the most successful rugby league players in the sport's history, Burrow was awarded an MBE in 2021 for his services to rugby league and for his work in the motor neurone community.
Burrow read the CBeebies Bedtime Story using the technology on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities earlier in December.
Helen Rollason Award recognises outstanding achievement in the face of adversity.
It was introduced to the show in 1999 in memory of the BBC Sport journalist and presenter, who died of cancer that year at the age of 43.
Scotland rugby union great Doddie Weir, honoured with the award at Sports Personality of the Year in 2019, died in November at the age of 52 - six years after being diagnosed with MND.
Capped 61 times between 1990 and 2000, he raised more than £8m through his My Name'5 Doddie foundation.
Weir received an OBE in 2019 for services to rugby, to MND research and to the Borders community.
Last year, Arsenal and Scotland defender Jen Beattie received the Helen Rollason Award for her work on breast cancer awareness.
Previous winners include Hillsborough disaster campaigner Anne Williams, charity marathon runner Ben Smith, football fan Bradley Lowery and racing driver Billy Monger."	/sport/sports-personality/64027090

business	Morrisons to close 132 McColl's stores putting jobs at risk	"Morrisons says it plans to close 132 of its loss-making McColl's convenience stores, putting 1,300 jobs at risk.
It comes after the supermarket chain agreed to buy McColl's out of administration in May.
Workers who could be made redundant will be offered jobs elsewhere in the business, the grocer said.
Morrisons now plans to convert most of its remaining McColl's stores into Morrisons Daily shops as it tries to revive the chain's fortunes.
re are currently 1,164 McColl's stores trading, 286 of which operate under the Morrisons Daily brand.  
Morrisons said all of the stores set to close were ""loss-making"" and had ""no realistic prospect"" of recovering soon.
re distributed around England, Scotland and Wales.
majority will be closed ""in an orderly fashion"" over the rest of this year, it added.
grocer said workers at risk of redundancy ""will be offered alternative employment at a nearby McColl's store, Morrisons store, logistics operation or food-making centre"".
Out of the stores that will close, 55 have a Post Office counter.
Morrisons said it would will delay the closure of these stores until next year to let them serve local communities during Christmas ""and to allow the Post Office additional time to make alternative arrangements"".
Last week competition regulators cleared Morrisons to buy McColl's.
upermarket chain had already said it would sell 28 McColl's stores to overcome competition concerns.
McColl's is a business ""of significant scale"", Morrisons added, with an annual turnover of £1.2bn. It accounts for about 0.8% of the UK grocery market, it added.
It said no further store closures were currently being considered but it remains in talks with ""a number of landlords of challenged stores"".
Morrisons' chief executive David Potts said after the green light from the competition watchdog, the retailer was ""now able to begin the urgent journey to transform McColl's into a viable, well-invested and growing operation"".
Mr Potts added that following the store conversions, there would be more than 1,000 Morrisons Daily stores trading within two years.
Joseph Sutton, the director of Morrisons wholesale, said: ""We very much regret the proposed closure of 132 loss-making stores but it is, very sadly, an important step towards the regeneration of the business."""	/news/business-63407159
politics	Faisal Islam: Is Truss's growth plan running out of time?	"""Growth, growth, growth,"" is the metric the prime minister wants us to use to judge the effectiveness of her government. That much she made clear in her conference speech.
In forthcoming weeks we will get the economic reforms, in planning, regulation, worker visas, and elsewhere, that the PM hopes will unleash that growth.
As one minister from the John Major era, who phoned me after the speech, said, even if the strategy works perfectly, it will take time. In the mid-1990s he experienced an economic shock that affected mortgages, and that was linkable, at least in part, to government decisions. In his view ""British voters do not give credit for cleaning up your own mess"".
And will the strategy work, even in the long-run?
me of the PM's speech to conference was that she would take on the ""vested interests"" of the ""anti-growth coalition"" in order to deliver a step-change after two decades of anaemic growth. 
me of the problem, for her, is a 70-year high in taxation, which is why she is urgently prioritising tax cuts.
re is a tremendous amount of debate over why the UK has had sluggish growth, more or less since the financial crisis. But a 70-year high in taxation is not usually a big part of it.
For a start, it has never actually come about, because it has always been a forecast for future years (from the Office for Budget Responsibility), rather than fact, and it seems contrary to attribute decades of low growth to something that was only a prediction. Taxation over the past quarter of a century, under prime ministers Blair, Brown, Cameron, May and Johnson, has averaged 32.8% as a proportion of economic output, or GDP. Under Mrs Thatcher's 11 years that number was 32.4% of GDP.
It is clear that some lower taxes can help boost growth; all of this begs the question as to what has been weighing down the economy. Indeed it is striking the government's comprehensive and transformational policy agenda is proceeding without a thorough, published analysis of what the growth problem is, why it occurred here and not in say the USA or Germany, and therefore how it should be addressed. 
rings us back to the ""anti-growth coalition"". At a tense political conference, the PM was always going to focus on her external political enemies. But that coalition stretches well into her own membership in that hall.
Planning reform, for example, would help growth and productivity, but always seems to get thwarted. One interesting part of the Kwarteng growth plan refers to changing regulations to allow more onshore wind to be built. That certainly would be a statement of intent. 
What other policies could increase forecast growth so quickly that they would help the current numbers add up, when the OBR does its sums? Increasing the number of foreign workers to address the visible labour shortages around the country. Are people who oppose changes to the immigration rules for political reasons part of the ""anti-growth coalition""? Moves to lower new post-Brexit, non-tariff trade barriers for British exporters, could also help reverse recent reductions to the OBR's long-term growth forecast. Neither move is on the government's agenda. 
Number 11 may, in general, struggle to persuade the OBR that its plans will materially change the economy. And, indeed, there is then the reverse risk in the short term: that the turbulence of the past fortnight could have a permanent effect on perceptions of the UK's macroeconomic stability. 
For 20 years Britain has set the gold standard for institutional independence when it comes to economic policy, built up by successive governments. That meant low borrowing costs, even through financial, and eurozone crises, and the pandemic too. In recent weeks this administration allowed the perception to grow, that it was fiddling with these essential controls on the economy. That perception was fed by leadership campaign rhetoric, and the mini-budget's massive tax cuts, presented without hard borrowing numbers. 
Whereas sterling recovered its losses over the last few days, government borrowing costs remain materially higher. Perceptions of how high the Bank of England will have to raise benchmark interest rates are also higher. Rates were always going to get back to normal - higher levels - at some point after a decade-and-a-half of ultra-low interest rates. But it didn't have to happen so violently, in a matter of days. It is rates for mortgages and company lending that have been ""moving on up"", to echo the PM's choice of theme tune.
OBR is right now calculating how hard the extra interest rate shock will hit the economy, and how much it will cost the government too. And it is true to say that UK growth will also be affected by rising economic challenges elsewhere in the world, including the eurozone and the USA.
So if the PM's speech was light on policy, that might reflect the need to not do anything at this point, that could further spook markets. Above all, it seems the lesson of the last week may have sunk in: that macroeconomic stability, rooted in institutional credibility, is actually a prerequisite for ""Growth, Growth, Growth""."	/news/business-63144645

business	Superdry boss warns shoppers will choose Europe over Britain	"People will travel to Europe to go shopping because Britain no longer offers tax-free purchases to international tourists, the boss of clothing chain Superdry has warned. 
Under the VAT Retail Export Scheme, non-EU visitors to the bloc can recover the VAT on High Street purchases. 
But the scheme was withdrawn in Great Britain in January 2021 after the UK left the EU. 
Julian Dunkerton, who co-founded Superdry, said this was ""a blind move"".
""If one goes to Europe, now it's absolutely heaving - every hotel is full,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""Britain on the other hand, is below pre-Covid numbers.""
He warned high-spending international tourists would stop coming to spend money in Britain. 
""They're going to go to France instead of to us to do all that luxury shopping,"" he said. 
""The other aspect that people haven't realised is that we as Brits can go to France and if we're buying any high-ticket item, get a tax-free deal on that product.
""So what we're going to see, as we saw in I think it was the 80s when people used to do booze cruises, it will be worth getting on a plane, getting on a boat and going to France or going to mainland Europe and doing their shopping.""
VAT Retail Export Scheme benefitted tourist hotspots like London and Edinburgh, as well as the famous Bicester shopping village in Oxfordshire, which attracts visitors seeking bargains.
When it was withdrawn, the Treasury said it was costly and vulnerable to fraud. 
Mr Dunkerton, who was a vocal supporter of remaining in the EU, said Brexit was also ""stoking inflation"". 
He said if the government didn't tackle rising prices ""we're going to go down a very difficult path of wages spiralling out of control"".
He called on the government to increase corporation tax to help struggling households in the coming months. 
""That money [could] be used to benefit the people that need it through this winter and potentially a VAT decrease to make sure that inflation and wage costs do not get out of control this winter,"" he said. 
Combined with the windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Dunkerton said the government would then have the money to take VAT off energy bills and potentially reducing it on other products too. 
BBC has contacted the Treasury for comment.
Earlier this year, Superdry said it would increase prices on some of its clothes by around 2% due to inflation. 
rand, which started out as a market stall in Cheltenham, was set up by Mr Dunkerton and James Holder in 2003 and went on to enjoy huge commercial success.
But clashes followed between Mr Dunkerton and the board, leading to his resignation from the board and eventual return in 2019 to ""steady the ship"" after huge losses."	/news/business-62509760
business	UK faces worst downturn of any advanced economy, OECD says	"UK economy will suffer a bigger blow from the global energy crisis than other leading nations, according to international body the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
UK will contract by more than any other nation in the G7 group next year, it said.
Growth in the US and the eurozone will be weak, but Germany is the only other major economy expected to shrink.
OECD forecasts a ""significant growth slowdown"" globally in 2023.
ks to the strength of emerging economies, the world economy will grow by 2.2% next year, the OECD's latest report predicts.
But the war in Ukraine was affecting economies unevenly, the OECD said, with European countries bearing the brunt of the impact on business, trade and the spike in energy prices. 
G7 includes the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. While growth is expected to be weaker in most countries in the group, only Germany and the UK will contract, the OECD predicts.
OECD expects the UK's economyto shrink by 0.4% in 2023 to be followed by shallow growth of just 0.2% in 2024.
By contrast, last week the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted the UK would shrink by 1.4% next year, although it also predicted stronger growth, of 1.3% in 2024. The OBR said that would lead to the biggest drop in living standards on record.
Earlier this month the Bank of England predicted the downturn could last for two years.
Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to fall by 0.3%, the OECD report says.
Of the wider group of G20 countries, only Russia, which is subject to economic sanctions, is predicted to fare worse than the UK.
OECD, an intergovernmental body that focuses on economic policy, lays some of the blame for the UK's poor performance on the Energy Price Guarantee, the scheme to support household and business energy bills.
While subsidising energy bills reduces the immediate headline inflation rate, the OECD warns that it will add to overall demand in the economy, increasing inflationary pressures in the medium-term. That in turn would require the Bank of England to raise interest rates further and add to the cost of servicing debts.
""Better targeting of measures to cushion the impact of high energy prices would lower the budgetary cost, better-preserve incentives to save energy, and reduce the pressure on demand at a time of high inflation,"" it said.
UK government is moving away from universal support for energy bills after this winter, the prime minister's spokesman pointed out. 
""We're taking a different approach post-April to the energy support, targeting it towards the most vulnerable,"" he said.
In response to the OECD's forecast for the economy, he said this year the UK was forecast to be the fastest growing economy in the G7.
""These are challenges that are affecting different countries at slightly different times,"" he said. 
""We emerged from the pandemic faster than many other countries in Europe. But some of these challenges are shared,"" he said. 
Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: ""We are forecast to be the only OECD economy that will be smaller in 2024 than it was in 2019.
""This is the Tory doom loop. A low growth spiral leading to higher taxes, lower investment, squeezed wages and poor public services.""
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney described the OECD forecast as a ""damning verdict"" and said a succession of Conservative chancellors this year had wrecked hope of growth.
OECD said UK inflation - which hit a 41-year high of 11.1% in October - is likely to peak at the end of this year but remain above 9% in early 2023, slowing to 4.5% by the end of next year.
rganisation expects UK interest rates to rise from their current level of 3% to 4.5% next April and unemployment to rise to 5% by the end of 2024. 
f paying for help with energy bills showed up on the government's accounts in October, as households began receiving the first tranche of a £400 subsidy, and the lower £2,500 energy price cap came into effect.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that these schemes together cost £3.4bn in October.
ushed up government borrowing - the difference between government spending and tax income - to £13.5bn last month, the ONS said.
Although the figure was £4.4bn higher than last year it was lower than analysts had expected.
ONS said that borrowing in the financial year to date - covering April to October 2022 - was £84.4bn, although this was £21.7bn less than in the same period last year."	/news/business-63704841

It manages the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Regent hotels.

It was even one of his 10 pledges for the leadership.
Labour's instinct now is different. Very different.
Sir Keir repeatedly refused to tell me if he thought net migration was currently too high, but this is a party determined to be seen to learn one of the lessons of the Brexit referendum; a concern about the scale of immigration.
Sir Keir Starmer says he will not pick ""arbitrary migration targets"" over the number of workers coming to the UK from abroad
Yet this comes as some business leaders say they have run out of available workforce, which, they argue, is crushing growth and pushing up prices. 
And it's not just here in the conference centre in Birmingham, on a retail park next to the airport, where you hear those concerns.
We drove half-an-hour down the road to the headquarters of the National Farmers' Union near Kenilworth in Warwickshire, where the main item on the agenda of the union's National Horticulture and Potatoes Board today was the very same issue.
Ali Capper, a hops and apples farmer on the Worcestershire-Herefordshire border, told me ""there is a strong chance that it will put our business out of business"".
She said: ""It is very difficult to see a way forward when we have no clear idea how we are going to recruit next year. 
""And when the cost, the inflation that is built into that workforce every year, is going up in double digits.""
And she doesn't think politicians from either the Conservatives or Labour are listening.
Other farmers also told me there is an obvious cost to their businesses. But a moral cost too.
At a time of spiralling food prices, and some families struggling to feed themselves, food is left to rot because there aren't the workers to pick it.
Some argue too many British people aren't willing to do what can be backbreaking work.
But with unemployment at historically low levels, for now at least, the farmers argue that isn't the crux of the issue.
rux is numbers. There simply aren't enough workers.
But, six years on, the Brexit referendum is still a major contributor to the political weather and that isn't likely to fundamentally change before the general election. 
Labour have to convince the millions of voters who rejected them in 2019 that they understand the contributory factors that led to that rejection.
Sir Keir wants to frame an argument for a post-Brexit world, where ""low pay and cheap labour"" - as he put it - are not part of the ""British way on growth"".
He reckons that is an approach that ""borders on a disaster"" in the long run, and the solution is investing in people, to boost skills and productivity.
He wants to make the immigration system more responsive to short-term need, but not a crutch.
But speak to people here at the CBI privately, and they fear neither the Conservatives nor Labour get it.
Conservatives don't have a growth strategy and Labour's could prove prohibitively expensive.
re is, though, another thing worth mentioning here.
Beyond his message on immigration, Sir Keir is determined to continue his charm offensive with businesses.
He boasts of meeting over 100 chief executives in the last six months. He talks up the value of enterprise and profit. 
Labour hasn't just changed, he claims. He reckons it's been turned ""inside out"". And the Labour leader was warmly received by the CBI.
for the endorsement - or at least tolerance - of corporate Britain is on and competitive."	/news/uk-politics-63722553
health	Royal Oldham Hospital's extension given green light	"A hospital will undergo a multimillion-pound extension to tackle ""health inequalities"" and bed shortages.
Work at Royal Oldham Hospital will start in August after the building of another surgery and new emergency theatre.
Hospital chiefs said it currently has some of the ""poorest quality accommodation in Manchester"".
rtage of beds during busy periods has meant patients were regularly being treated in corridors.
xtension will provide new in-patient beds and a crucial care unit.
Members of Oldham's planning committee said the new four-storey development would address ""historic under-investment"" at the Rochdale Road site.
make way for the £28m extension, the hospital's Cafe Royal and J-block will be demolished, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Chief officer David Jago said the extension will make a ""significant contribution"" to improving healthcare service for Oldham, Bury, Rochdale and North Manchester.
Mr Jago told councillors the hospital was running a campaign, asking non-clinical staff to work from home one or use public transport one day a week to reduce parking around the hospital.
uilding plans were approved unanimously by councillors.

sports	Nations Cup: Ireland reach semi-finals in Valencia despite 2-2 draw with Korea	"Ireland's women squeezed into the semi-finals at the Nations Cup in Valencia despite letting slip a two-goal lead against Korea on Wednesday as they were held to a 2-2 draw.
Italy needed to beat hosts Spain in the later contest to deny Ireland a semi-finals spot but that game ended 0-0.
Goals from Sarah Hawkshaw and captain Katie Mullan looked to have Ireland in control but the Koreans fought back.
Ireland's likely semi-final opponents on Friday are India.
Indians are ranked eighth in the world - five spots above the Irish - and won their last encounter between the nations when clinching a 1-0 victory in the pool stages at the Tokyo Olympics.
On the way to reaching the World Cup final in London in 2018, Ireland twice beat India as they secured a 1-0 pool stages win before edging them out in a shootout in the quarter-finals after a 0-0 draw.
India will secure a meeting with the Irish providing they avoid a heavy defeat against South Africa later on Thursday which would see them topping Pool B and setting up a semi-final with the Pool A runners-up.
""They'll be a really tough opponent but it's also a great opportunity,"" Ireland head coach Sean Dancer said of India. 
""What was particularly pleasing today is that, while the senior players played well, the younger players really stepped up and at stages, they took their chances and they hurt Korea."""	/sport/hockey/63975629
business	Mercedes recalls almost 1m cars over faulty brakes	"German carmaker Mercedes-Benz is recalling almost 1m older vehicles from around the world because of potential problems with their braking system.
Over the weekend, the company said it will contact owners of the vehicles as their brakes may be affected by what it called ""advanced corrosion"".
recall affects a total of 993,407 vehicles, including 70,000 in Germany.
Mercedes recalled a similar number of cars last year over a safety issue with their emergency call system.
mpany said the vehicles in the latest recall were built between 2004 and 2015 and were from its ML and GL series of SUVs and R-Class luxury minivans.
""We have found that in some of those vehicles, the function of the brake booster could be affected by advanced corrosion in the joint area of the housing,"" Mercedes said in a statement on Saturday.
""It might be possible for a particularly strong or hard braking manoeuvre to cause mechanical damage to the brake booster,"" it said.
""In such a very rare case, it would not be possible to decelerate the vehicle via the service brake. Thus the risk of a crash or injury would be increased,"" it added.
Mercedes said it is starting the recall immediately and that the process would involve inspecting the potentially faulty vehicles and replacing parts if necessary.
Last February, the company recalled over 1m cars because of a defect in its ""eCall"" feature, which alerts emergency services of an accident and relays the vehicle's location.
fect meant it was possible that a wrong location could be sent.
Because the problem was software-related, the fix was mostly done ""over the air"" - via a wireless download using the car's existing mobile data connection.
Call system is mandatory in the European Union for all cars sold since 2018.

technology	Primark website crashes as click-and-collect launched	"Primark chief executive Paul Marchant discusses the chain's new click-and-collect service
Primark's website crashed on Monday, shortly after the retailer finally launched its click-and-collect service.
It is starting a trial in 25 stores in north-west England, Yorkshire and north Wales for children's products only.
udget chain, which lost more than £1bn in sales during the pandemic when its stores had to close, has succumbed to the online shopping revolution but it is not planning deliveries.
Primark said it was aware some people had issues accessing its site.
""We're working hard to address this to ensure that everyone can access and browse the site easily,"" the company said in a statement. 
By mid-afternoon the website appeared to be back up and running for some customers.
Paul Marchant, the retailer's chief executive, said the launch of Primark's click-and-collect service was a ""milestone for us and a really important moment"".
""We're massive fans of bricks and mortar. We believe in stores and we believe in the High Street. We think click-and-collect is the right proposition,"" he told the BBC in a rare broadcast interview.  
retailer is hoping that giving customers the chance to shop online and then pick up in store will drive more customers to its shops.
During the pandemic lockdowns Primark's 190 UK stores were forced to close its doors, and it had no online operation to fall back on. 
But Mr Marchant says the High Street now seems buoyant again. 
""We feel excited about Christmas. I think we're really well set. Our stores are feeling busy.
""It's the first time for three years that customers have been able to come into the store, mask free, restriction free and really enjoy the experience of being in a Primark store.""
Last week Primark's parent group, ABF, said it would freeze prices for Primark's clothes beyond what was already planned for this winter, despite rising costs. 
As the cost-of-living crisis bites, people have been looking to save money where they can. Supermarkets have seen shoppers swapping out of brands to cheaper, own-label products, while many people have been stocking up on warm clothes to save money on heating.
Primark itself says its snuddie, or oversized hoodie, has been one of its bestsellers so far this winter. 
retailer has defied the wider gloom on the High Street and Mr Marchant says it has picked up new customers because of the cost-of-living crisis.
""I think customers are looking for better value all the time. I think at Primark, we offer them outstanding value. And I think we are attracting new customers as a consequence of that.""
Primark has also been upping its game at its biggest ""destination"" stores, like its vast Manchester city centre one, with cafes, a barber shop, a vintage concession store and pop-up space to personalise Primark products. 
""We are, I think, the new department store, because I think we offer something for everybody but done in a new and exciting way,"" Mr Marchant says.
And this now includes dipping its toe into the world of e-commerce. 
Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth, CEO and founder of Savvy Marketing, says Primark is simply bowing to the inevitable. 
""They've had massive highly successful physical store growth, not just in the UK and Ireland, but also across the world. However, that dependency on a store-only format has its limitations as Primark found out to their cost in the retail lockdowns during the pandemic,"" she says. 
An online presence not only allows them to reach shoppers who can't easily access a store, or don't have time to queue up so want flexibility in when and where they visit, she says click-and-collect may also become important for the hordes of Primark fans to get their hands on products quickly before they sell out. 
Given the costs of fulfilling and delivering online orders, and dealing with high levels of returns, it can be hard for retailers to make the economics of e-commerce stack up. 
""Online is a huge commercial undertaking and the logistics for a business with the size and scale of Primark are enormous. Click-and-collect is the most sensible way to run this operation, not least because it allows returns to be placed back into the store stock to help keep costs down,"" Ms Shuttleworth says.

technology	Vanuatu: Hackers strand Pacific island government for over a week	"Vanuatu's government has been knocked offline for more than 11 days after a suspected cyber-attack on servers in the country.
k has disabled the websites of the Pacific island's parliament, police and prime minister's office.
It has also taken down the email system, intranet and online databases of schools, hospitals and other emergency services as well as all government services and departments. 
utdown has left the nation's population - about 315,000 people living across several islands - scrambling to carry out basic tasks like paying tax, invoicing bills and getting licences and travel visas.
Essentially anyone with a gov.vu email or domain has been affected, locals told the BBC.
""Anyone who tried to do anything with the government knew the system was down,"" said Ginny Stein, an Australian journalist and communications consultant who spent years living in Port Vila, and left on Monday.
""My experience of trying to check out of the country... well they just couldn't operate. They were really struggling to get basic things done.""
She described major delays to any applications to government as officials have resorted to manual systems and in many cases even shut up shop.
""You'd walk into the offices and they were closed or they were turning you away saying 'come back next week maybe, but we don't know',"" she said.
Still, government staff have done their best to keep things going - with some using their own personal emails and internet hotspots for essential work.
Instead of electronic transfers, people have been paid with cheques. One civil servant relayed the experience of walking from department to department to get the relevant checks and sign-offs on an application. Others have been taking notes manually.
According to civil servants who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, it appears the government's servers were taken out on Friday 4 November. 
Emails bouncing back from government addresses were the first sign something was wrong, residents said.
""If you take out the government internet… it affects everything. You want to do shipping? You've got to get stuff through approvals through customs. It affect airlines. It affects the health system - there isn't one bit of it that's unaffected,"" said Ms Stein.
No one from the government or the Prime Minister's office has yet returned the BBC's calls.
But AFP news agency and the Vanuatu Daily Post carried a government statement saying its online system had been ""compromised"" for two days. 
re appears to be a financial motivation. Australian newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald reported the attackers had demanded a ransom, which the Vanuatu government refused to pay. 
No detail has been disclosed about the value of that extortion bid, or who the hackers are.
It's also unclear how the attack occurred and what protections Vanuatu had in place. Experts have noted the whole system was likely centralised and hosted on the government's own servers, a fundamental security flaw.
ready pledged to upgrade its system. In the meantime it's asked neighbouring Australia - traditionally its largest aid partner - to help rebuild its network. 
As of Wednesday, the government domain was still down. A spokesman told the Herald the government's website ""should be back next week"".
Why might Vanuatu have been targeted?
k has come less than a month after a new government was elected - a potential time of vulnerability. ""But the new government has responded quickly and not agreed to the ransom request,"" said Dr Meg Keen, director of the Pacific Islands Programme at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute.
""We don't yet know who is behind this attack, but a government spokesman has suggested it was an outside attack, likely from the Asia region."" 
Some have speculated that the hack may have originated in Indonesia. Vanuatu has long supported the independence movement in the Indonesian province of West Papua, where much of the population is Melanesian. The Indonesian military is accused of gross human rights abuses in the province.
Others note Vanuatu's position in the Pacific region - as a key nation that has relations with the US, China, Australia and New Zealand.
r has seen Pacific Island nations courted by both Washington and Beijing. Island leaders were invited to the White House in September, while China's foreign minister carried out a whistle-stop tour around the Pacific in June seeking a regional deal.
In recent years, Vanuatu has become one of the Pacific islands closest to Beijing. Chinese investment has built its parliament house, sporting stadium and convention centre. Beijing has an embassy in Port Vila, while Washington's representation is a three-hour flight away in Papua New Guinea.
However, Australia - allied with the US - has for over four decades been Vanuatu's largest aid donor and closest security partner.
Internet provision is a critical utility. Last year, the Australian government funded its telecoms giant Telstra's purchase of Digicel Pacific, a Pacific telecoms company, in a move widely seen as a political block to China's influence in the region. 
re had been talk that Digicel might sell its Pacific arm to Chinese state-owned operator China Mobile. Australia also secured an internet cable for the neighbouring Solomon Islands in 2018.
Dr Keen said Vanuatu, like other countries, aimed to secure its government information from external attacks. She noted a ""global vulnerability"" to such attacks - including in Australia, where hacks on a health insurer and telecommunications firm in recent weeks have exposed data of nearly half the population.
But Vanuatu has far fewer resources. Its economy is largely reliant on farming and tourism. The low-lying nation has been ranked among the most vulnerable to climate change.
""The attack is an added strain on public systems,"" Dr Keen said.
Ms Stein, who had worked in government departments in Vanuatu, noted the country's internet system had appeared fragile - with variable internet coverage and limited server capacity.
""It's a really miserable thing to do to a small island nation that just doesn't have the resources to deal with this,"" she said."	/news/world-asia-63632129
health	Hunwick woman with breast cancer shows scar in charity calendar	"A woman who has stage four breast cancer has said she stripped off for a charity calendar to encourage people to check themselves and ""do something positive"". 
Kay Morris of Hunwick, County Durham, was told in March that she had less than a year to live but said she did not want to ""feel sorry"" for herself. 
She asked friends and family to appear in the Hunwick Boobs in Bloom calendar. 
""I wanted people to see my scar and see what I've been through,"" she added.
Money raised from the sale of the calendar will go to charity, Breast Cancer Now. 
Ms Morris said: ""Back in March I was told I had less than a year to live so rather than feeling sorry for myself I wanted to raise money for breast cancer charities.
""It doesn't matter how old you are, what gender you are, you are still able to get breast cancer, so it's so important to keep checking your breasts.
""In the calendar I wanted people to see my scar and see what I've been through. This is all about raising awareness.""
Ms Morris' son Liam volunteered along with some friends to be in the August picture. 
He said: ""I'll do anything for charity and anything for my mam. So I became a builder for the day in a pink hard hat.""
Geraldine Ganning-Smith, co-ordinator of the Hunwick Boobs in Bloom 2023 calendar, said: ""We had a tremendous amount of fun making it, a lot of prosecco was drunk.
""We also had a tremendous number of volunteers who we couldn't have done it without.""

sports	Commonwealth Games: NI's Kate O'Connor second in heptathlon after superb day one	"Northern Ireland's Kate O'Connor is in second spot after day one of the Commonwealth Games heptathlon following a brilliant series of performances.
O'Connor, 21, set personal bests in the opening 100m hurdles and 200m.
runs came either side of solid high jump and shot put marks which means O'Connor goes into day two second behind Katarina Johnson-Thompson.
English star is 109 points clear but O'Connor is 52 points ahead of third-placed Australian Taneille Crase.
O'Connor set a personal best of 13.74 in the opening 100m hurdles before clearing 1.78m in the high jump which left her fourth at that stage on 1968 points.
As defending champion and favourite Johnson-Thompson produced a below-par shot put, O'Connor's season's best of 13.73m moved her to within 11 points of the 2019 world champion.
mpson-Johnson regrouped with an impressive 200m win in 23.70 to significantly extend her lead but O'Connor's latest personal best of 24.73 - which cut 0.09 seconds off her previous mark - saw her consolidate second spot.
Holly Mills, tipped to be team-mate Johnson-Thompson's closest challenger, could only manage a 200m time of 25.12 which left her 54 points behind O'Connor in fourth spot.
Another English athlete Jade O'Dowda also remains in medal contention, 74 points behind O'Connor, with the second Northern Ireland competitor Anna McCauley is sixth spot nearly 500 points off the pace.
Wednesday's remaining three events are the long jump, the javelin, where O'Connor is normally strong, and the concluding 800m.
It was a mixed day for Northern Ireland's boxers - expected to provide the bulk of the country's medals - as Aidan Walsh stormed into the quarter-finals but team-mate Eugene McKeever exited after sustaining a cut eye early in his fight.
Olympic bronze medallist boxer Walsh dominated his opening light middleweight contest to reach the quarter-finals in Birmingham as he earned a unanimous win over Lesotho's Arena Pakela.
Belfast man's left jab was in Pakela's face throughout the contest as the African simply couldn't get near the Tokyo medallist.
Bafflingly, the Sri Lankan judge only gave Walsh a narrow 29-28 verdict with the other four correctly deciding that the Monkstown club fighter had won conclusively.
Walsh's team-mate McKeever will consider himself extremely unfortunate to have been eliminated in his last-16 contest against Gambia's Stephen Zimba.
Welterweight McKeever sustained a cut above his left eye following an accidental clash of heads in the opening round.
Initially the cut was seen to and the bout was allowed to carry on, until it reopened followed a right hand from the Gambian which prompted the referee to bring a halt to proceedings.
Northern Ireland's men's bowling pair Martin McHugh and Sam Barkley lost their bronze medal match as they were beaten 25-5 by Scotland's Paul Foster and Alex Marshall.
Northern Ireland made a promising start to lead 2-0 after two ends before the Scots quickly took control.
Scottish pair picked up a key five at the third end, followed by a four, a single and another four to lead 14-2, with Northern Ireland unable to mount a comeback. 
Whitehead's McHugh, competing at his seventh Commonwealth Games, was part of Northern Ireland's gold medal-winning fours team in Kuala Lumpur in 1998. 
In the women's triples, Northern Ireland's Ashleigh Rainey, Chloe Wilson and Courtney Meneely beat Falkland Islands 22-10 but NI's women's pair Megan Devlin and Shauna O'Neill lost 14-13 to England.
Gary Kelly won his opening men's singles game as he defeated Norfolk Island's Ryan Dixon 21-12.
In the pool, Daniel Wiffen and Danielle Hill both progressed to finals. 
Armagh man Wiffen comfortably qualified for Wednesday evening's men's 1500m freestyle final, finishing second in his heat in 15 minutes 37.53 seconds.
Wiffen conserved his energy to qualify fifth fastest as his time was almost 40 seconds slower than his Irish record set last month when he just missed out on a place in the final at the World Championships.
A repeat of that sub-15 minute swim could put him in medal contention in Wednesday's final.
Hill reached the women's 50m backstroke final after placing fourth in her semi-final in 28.28 seconds, which left her as seventh qualifier.
kyo Olympian's time cut 0.04 off her morning semi-final performance as she reached her second final at the Games after finishing seventh in the 50m freestyle final.
Barry McClements, after winning Northern Ireland's first ever Commonwealth Games swimming medal on Friday, had to settle for sixth place in the S10 100m butterfly final.
McClements is a S9 swimmer and was taking on S10 competitors who are significantly faster on the clock.
Newtownard man's time of 1:02.95 left him over six seconds behind Australian winner Col Pearse, who led the three S10 swimmers who filled the podium positions.
Mollie McAlorum clocked 31.77 to win her 50m backstroke heat but that time was not enough to qualify, while Grace Davison (30.49) also missed out.

Leeds-born novelist was known for the DCI Alan Banks series of books, set in Yorkshire.
ries were adapted into an ITV series with Stephen Tompkinson, which ran from 2011 to 2017.
His publisher said he had died after a short illness on Tuesday. Tributes have been paid by fellow crime writers Val McDermid and Ian Rankin.
Robinson emigrated to Canada in 1974 after studying English Literature at the University of Leeds.
He lived in Toronto with his wife Sheila Halladay.
He remained true to his roots by setting his DCI Banks novels, the first of which was published in 1987, in the fictional Yorkshire town of Eastvale.
ries has sold more than 8.75m books, his UK publisher Hodder & Stoughton said.
In 2020, he was granted the Grand Master Award from the Crime Writers of Canada, having previously been given their Derrick Murdoch Award in 2010.
His editor and managing editor of Hodder & Stoughton Carolyn Mays said he was a combination of ""all the best bits"" of his Alan Banks character.
""Thoughtful and passionate about justice, he had fine taste and a totally down-to-earth view of the world,"" she said.
Ms Mays said he had a wry and very dry humour and was a ""Yorkshireman to the core"".
""Much that he did was done without fanfare, like the scholarship he created at the University of Leeds, where he himself took his first degree, to sponsor students through an English literature and creative writing course.""
She said their hearts were with his family and friends and the ""many thousands of fans who will miss his work so much"".
""Most of all with his beloved wife Sheila, to whom he dedicated every single book he wrote.""
Ms Mays said his final work Standing in The Shadows was set to be published in March and was ""perhaps his finest work yet"".
Paying tribute on Twitter, author Val McDermid wrote: ""Sad to hear of the death of Inspector Banks.
""We were both first published in 1987, and our paths often crossed, (usually accompanied by beer) in Canada and his beloved Yorkshire. Condolences to Sheila.""
While Ian Rankin also paid tribute tweeting: ""Hellish news about my dear friend Peter Robinson. Spent many a wonderful evening in the company of him and his partner Sheila.""

technology	Russia-linked cyber attack could cost Gloucester City Council £1m	"A cyber attack linked to Russian hackers could cost the council £1m to fix, leaders have warned.
Benefit payments, planning applications and house sales were delayed after Gloucester City Council's IT systems were compromised in December.
uthority had to rebuild all of its servers after malware infected its systems.
Officers have been working to restore services but costs keep rising, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
rmful software was embedded in an email which had been sent to a council officer.
Known as sleeper malware, it is understood to have been dormant for some time before it was activated.
Following the attack, Gloucester City Council said its sources alleged the cyber attack was carried out by hackers from Russia.
Liberal Democrat group leader Jeremy Hilton asked councillors on 29 September how much it had cost so far to restore the IT systems and what the estimated final bill would be.
""Every time I ask the question about the costs of the cyber attack recovery, the cost rises more and more. 
""It now stands at a whopping £787,000.
""Can you reassure members of the council that the final bill will not be more than £1m?""
Deputy leader of the council Hanna Norman (Cons) told the meeting she could not give that assurance.
She said all parties involved in the recovery were doing it in the most cost effective manner because they were spending Gloucester taxpayers' money.
""I can give you the assurance that every penny we spend is scrutinised and we are making decisions based on value for money and what is right operationally for this authority and therefore Gloucester residents.""
She confirmed the council had spent £787,000 spent to date, of which £142,000 went on capital works.

business	Port of Felixstowe: More strike action possible, says union	"union on strike at the UK's busiest container port warned there could be further industrial action.
Workers at the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk walked out on 27 September for eight days after the union Unite rejected an imposed pay deal.
About 1,900 union members also took action in August, with Unite asking for a pay rise to match the rate of inflation - currently at about 10%.
rt said its pay increase of 7% plus £500 was ""very fair"".
Hutchison Ports, part of a multi-national conglomerate based in China, previously said the ""bargaining process has been exhausted"" between in port and the union, but Miles Hubbard, regional officer for Unite said he did not accept that.
""This is the second tranche of strike action; people are as determined as they have been to stick it out and, if necessary, take further action,"" he said.
Mr Hubbard told BBC Politics East that workers wanted ""a fair share and a pay rise which comes close to matching inflation"".
""The company have further provoked the workforce by imposing the pay offer,"" he said.
Mr Hubbard said 82% of union members had rejected the 7% offer ""so we're here for the long haul"".
A spokesman for Hutchison said in a statement: ""The port is in the process of implementing a very fair pay increase of 7% plus £500.
""The pay award is effective from 1 January [2022] when CPI inflation was 5.4%.
""One branch of Unite at the port has already put the same pay offer to their members, who voted to accept it.
""The next pay rise is due 1 January 2023, and we will discuss that with Unite in the normal way.""
One of the workers on strike at the Port of Felixstowe was Andrew Godwin.
""At the moment nationwide there is a cost-of-living crisis affecting everyone, none more so than here,"" he said.

technology	Kate Bush: The Lambeg that gave Running Up That Hill its thunder	"Singer Kate Bush ordered a Lambeg drum from a shop in Belfast
One of Northern Ireland's most mysterious musical stories has been given new life by the resurgence of one of the most famous pop songs of the 80s.
On one side - Kate Bush, the enigmatic singer-songwriter, and Running Up That Hill, which has hit number one in the UK charts a full 37 years after its original release. 
Back then, the song went to number three in the charts but thanks to prominent usage in Netflix's horror smash Stranger Things, it will become Bush's second number one of her career, a mere 44 years after Wuthering Heights.
On the other side, the Lambeg drum - Northern Ireland's most iconic musical instrument, a seriously loud and huge piece of kit with a booming sound made famous by street parades.
Unlikely musical bedfellows perhaps - but no better way to ring out Running Up That Hill's ""thunder in our hearts"" than with the thunderous timbre of the Lambeg.
Kate Bush, one of the biggest pop stars in the world at the time, seemed to think so. 
Which is why William Hewitt, a drum maker on Sandy Row in Belfast, found himself with a strange request back in the early 1980s - and why the singer ended up with a bespoke drum, adorned with white fluffy clouds and apparently dubbed The Cloudbuster.
Elizabeth McKinley, William's daughter, told BBC News NI all about how her father - who ""wasn't really an excitable man at the best of times"" - came home to tell her the star had come into his Drum Sounds shop.
""She'd come into the shop with two young boys and apparently they were members of the band and someone had put her in the direction of my father as the drum maker - and he said 'you'll never guess who she was?', and he told us it was Kate Bush. He was very happy about it.
""He knew of her music, that would've been all - never would've dreamt he would've met her.""
ry of Kate Bush and the Lambeg has taken on mythical status in Northern Ireland music circles.
Bush, famously reclusive, hasn't released any new music in 11 years, almost never gives interviews and rarely plays gigs - her first run of concerts since 1979 came eight years ago.
Her music has occasionally returned to prominence in the years since her heyday in the 80s and early 90s - for instance, when The Futureheads yodelled-up cover of Hounds of Love turned into an indie hit in 2004.
But for the most part, Bush and her music remains an enigma - and likewise, so does The Cloudbuster. She has never spoken about it and its status is unknown. Meanwhile, William Hewitt, its maker, has since died. 
However, Northern Ireland music journalist Stuart Bailie and former musician Mike Edgar took up the story in an online video posted in 2020.
In it, Edgar - a member of Cruella De Ville, a Belfast-based band signed to record label giants EMI in the 1980s - recalled how his A&R man John Bagnall, who also represented Kate Bush, asked him if he could source a Lambeg for her. She had seen one on TV and wanted to know if she could get her own.
Perhaps it shouldn't have been that surprising that Kate Bush would look to this side of the Irish Sea for musical inspiration.
Her mother, Hannah Daly, was from Waterford in the Republic of Ireland and an Irish dancer. The album Hounds of Love would go to feature a track called Jig of Life, which included an extended coda of traditional Irish music. 
Renowned traditional Irish musicians Dónal Lunny, John Sheahan and Liam O'Flynn played on the record. 
Despite famously composing much of Hounds of Love on a synthesizer - the Fairlight CMI - she melded those electronic sounds with acoustic folk instruments, such as balalaikas, bouzoukis and didgeridoos. And, of course, the Lambeg. 
According to Edgar, it was he who put the initial calls in to William Hewitt to arrange the drum to be made. He also recalled how it came to be painted with clouds.
Lambegs are traditionally associated with parades across Northern Ireland, with drummers beating out marching tunes. Usually they are painted with images associated with the Orange Order. But Kate Bush's request was a little out of the ordinary.  
""She had a particular picture she wanted on it,"" said Elizabeth McKinley. ""And father was used to doing the like of King Billy (King William of Orange) or orange lillies. But he had done banners so was quite a good painter, he was able to do the clouds and the picture from what she described she wanted.""
Elizabeth said it was Bush herself who came to get the drum and that she later wrote to thank her father.
""It's just a lovely thank you letter and it was handwritten and signed 'Kate Bush' - I have it somewhere. Somewhere among memorabilia…""
She also said Bush sent her father a video clip of the drum being used when recording the album.
rum, said Elizabeth, would have cost £300 or £350 in those days but now, even without being used by a beloved pop star, a brand new Lambeg would fetch about £4,000.
made drums - about 40 or 50 that William Hewitt would have made during his career - are still around, said Elizabeth. ""They're all out there somewhere, a lot of Lambeg men in the country have bought them and collected them over the years.""
She added: ""I was very proud of him. Proud of the banners every Twelfth, to stand and watch those banners come down - and certain drums would have my father's stamp on them and I would've known there's my father's (drum) heads. My father put the heads on that drum.""
rums are William Hewitt's legacy. And, now, so is the UK's number one single, finally at the top of the charts almost four decades after he tightened the drumheads on what would come to be known as The Cloudbuster.
Now, when Elizabeth hears the song and tells this story she thinks of him. She added: ""I think about him all the time."" "	/news/uk-northern-ireland-61844728
sports	Olympics: Super Saturday at London 2012 named greatest British summer Games moment	"When it comes to choosing Great Britain's greatest moment at a summer Olympic Games, there is only ever going to be one winner.
Yes, it has to be Super Saturday at London 2012, when Jessica Ennis-Hill, Greg Rutherford and Mo Farah all won gold in an unforgettable 44 minutes inside the Olympic Stadium.
A BBC Sport panel of Olympic experts selected it as their greatest moment from a list of 25 inspirational and emotional moments down the years.
You also picked Super Saturday as your favourite in our online poll, with the moment capturing 34% of the vote to finish a clear winner.
Here is how the BBC panel ranked the moments:
No-one will ever forgot what took place in front of 80,000 jubilant spectators at London's Olympic Stadium on Saturday, 4 August, 2012
Ennis-Hill, the golden girl of Team GB, smashed her own British record to win the heptathlon, Rutherford took gold in the long jump with a fourth-round leap of 8.31m and finally Farah, who would go on to win the 5,000m seven days later, stormed to 10,000m gold.
All in the space of a quite astonishing 44 minutes at a home Games.
It came after Britain had already won golds in men's coxless four rowing, women's double sculls and women's cycling team pursuit earlier that day.
In 1996, after winning his fourth straight gold at his fourth Games, Steve Redgrave vowed to never get back in a rowing boat again. But he could not be kept away and, aged 38, teamed up with Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell and Tim Foster at Sydney 2000 to win a lung-busting fifth gold in a thrilling - and emotional - race.
British quartet held off the Italians to win by just 0.38 seconds as he sealed his place in the Olympic record books.
In 1980, Sebastian Coe was the world record holder and the overwhelming favourite for the 800m but got his tactics wrong in the final and his great rival Steve Ovett beat him to the gold.
Coe, stung by only winning silver, had a chance to make amends in Ovett's main event, the 1500m, and took it with a gutsy display, while Ovett had to settle for the bronze. Coe crossing the line with his arms stretched wide and eyes bulging showed how much it meant to him. Their intense rivalry continued until the next Olympics in Los Angeles in what were extraordinary times for British middle-distance running.
Chris Hoy won gold in the kilo time trial in Athens but the event was dropped for Beijing 2008 and he had to switch his training to three new events. But that was no problem as ""the Real McHoy"" powered his way to team sprint gold with Jason Kenny and Jamie Staff and then individual sprint and keirin golds.
Scot was in a class of his own and became the first Briton in 100 years to win three golds at one Games.
At London 2012, Hoy defended his keirin title and also won gold in the team sprint, giving him six golds in his Olympic career, a total later matched by Kenny in Rio.
Kelly Holmes, a former sergeant in the army, had been dogged by injury problems throughout her career but everything she did turned to gold at Athens 2004. She claimed a thrilling victory in the 800m final before securing the 1500m title five days later, becoming the first Briton for 84 years to achieve the Olympic middle-distance double. 
It was the her look of sheer joy and disbelief as she crossed the line in the 800m that was arguably the defining image of the Games.
After dominating on his way to gold in Moscow in 1980, Daley Thompson faced a titanic battle against his great rival and world record holder Jurgen Hingsen four years later. Under immense pressure on day two, Thompson threw a personal best in the discus and then all-but sealed his victory in a dramatic pole vault competition, celebrating with a back-flip for good measure. He strolled his way to gold in the final event, the 1500m, despite Hingsen's world record being there for the taking.
An incredibly competitive athlete, Thompson was a maverick, controversially whistling while the national anthem was played during the medal ceremony, but also charismatic and popular.
Gymnast Max Whitlock made history when he won Britain's first-ever Olympic gymnastics gold with victory in the men's floor event in Rio. But one was not enough and two hours later he added a second by beating British team-mate Louis Smith to gold in the men's pommel horse.
""I've completely outdone myself,"" Whitlock told BBC Sport. Whitlock also won a bronze in Brazil and has five Olympic medals in total - he looks well placed to add to his tally in Tokyo.
Becky Adlington was just 19 in 2008 when she won a stunning 400m freestyle gold to become the first British woman to take swimming gold since Anita Lonsborough in 1960. She pipped American Katie Hoff in a grandstand finish which also saw her team-mate Jo Jackson capture the bronze.
Adlington was in such dazzling form she won a second title five days later, smashing the 800m world record and becoming the first British swimmer for 100 years to win more than one gold at a Games.
Great Britain's women won a first Olympic hockey gold medal by beating defending champions the Netherlands in a dramatic penalty shootout in Rio. It was watched by a staggering BBC TV audience of 10 million. The final finished 3-3 in normal time, with Britain's goalkeeper Maddie Hinch making a string of remarkable saves.
And the Dutch, the current world champions, could not beat Hinch in the shootout, which Britain won 2-0 with Helen Richardson-Walsh and Hollie Webb scoring the decisive penalties. 
Nicola Adams took centre stage as women's boxing made its debut at the London 2012 Games, 108 years after the men. She showed her class to beat China's world number one lightweight Ren Cancan and become the first female Olympic boxing champion.
Four years on in Rio, she beat Cancan again in the semi-finals before outscoring Sarah Ourahmoune of France in the final. And so it became a double first for Adams who also entered the history books as the first female boxer to defend a title.
Laura Trott and Jason Kenny's relationship came to public attention when they sat behind David Beckham at the beach volleyball at London 2012, where they won four golds between them.
In Rio, Jason and Laura sealed their status as sporting legends. Jason won three golds, and his sixth in total, to share the record with Sir Chris Hoy as the holder of the highest number of Olympic golds for any British athlete. Laura won two golds and is Britain's most successful female Olympic athlete in history with four. 
Five weeks after their Rio heroics, they were married and in August 2017, Laura gave birth to a little boy named Albert.
Ben Ainslie had already won three golds and a silver coming into the 2012 Games and was clear favourite to land a fourth title in his home waters of Weymouth. Claiming his rivals had ""made a big mistake"" by attempting to gang up on him, an angry Ainslie applied all his skills and tactical nous to claim arguably the greatest gold of his stellar Olympic career.
Wales' Jade Jones was only 19 at the London Games but helped by a raucous crowd and her steely determination she sealed a stunning taekwondo gold, celebrating with wide-eyed joy.
Four years later, she defended her crown, living up to the nickname 'the Headhunter' by clinching gold with crucial head kicks in the final round of the -57kg final.
Bradley Wiggins was unstoppable in the summer of 2012. Days after becoming the first Briton to win the Tour de France, fans lined the streets of London to watch him take Olympic gold in the road time trial. Later that year he was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year.
In Rio, Wiggins won his fifth gold as part of the team pursuit squad on the track, making him the most decorated British Olympian with eight medals, five of them gold.
Charlotte Dujardin and her wonderhorse Valegro put dressage on the map with two outstanding golds in London. First up was the team event and along with her coach and mentor Carl Hester and Laura Bechtolsheimer, they set an Olympic record to take gold. Days later, Dujardin and Valegro were going for individual glory and in a routine accompanied by music including the Great Escape and Land Of Hope and Glory, gold number two followed.
Four years later in Rio, they defended their individual title and also won a silver in the team event. Valegro was retired later in 2016 but Dujardin still has her sights set on a golden hat-trick in Tokyo next year.
1992, Linford Christie was up against world record holder Leroy Burrell but he powered his way across the line in 9.96 seconds to become, at 32, the oldest 100m champion in Olympic history, and only the third Briton to win the Games' greatest prize.
Four days later, Sally Gunnell secured a brilliant gold in the 400m hurdles. Stalking the favourite, American Sandra Farmer-Patrick, Gunnell took the lead with 100m to go and never let it go, throwing her hands to her head in ecstasy as she crossed the line.
But in between those great moments of joy, there was heartbreak for Derek Redmond. Redmond's hamstring popped half way through the 400m semi-final but he refused to give up and his father Jim ran on to help his son limp across the line to a huge roar from the crowd. His determination to finish has become an illustration of the Olympic spirit.
Mo Farah's bid to defend the 5,000 and 10,000m double he won at London 2012 was in the balance when he was accidentally tripped by his training partner Galen Rupp during the 10,000m. But he got up, rejoined the pack and went on to win another jaw-dropping gold. 
It was a stunning victory and ensured Farah became the most successful British Olympic track and field athlete of all time. Seven days later he retained his 5,000m title in another gripping race to land the double double.
ummer of 2012 was an emotional rollercoaster for Andy Murray. He reached his first Wimbledon final on 8 July but was beaten by Roger Federer, prompting a tearful response from the inconsolable Briton. Weeks later he returned to Wimbledon and produced the perfect performance to defeat Federer in straight sets to become Olympic champion.
Four years later, there was another Murray masterclass as he beat Juan Martin del Potro in a pulsating final to defend his title.
At the London 2012 Olympics, Alistair stormed to a famous victory with brother Jonny taking the bronze but if that was good, Rio 2016 was even better. Nobody had ever defended an Olympic triathlon title but Alistair was in imperious form and won gold again, with Jonny claiming the silver medal on an unforgettable day for the Brownlee family.
After years of missing out on an Olympic title, there were tears of joy when Katherine Grainger finally won rowing gold at her home Games in 2012. The Scot almost quit after a third silver in Beijing but she formed an unbeatable partnership with Anna Watkins in the double sculls to capture that elusive gold. She would win another silver in Rio to finish her career with one gold and four silvers.
Victoria Pendleton was aiming for three golds at London 2012 but a painful disqualification in the team sprint quickly dashed that dream. The keirin was next, and with British fans decked in red, white and blue, the velodrome erupted with joy when Queen Victoria claimed gold.
Show jumper Nick Skelton became Britain's second-oldest Olympic gold medallist in his seventh Games. The 58-year-old, who had retired in 2000 after breaking his neck in two places, claimed individual gold after a nerve-wracking six-way jump-off.
It was Britain's first individual show jumping medal since 1972, and added to Skelton's win in the team event at London 2012.
At Munich in 1972, Northern Ireland's Mary Peters became a star of British sport after pipping home favourite Heide Rosendahl of West Germany to win a thrilling pentathlon gold with a world record score. The competition went down to the final event, the 200m, and Peters took gold by just 10 points. Bringing the medal home to Belfast, she united the people of Northern Ireland during one of the most turbulent periods in its history.
Her inspiring performance also laid the foundations for future heptathlon champions Denise Lewis and Jessica Ennis-Hill, and hopefully Katarina Johnson-Thompson next year in Tokyo.
One of Barry Davies' best lines of commentary sums up a victory to savour as Britain's men's hockey team won gold in South Korea at the 1988 Games. 
Winger Imran Sherwani scored twice and striker Sean Kerly added the other as GB beat Germany 3-1 in a final that thrilled the nation and made stars of the players, with Sherwani's crucial second goal prompting Davies' immortal quote. 
Four golds from four brilliant track and field athletes. Great Britain's entire golden tally at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics came from Lynn Davies (long jump), Ken Matthews (20km walk), Ann Packer (800m) and Mary Rand (long jump). 
Packer and Rand also contributed three more medals to Britain's overall total of 18, with Rand (then known as Mary Bignall) claiming silver in the pentathlon and bronze in the 4x100m relay and her Tokyo room-mate Packer taking silver in the 400m.

health	Hampshire and Isle of Wight NHS trusts declare critical incident	"A critical incident has been declared in hospitals across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.
Five out of seven trusts in the counties said they were experiencing ""significant and increasing pressure"" on services.
Hampshire, Southampton, Portsmouth and Isle of Wight NHS trusts and South Central Ambulance are affected. 
A spokesperson for the integrated care board said it was ""purely due to acute winter pressure"". 
firmed it was not linked to current or pending strike action.
Dr Lara Alloway, from Hampshire and Isle of Wight Integrated Care Board and chief medical officer for Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said the ongoing pressure on local NHS services is ""significant"". 
She said: ""Hospitals, urgent treatment centres, minor injuries units, GP practices and ambulance services are all being significantly impacted.
""Dedicated health and care teams are working round-the-clock to ensure patients receive the care they need.""
Dr Alloway added ""nearly all"" hospital beds were full across the county.
Isle of Wight NHS Trust announced a critical incident more than two weeks ago due to pressures on services. 
Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, comprising Andover War Memorial, Basingstoke & North Hampshire and Royal Hampshire County Hospitals, said it was facing challenges discharging patients from hospitals.
Dr Alloway called on friends and family to help pick up patients and take them home. 
She added: ""We know people recover more quickly when they are back home rather than staying in hospital for too long. If you can, please help a friend in leaving hospital to get back in their own homes more smoothly and in time to celebrate Christmas.""
Meanwhile, South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb), which serves North East Hampshire, has also announced a critical incident. 
As a result of the critical incident, only those with life-threatening conditions and injuries are being asked to attend emergency departments.
Hospitals are also encouraging patients to use the NHS 111 online service as phones are busy and consider getting a flu jab. 
Dr John Knighton, from Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust, said: ""The length of delays being experienced and the lack of capacity to treat emergencies puts patient safety at significant risk. 
""We apologise for the delays accessing urgent services, but rest assured we are doing everything in our power to meet the need.""

business	Cost of living: 'No-one likes us. We DO care. We are Millwall'	"A chant delivered for decades on the terraces of Millwall football club goes: ""No-one likes, no-one likes us, no-one likes us. We don't care.""
But Christine Cunningham knows that is not true. The club and its fans do care - especially now when the soaring cost of living is making life so hard for those who live in the neighbourhood.
58-year-old benefits from the on-site food bank which is stocked in part by donations brought by supporters on match days.
""It is the difference between having something hot on a bit of bread, or nothing,"" says Mrs Cunningham, a grandmother of 11.
""I felt a bit too proud to come at first but, blimey, those food prices are high and there is only so much you can cut back on.""
Lions Food Hub is inside Millwall's stadium - The Den - in Bermondsey, south east London. It is run by Kelly Webster, a former player for Millwall's women's team - the Lionesses - who herself has struggled for money in the past.
""I've been homeless, in a hostel eating sweetcorn and hotdogs. Now, I felt I had to give something back,"" the 46-year-old says.
Having hung up her boots, she provides food for about 50 local families at the hub, serving people aged anywhere between their early 20s and mid-70s.
Milk, food, butter, sausages, mince and a range of canned food all come in, or are bought from cash donations, then go out to those in need.
It seems an unlikely location for a food bank, but reflects a wider campaign among English Football League (EFL) clubs to support their local communities.
fact that it is Millwall who is at the vanguard of this campaign is significant. For many years, the club has suffered from a poor reputation, in part caused by the behaviour of some of its fans, hence the ""no-one likes us"" chant.
Steve Kavanagh, the club's chief executive, says that the notoriety means they have to work harder to help out a primarily working-class fan base and local community.
""You soon realise this is a family club, and we can see what people are facing at the moment,"" he says. ""Like all families, it can be dysfunctional and difficult, but we look after each other. We feel we have to go even further because of our history."" 
mphasise his point, he is speaking in the club's boardroom which is full, not of wealthy football club bosses, but of locals enjoying a free coffee morning.
weekly session began when Covid lockdowns were lifted, giving older fans the chance to come somewhere safe and to encourage them to get back out into society. Now, it has a financial element too, and is a warm place for people to meet.
Among them is 88-year-old Kenneth Saville, who says he comes to the coffee morning for ""family, company and cake"". 
His son and carer, Peter, says: ""Everyone is welcome here. It doesn't matter if you are a [Millwall] supporter, or not.""
re are people across the country just like Kenneth, Peter and Christine - all affected in different ways by the soaring cost of living - who are getting some support from their local club.
Some are offering cheaper, or free, tickets but - as Mr Kavanagh points out - that is not always appropriate for someone who cannot afford the petrol or fare to get to a match in the first place.
So instead, much of the support is practical, ranging from a cafe at Cambridge United and free wi-fi at Middlesbrough, to debt advice at Rochdale and a warm room at Rotherham United.
revor Birch, chief executive of the EFL, says it means ""real tangible help"" for those people hit hardest by the cost of living.
""While EFL clubs support people all year round, we recognise that now more than ever we should come together and maximise the power of our network to support people who are struggling,"" he says.
Data provided to BBC News by debt charity Citizens Advice shows why such support is often necessary.
It carries out debt assessments for people seeking help. While people typically owe less money than equivalent clients in the past, an increasing proportion are in the red after covering their basic outgoings, known as a negative budget.
As a whole, those going through debt assessments typically have 1p left at the end of the month after essential spending - such as food, heating and rent - reflecting the impact of rising prices and bills.
why so many people, possibly football supporters themselves, need extra support - some of which is being provided by their local club.

business	Cost to fuel a lorry is up £20,000 a year, says haulage boss	"Soaring fuel prices have put the haulage industry in crisis with the cost of running one lorry up £20,000 on last year, a freight boss has said.
Lesley O'Brien, director of Freight Link Europe, said ""pretty much everything you buy comes on the back of a truck"" so customers were paying more.
Her comments come as the RAC said it now costs £98 to fill the average car with petrol and £101.86 with diesel.
motoring group has called for ""radical government intervention"".
Latest figures from the RAC show the average cost of a litre of petrol rose from 177.88p on Sunday to 178.50p on Monday - a rise of 0.6p in 24 hours.
Over the same period, the average diesel price rose from 185.01p to 185.20p.
RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: ""Drivers need to brace themselves for average fuel prices rocketing to £2 a litre which would mean a fill-up would rise to an unbelievable £110.
""We strongly urge the government to take drastic action to help soften the impact for drivers from these never-before-seen pump prices."" 
Motorists have been hit by record pump prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to an increase in the cost of oil because of supply fears.
In March, the government cut fuel duty by 5p a litre. It said this would save a car driver on average £100 a year, a van driver £200 and hauliers £1,500.
In some circumstances, haulage firms and other transport businesses can reclaim 100% of VAT on fuel paid for business purposes via HMRC.
Ms O'Brien told the BBC's Today programme: ""This certainly is a crisis as we've seen fuel prices escalate over the last year by 50% and no sight of a stop, so we absolutely as an industry need to keep on top of this.
""As a country we need to understand we need to support our transport industry which is the infrastructure of the whole economy,"" she said.
Ms O'Brien said fuel was a third of her business' running costs. This time last year, it would cost about £41,000 a year in fuel for an average articulated lorry at her company, but with prices soaring it now costs more than £61,000 a year.
She explained that her company added a fuel surcharge to its bills, to cover fluctuating prices. 
""But never before has it been so high,"" she said. ""As an example, to run one of my artic vehicles is now costing me £20,000 more per year than in did last year.""
Another firm, Countrywide Coaches told the BBC it had had to sell two coaches due to the rising price of diesel.
Director Olivia Bell from Countrywide Coaches said she had tried to mitigate rising diesel costs by putting up prices for some of her school customers - but parents ended up pulling their children off the school trip altogether. 
Her family-run company is now down to 14 coaches, catering to schools, private and military staff trips.
""Since September's price rise, we are paying an extra £2,000 per week in fuel costs. So we are hitting Plan B by selling coaches,"" she added.
Rod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association (RHA), said: ""Fuel represents over a third of a trucks operating costs yet profit margins are between 1% and 2%.
""To put this into perspective, the average 44 tonne truck gets less than two miles from a litre of fuel. That's why every penny increase makes a massive difference and as such, every penny must be made to count.""
Some 30% of fuel costs are duty taxes and the RHA wants the government to return this to ""essential users"" such as hauliers and coach operators. They could then lower their prices to customers, the RHA said.
Ms O'Brien said: ""If we help the haulage industry and we have an essential user rebate we will help everybody because pretty much everything you buy comes on the back of a truck and we will be able to pass that on to the end user.""
ralling cost of fuel had added to pressures including a driver shortage, subsequently high salaries and an increase in companies' national insurance payments, she said.
On top of that there was an increase in lorry maintenance costs and a shortage of new lorries and parts due to a global shortage of chips.
Meanwhile, a plan to name and shame petrol stations that fail to pass on a cut in fuel duty is ""still in the works"", a government source has told BBC News.
A formal announcement had been expected last week, but it is understood officials at the Department for Transport are yet to finalise the policy."	/news/business-61716039
politics	Tory MP Mark Francois criticised for using 'outdated' racial slur	"Labour MP Sarah Owen asks the Speaker how to ""discourage"" the use of such phrases, as used by Mark Francois in the Commons
ry MP Mark Francois has been criticised for using an ""outdated"" racial slur in the House of Commons. 
Mr Francois said he meant ""no disrespect or offence"" when he referred to Japanese people as ""Japs"" in the chamber on Monday. 
Labour's Sarah Owen, the first MP of South-East Asian descent, said the ""crass racial slur has fallen well below the bar we should expect"". 
Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle urged MPs to choose their words ""carefully"". 
He added that he recognised ""the casual use of racial terms causes upset and should not be used"".
Mr Francois used the term during defence questions, saying: ""Given the defence budget is likely to come under great pressure, why does it take BAE Systems 11 years to build a ship the Japs can build in four?"" 
Neither Sir Lindsay nor Defence Secretary Ben Wallace condemned the use of the term, which has not been regularly used in the Commons since the 1940s, during the session. 
Raising a point of order the following day, Ms Owen, who has represented Luton North since 2019, said: ""Mr Speaker, you rightly and regularly remind us to use respectful language in this House, but unfortunately, this outdated and crass racial slur has fallen well below the bar we should expect.""
She added: ""Could you please advise me on how we can discourage all members of this House from using ethnic slurs such as this because progress is not inevitable, it is something that we must consistently and constantly strive for.""
In response, Sir Lindsay said the guide to parliamentary procedure states that ""good temper and moderation are the characteristics of the parliamentary language and [I] ask all members to remind themselves of that principle in choosing the words they use carefully.""
He added: ""People reflect also the language that we use - if we set the best of language, therefore others might follow."" 
In a statement, Mr Francois said: ""I meant absolutely no disrespect or offence to anyone by using the phrase 'Japs', during defence questions in the House of Commons yesterday.

entertainment	Jonah Hill to stop promoting films to protect his mental health	"Jonah Hill has announced he will stop promoting his films to protect his mental health.
Superbad actor said he had suffered from anxiety attacks for 20 years, which were ""exacerbated by media appearances and public facing events"".
He will not do any promotion for his new documentary, Stutz, which is about his relationship with a therapist.
Psychologist Dr Sandra Wheatley told Radio 1 Newsbeat his decision was ""a really important message"".
She said the fact that ""somebody who has so much to lose is actually prepared to step back"" should be applauded.
Jonah, 38, opened up about his mental health in an open letter published by Deadline ahead of Stutz, which he directed and is about the therapist he began seeing in 2017.
film was shot in secret and follows the Hollywood star's journey with his therapist, while exploring mental health in general.
""I have come to the understanding that I have spent nearly 20 years experiencing anxiety attacks, which are exacerbated by media appearances and public facing events,"" he said in the letter.
""I am so grateful that the film will make its world premiere at a prestigious film festival... and I can't wait to share it with audiences around the world in the hope that it will help those struggling.
""However, you won't see me out there promoting this film, or any of my upcoming films, while I take this important step to protect myself.""
Dr Wheatley, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society, told Newsbeat that when celebrities are on stage or at a film premiere they're still performing.
""But when they're offstage, they go back to who they really are,"" she said.
""So celebrities have to remember this persona in the media is an impersonation that you have, not you as an individual and that can be hard to balance.""
Consultant psychologist Dr Elena Bailey agrees that celebrities are ""very vulnerable"" when they're in the public eye.
Dr Bailey, who works at The Chelsea Psychology Clinic, said stepping away from the media was a ""self-protective behaviour"".
""This is because the type of attention and feedback and commentary on your life can have a very big impact on your mental health, causing a lot of anxiety, negative thoughts, symptoms of depression,"" she said.
Spiderman actor Tom Holland recently announced on Instagram he was taking a break from social media as he found it ""overwhelming"".
And last year, actor Ryan Reynolds discussed how anxiety had an impact on his life and work. 
""For those who are working in the media, social media becomes a job, it becomes self-promotion,"" Dr Wheatley said.
""The public would put something up on their social media pages and it's for a chosen audience, like friends or family.
""But for celebrities it's a very absent audience so they don't know how it's going to be received, which ultimately sets a very different objective and why their anxiety is heightened.""

politics	No more money to fund public sector pay rises - Swinney	"re is no more money to fund public sector pay rises, according to Scotland's finance secretary.
John Swinney told BBC Scotland that although cash had been moved around in the health budget to give NHS staff a better offer, further pay uplifts would mean cuts elsewhere.
A number of groups including teachers and firefighters could strike if pay disputes are not resolved.
Mr Swinney announced £615m of spending cuts in his emergency budget review.
It came on top of £560m cuts to public services in September.
John Swinney expects an ""eye-watering"" amount of spending cuts and tax rises for Scotland
In order to fund the £400m needed to give NHS staff a new pay deal, £38m was taken from the mental health budget, £65m from primary care services and £70m from ""social care and National Care Service re-profiling"".
Asked whether other workers such as teachers had been put to the back of the queue, Mr Swinney said pay negotiations were ongoing.
He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""I'm making provision to enable us to afford particular pay deals, that's the prudent thing for me to do. 
""But my message of yesterday - and I have no other way other but to communicate it directly and clearly - I have nowhere else to go to fund pay deals other than what the government offers.
""If people are concerned about gravity of decisions yesterday, the next stage to free up more money would have ever more significant consequences and I'm not prepared to do that.""
f living in the UK is rising at its fastest rate in 40 years while the Bank of England has predicted inflation will peak at 11%.
Many unions in Scotland have said they want workers' pay to keep in line with inflation - and although the Scottish government said it was committed to fair pay deals, many offers have not matched this target.
Last  week, hundreds of firefighters gathered outside the Scottish Parliament to call for higher pay and staffing.
Members of the Fire Brigade Union (FBU) are being balloted on a 5% pay offer - which union leaders are recommending they reject.
And last month teaching union, the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), opened a strike ballot in pursuit of a 10% pay rise, after 94% of members rejected the government's 5% offer.
Andrea Bradley, the union's general secretary, told the BBC that Wednesday's unveiling of spending cuts did not change teachers' thinking ""at all"" about the pay claim.
She said: ""With it's quite sizable budget, [the Scottish government] does still has flexibility to make political choices we think that would much more strongly nurture and support and provide resources for public services, including education. 
""The other thing we would like to have seen the Scottish government do before this point is use a greater number of its tax-raising powers and other levers to perhaps have avoided us getting into this type of situation.""
't so much a negotiating position as a cry for help from John Swinney.
finance secretary is effectively backed into a corner. He's cut £1.2bn from this year's budget, much of it to fund pay deals, but it still might not be enough.
He's effectively telling unions not to come back asking for more - but given members are voting for industrial action, many will feel they have to.
Given it too is battling with rising costs and inflationary pressures, the government will be sympathetic to the difficulty many households are in.
And pay deals are, in a way, the ultimate cost of living support measure, putting more money directly into the pockets of workers. 
But for all that, Mr Swinney insists that funding for an NHS pay settlement is staying within the health portfolio, it still means less cash for Covid vaccinations, primary care improvement and mental health.
Politics is all about balancing competing priorities. And in lean times the government can only stretch so far to satisfy one area before others begin to snap.
Scottish Union Trade Congress (STUC) has called on the Scottish government to use its tax powers in 2023 rather than make cuts, a move that opposition parties have supported.
Scottish Labour's Daniel Johnson said: ""We believe those with broadest shoulders should always be paying fair share, and that means re-examining tax across the board. 
""I would expect UK colleagues to do that and expect the Scottish government to do that.""
Craig Hoy, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, said that although he would not put himself in Mr Swinney's shoes, he believed the choices he had made were the wrong priorities.
He said: ""I would support fair pay settlements in public sector in same way I would support a fair taxation system. 
""We have to recognise if we want to maintain our public services and we need to borrow our way through some of the issues we're seeing, then you can only do that in three ways - tax rises, public spending cuts or greater borrowing or greater growth.""
Asked if he would consider raising tax in the next financial year, Mr Swinney said: ""That is of course an option and something I'll consider once I see the UK government's announcements.
""They will shape fiscal context in which we're operating and I will reflect carefully on that."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63497844
technology	Google Translate used to talk to Ukrainian refugees - North Tyneside Council	"A council resorted to using Google Translate to communicate with Ukrainian refugees due to not enough interpreting services being available.
North Tyneside Council said it had a peak of Ukrainians fleeing Russian attacks arriving in April and May. 
While the authority had access to translation services, council officers said the facilities ""were just not enough"" to cope with the high demand.
Officers added they were using everything they could to provide help.
re are 258 Ukrainian refugees living in North Tyneside, with a further 37 expected to arrive in the next weeks, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Ian Rice, the authority's welfare and tenancy support manager, said: ""We do throughout the authority have access to interpreters and translation services. 
What we very quickly found was that whilst we do have access to those facilities, the numbers, particularly in April and May time, were just not enough.
""So, we used Google Translate.""
Council staff also used a translating service on Microsoft Word to email and correspond with Ukrainian guests, which officers acknowledged ""might not always be perfect"".
However, officers claimed no guests had yet complained and added it had helped open up dialogue. 
fficers added that professional translation services were sought for more complex circumstances.
In addition, several refugees had also stepped forward to help officers as interpreters.
""We have had a couple of our Ukrainian guests help us out and volunteer to translate and a number of our guests who are school teachers have helped,"" Mr Rice continued.
""We are using everything we possibly can to help and support them and quite a number of them speak quite good English,"" Mr Rice said.
He added that the government and the Red Cross had also provided translation materials in Russian and Ukrainian.

business	US economy shrinks again sparking recession fears	"US economy has shrunk for the second quarter in a row, a milestone that in many countries would be considered an economic recession.
US, which uses additional data to make that call.
But the contraction, at an annual rate of 0.9% in the three months to July, has drawn widespread attention as worries about the economy grow.
Prices for groceries, petrol and other basics are rising at the fastest pace since 1981.
As the US central bank raises borrowing costs quickly to try to cool the economy and ease price pressures, fears are rising that a recession is coming - if it has not officially started already.
Faced with sinking public confidence, US President Joe Biden has tried to make the case that the economy remains sound, noting that the unemployment rate remains at a low 3.6% and hiring has remained strong.
""If you look at our job market, consumer spending, business investment - we see signs of economic progress,"" Mr Biden said Thursday, noting the historic post-pandemic gains the US experienced last year. ""There's no doubt we expect growth to be slower than last year .... That's consistent with a transition to stable, steady growth and lower inflation.""
week, ahead of the data from the Commerce Department, he told reporters that the economy was ""not going to be in a recession"". That prompted his opponents in the Republican party to accuse the White House of trying to redefine the term.
""White House recession 'rebrand' won't reduce Americans' suffering,"" they said. 
In the first three months of the year, the US economy shrank at an annual rate of 1.6%. At the time, economists attributed the decline in gross domestic product (GDP) to quirks in trade data. 
But Thursday's report showed more marked slowdown, with growth weighed down by declines in the housing market, business investment and government spending. Consumer spending grew at a slower annual rate of 1%, as people spent more on healthcare, accommodation and dining out, but cut back on goods and groceries.
Harvard professor Jeffrey Frankel previously served on the National Bureau of Economic Research committee, the group of academics that is charged with making the official declaration of recession. 
He said he did not think a recession started at the beginning of the year, noting the strong jobs growth. But after that he was less confident.
""Things have already slowed down, so I'm not saying that everything is great,"" he said. ""Odds of a recession going forward are substantially higher than for a random year.""
Inflation in the US hit 9.1% in June, the fastest pace of price appreciation in more than four decades. 
On Wednesday, the US central bank responded to the problem with another unusually large increase to its key interest rate, its second 0.75 percentage point rise since it started raising rates in March.
By making borrowing costs more expensive, the Federal Reserve is hoping to reduce spending on items such as homes and cars, in theory easing some of the pressures putting up prices. But lower demand also means a decline in economic activity. 
Recent reports have shown consumer confidence falling, the housing market slowing, and the first contraction in business activity since 2020. 
US stock market has sunk since the start of the year, and companies from social media giant Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to carmaker General Motors have said they plan to slow hiring. Some other firms, especially in the property sector, have announced job cuts.
Sasan Kasravi lost his job in June working as a speech and debate coach in the Bay Area. 
31-year-old said he was not personally worried about facing a long bout of joblessness. But his views of the economy are bleak, consistent with surveys showing less than 15% of Americans describe economic conditions in the US as good.
""I think everybody is sort of waiting for the pandemic to blow over, for the war in Ukraine to settle down, but that's not going to resolve any of the inherent systemic flaws,"" he says, citing high housing costs, student debt and speculative bubbles in sectors like crypto.
""It seems to be built on stilts and we're all wondering if this is the thing that sends it plunging."" 
Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said this week that he did not think the US economy was in recession, but he noted that some slowdown had begun and more was likely to be necessary for inflation to return to more normal levels.
Just how severe the expected downturn will be remains a matter of heated debate.
""The last time we saw inflation this high, in the 1980s, we had a pretty deep recession,"" said Laura Veldkamp, finance professor at the Columbia Business School. She said policymakers have learned from that experience, raising hopes for a milder downturn.
But slowdowns in China and in Europe, which has been hit harder by the surge in energy prices from the war in Ukraine, raise risks from abroad. Nor is the US alone in raising interest rates.
""Many other countries have more serious problems... and they will very likely get hit and that could spill over to us,"" Prof Frankel said.
He said it was important to consider factors such as the labour market to determine the start of a recession, noting that some downturns, like the burst of the dot com bubble in 2001, would not qualify as a recession under the two-quarters-in-a-row-of-contraction rule, despite the many jobs lost.
Estimates of output in the large US economy often get updated significantly as more data comes in. Even in the UK, there are cases of recessions getting revised away.
Politics, he added, has nothing to do with it, at least historically.
""Every knowledgeable macroeconomist knows that recession in the US is not defined by a mechanical rule,"" Prof Frankel said. ""But given the polarisation of politics, there are people who are going to be cynical about it and assume the worst."""	/news/business-62310355
sports	Commonwealth Games: Joshua Stacey, Rosie Eccles and Ioan Croft win golds for Wales	"Para table tennis player Joshua Stacey and boxers Rosie Eccles and Ioan Croft added three Commonwealth Games golds for Wales.
Stacey defeated Lin Ma in the final of the men's classes 8-10 singles to become Wales' first table tennis Commonwealth Games champion.
Eccles and Croft both won finals, while Taylor Bevan picked up a silver in a record-breaking boxing medal haul.
Wales now have 27 medals, with eight gold, six silver and 13 bronze.
re is a chance of another medal on the final day of competition with table tennis duo Anna Hursey and Charlotte Carey competing for a bronze medal in the women's doubles.
Aidan Heslop and Ruby Thorne also compete in the mixed synchronised 10m platform diving final.
Wales celebrated a record-breaking Commonwealth Games boxing tally of two gold, one silver and three bronze.
It beat the one gold, two silvers and three bronze medals achieved at the 1958 Empire Games, the forerunner to the Commonwealths, in Cardiff.
It was a brilliant display of boxing from light-middleweight Eccles as she kept the attacks coming against Kaye Scott, forcing two standing counts.
referee called it a day in the second round with a third and final standing count.
""I thought if there's ever the opportunity, take it,"" said Eccles.
""To get it by stoppage in the final, I have no words.""
26-year-old, who took silver in the welterweight category four years ago, is only the second Welsh female to win Commonwealth boxing gold after Lauren Price, who went on to become Olympic champion.
""It was always two dreams; Olympic gold medallist and Commonwealth champion,"" said Eccles.
""One is ticked off. There are a few more steps to go and hopefully we will be there. 
""To be on the number two podium last time round, it hurt. To now be on top - I am going to have my national anthem played, I can't believe it.""
Eccles has overcome some setbacks including nerve damage in her arm in 2020 that left her fearing for her career and in chronic pain.
She suffered the injury just weeks before the original Olympic qualifying event in London in March 2020. 
She lost her opening bout and her only shot at reaching the Olympic Games in Tokyo.
""It was heart-breaking,"" she said. ""The team I have got around me, if you could write down the perfect team, I have got it. My family have been through the mill with me.""
Eccles has stayed motivated and overcome the setbacks, adding: ""I am stubborn and a glutton for punishment.
""There have been some close calls, my health has not been great. Training has been at times horrendous just to get through it. It's been a mission to say the least.
""But I have real faith in my team. They said even though you feel bad, you are looking good. I just kept that faith.""
Welterweight Ioan Croft, who had seen his identical twin brother Garan win boxing bronze, defeated Stephen Zimba from Zambia to claim gold in a unanimous decision.
""It is a dream come true,"" said Ioan Croft.
""I have wanted to do this since I saw the guys do it in Glasgow (in 2014). 
""The last four years I have been very hard working towards this moment and I knew this going out tonight.
""It all came down to those nine minutes and it was punch perfect, it could not have gone any better.
""This week is only a small part of the journey.""
Light-heavyweight Bevan lost to Scotland's Sean Lazzerini in a tight final which was decided on a split decision.
""I still feel gutted because I have come off a loss. I feel when the dust has settled, I will be proud of what I have done,"" said Bevan.
""I think the (semi-final) did affect me a little bit. I don't want to make excuses but I did not really sleep last night, I was aching quite a lot after a tough fight yesterday.
""But he was the better man in there today and he deserved the win.""
Stacey won 25-23, 5-11, 9-11, 11-6, 11-5 to claim an overall 3-2 victory against his Australian opponent in the table tennis.
""It's something I have worked for for the last four years,"" said Stacey.
""To have finally done it, it's an unreal feeling. It's been my goal for the last four years after getting bronze on the Gold Coast.""
So how will Stacey be celebrating? 
""I will probably call my Nan, I'd like to speak to her,"" he said.
""My Gramps passed away in April so this is for him.
""My Nan came to watch from the groups to the semis. It's probably the first time she has ever watched me properly - what a stage to do it on.""
Stacey also thanked Simon Oyler, a development manager with Table Tennis Wales, who came to his school in Cardiff and discovered his talent.
""I would like to thank Simon very much after all he has done for me,"" added Stacey.
""If it wasn't for him I wouldn't be here now and I am forever grateful."" 
Geraint Thomas finished eighth in the men's road race after his bronze medal in the time trial and says it will be his last Commonwealth Games.
Eluned King, who had earlier won bronze on the track, was Wales' top finisher in eighth place in the women's road race.
Olympic champion Elinor Barker completed the race in 41st place, just five months after giving birth to her son Nico. 
""Just racing felt like a win for me,"" said Barker.
""I put myself forward (for selection) and did not really expect anything, so for Team Wales to have the belief that it was worthwhile me coming meant a lot.
""I knew it was going to be touch and go, but I thought if I had the tiniest opportunity to represent Wales I needed to go for it.
""I am glad I did and I have enjoyed myself.
""It was good and hard but I just don't have the intensity at the moment. Every lap was a little bit harder and it kind of snapped towards the end. 
""I am a little bit disappointed, but I am glad I could do a little help for the girls.""
Diver Aidan Heslop finished eighth in the men's 10m platform final. 
Wales' men finished in sixth place in the hockey after a 2-1 loss to 2018 silver medallists New Zealand.
Despite the defeat, Wales secured a best competition finish having won a group game for the first time in their history at the Games in Birmingham.
""That was our target before we came here, to be the most successful team, which we've achieved,"" said Wales captain Rupert Shipperley.
""The group's aspiration is much higher and we're on the right trajectory. There's still a little way to go but we're definitely moving in the right direction.""
On the last night of athletics, Melissa Courtney-Bryant finished 10th in the women's 1,500m, won by Scotland's Laura Muir, while Jennifer Nesbitt and Beth Kidger placed 12th and 13th in the women's 5,000m final."	/sport/commonwealth-games/62452989
business	EU energy rationing can't be ruled out, Shell warns	"Rationing of energy in Europe cannot be ruled out, the boss of energy giant Shell has warned, due to worries over the supply of gas from Russia.
Speaking at an energy conference, Ben van Beurden said a ""really tough winter in Europe"" was ahead, with energy prices set to see ""significant"" rises.
Energy prices jumped earlier this year after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Russia has also been accused of using gas ""as a weapon"" by limiting supplies in response to EU sanctions.
Last month, Germany moved closer to gas rationing after it triggered the ""alarm"" stage of an emergency gas plan to deal with shortages, amidst fears of tighter supplies. The highest level of the plan would allow the state to intervene and prioritise energy allocation to households and emergency services.
week, Russian natural gas supplies to Germany via the Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 1 were halted for 10 days of annual maintenance work, but there are fears that supplies may not restart.
Italy has also reported shortages in gas supply, with Italian energy giant Eni revealing last month it was only getting half of the 63 million cubic metres per day it had requested from Gazprom.
Speaking at the Aurora Spring Conference in Oxford, Mr van Beurden said: ""It will be a really tough winter in Europe.
""Some countries will fare better than others but we will all be facing a very significant escalation in energy prices.""
EU is heavily reliant on Russian fossil fuels, with Russia supplying 40% of its natural gas. It also supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil, receiving around €400bn ($430bn; £341bn) a year in return.
made moves to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in response to war Ukraine, banning most oil imports by the end of 2022. It has committed to reducing gas imports but it's proved harder to agree further measures, such as an outright ban.
Member states have been been trying to store gas during the summer ahead of higher winter demand for fuel, but Russia's latest moves to reduce supply have deepened concerns the continent may struggle to build up sufficient reserves.
Europe's gas stocks are 62.6% full and there are fears that meeting the target of at least 80% for winter will be difficult.
Several countries, such as Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands had their Russian gas deliveries suspended after they refused a Russian demand to pay in roubles.
UK imports less than 5% of its natural gas from Russia, but is reliant on Norway for a third of supplies.
re are concerns that if Russia cuts supplies to the European Union further, or the bloc boycotts purchasing gas, then competition for supplies would increase.
So while the UK would not be as badly hit by supply disruption as the EU, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand increases.
Earlier this week, the head of the UK's energy watchdog, Ofgem, warned that domestic energy bills would rise faster this winter than previously forecast.
One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than £1,200 a year to UK domestic bills in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay £3,244 a year from October, then £3,363 a year from January.
government is in talks with energy firm Centrica about re-opening a giant gas storage facility in case European supplies from Russia are cut off."	/news/business-62167060
health	Dr Heather Steen to be removed from medical register	"A senior doctor is to be removed from the medical register after she was found to have attempted to cover-up the circumstances of a young girl's death.
Paediatrics consultant Dr Heather Steen was found to be unfit to practise after an investigation into the death of nine-year-old Claire Roberts in 1996.
A medical tribunal examining the doctor's case ruled that the majority of allegations against her were true.
Claire's mother said it was ""just the start of getting full justice"".
""I am angry at Dr Steen for putting us through 26 years of mental torment,"" said Jennifer Roberts.
""When we look back that night [when Claire died] we put our trust in doctors.
Jennifer Roberts says she is ""relieved and angry"" after the tribunal ruling
""We left Claire that night thinking we would see her in the morning.
""I will never forgive her.""
Mrs Roberts described her daughter as ""fun-loving, happy and full of energy"".
At the time of Claire's death, her parents were told she had a viral infection that had spread from her stomach to her brain.
But in 2018 a public inquiry determined that she had died from an overdose of fluids and medication caused by negligent care at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children.
quiry also concluded there had been ""cover up"" and the girl's death had not been referred to the coroner immediately to ""avoid scrutiny"".
Dr Steen had previously been found by the General Medical Council (GMC) to have acted dishonestly in trying to conceal the circumstances of Claire's death.
Dr Steen denied the allegations from the GMC.
was then put to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS), which rules on doctors' fitness to practise.
When the case reached the tribunal stage Dr Steen twice applied to be voluntarily removed from the medical register and was twice refused.
Had that been successful the tribunal would have been halted as she would no longer have been a doctor.
However the tribunal continued and examined allegations that between October 1996 and May 2006 Dr Steen ""knowingly and dishonestly carried out several actions to conceal the true circumstances"" of Claire.
ribunal concluded that many of the allegations against her were true, including:

While the decision to remove Dr Steen from the medical register is a milestone, Claire's mum and dad say their fight will continue until everyone is held to account.
In its ruling, the tribunal said it took into account that ""Dr Steen's dishonesty persisted between 2004 and 2006, culminating in her knowingly giving inaccurate evidence to the coroner's inquest into Claire Roberts' death"".
ribunal said that was done to conceal the true circumstances of the death.
It also said Dr Steen's dishonesty extended to concealing from Claire's parents the true circumstances of her death, despite their desire to discover what had happened to their daughter.
ribunal said fellow practitioners would consider Dr Steen's behaviour in seeking to cover up the cause of Claire Roberts' death to be deplorable.
It concluded that Dr Steen's fitness to practise was ""impaired by reason of misconduct"".

politics	Suella Braverman: We have failed to control our borders	"Suella Braverman blames the ""people smugglers"" and ""people coming here illegally"" over Channel boats crossings.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman has admitted the UK government has failed to control its borders, blaming migrants and people smugglers for chaos at Kent's Manston processing centre. 
However, she also said the Home Office needed to improve its efficiency.
MPs heard the home secretary had been warned four times keeping migrants at Manston may be breaking the law.
Previous reports suggested Ms Braverman was told failing to provide alternative accommodation was in breach of the law.
Ms Braverman told the Home Affairs Select Committee she would not comment on leaked documents. 
However, she said she was aware from September Manston had a problem.
During the committee session, Ms Braverman struggled to reply to a question from Conservative MP Tim Loughton who asked what legal routes were available to refugees who are not part of the Ukraine, Hong Kong or Afghanistan relocation schemes. 
""If you are able to get to the UK, you're able to put in an application for asylum,"" said Ms Braverman. 
Mr Loughton responded that for some refugees, illegal entry was the only way to get to the UK. 
""I think the point is that there's a shortage of safe and legal routes other than for specific groups of people,"" he said.
What safe and legal routes are there to the UK?
Manston was designed as a holding site for a maximum of 1,600 migrants who arrive on small boats - each for a maximum of 24 hours - but at its peak there were 4,000 people there. 
In October, inspectors found families who had been sleeping on mats in the marquees for weeks. 
A man who became unwell while staying at the centre died in hospital on Saturday. He is believed to have crossed to the UK in a small boat earlier in November, and Home Office staff are trying to contact his family. 
On Tuesday, the Home Office confirmed the site had been cleared, helped by bad weather in the English Channel causing a sustained fall in the number of crossings.
Delays in processing asylum claims are taking their toll on refugees' mental health. 
Ubed, an Iraqi Kurd, arrived in the UK by boat 17 months ago with his wife and daughter and claimed asylum in the first few months, but has heard nothing since. 
family is living in one room in a Wakefield hostel while they wait for a Home Office response to their case. 
""When I first came to the UK I was happy. I arrived and felt safe. Since that time it's got worse. My mental health and my family's mental health is degrading,"" Ubed told the BBC.
Dame Diana Johnson, who chairs the select committee, said Ms Braverman was told on 15 and 22 September and 1 and 4 October that the Home Office did not have the power to detain migrants waiting for onward accommodation.
mmittee heard that 36 people who had been held in Manston had been returned to Albania, under the government's agreement to return migrants and offenders.
ut of 12,000 Albanians arriving in the UK this year, up from 800 last year and 50 in 2020, according to official figures. 
Dan O'Mahoney, the Home Office's clandestine channel threat commander, also said there was one Albanian police officer working with officials at the Kent camp.
ry MP Lee Anderson told Ms Braverman more asylum seekers are being housed in hotels because ""the Home Office has failed to control our borders and it's not fit for purpose at the moment"". 
Ms Braverman said: ""We have failed to control our borders, yes, and that's why the prime minister and myself are absolutely determined to fix this problem.""
Earlier Ms Braverman told MPs: ""I am very clear who's at fault. 
""It's the people coming here illegally, people smugglers, people who are choosing to take an illegal and dangerous journey to come here for economic reasons.""
me secretary is aiming to quadruple the rate at which asylum cases are processed by staff as the government attempts to tackle the backlog in the system.
Ms Braverman told the committee that, on average, each staff member was deciding one asylum case per week at present.
Home Office has doubled the number of asylum staff to more than 1,000 and plans to recruit another 500 decision-makers by March.
Ms Braverman said: ""We want to deliver sustainable changes to reach a minimum of three decisions, per decision maker, per week by May."" 
mbition is four decisions per week, she added.
Ms Braverman was also pushed by MPs on the government's policy to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda in a bid to reduce the numbers crossing the Channel. 
, under which the UK has paid Rwanda £140m, is currently on hold as it faces a legal challenge in the court. 
me secretary insisted she still had confidence in the scheme and believed the courts would rule it to be legal.
Matthew Rycroft, the most senior civil servant in the Home Office, said it did not yet have evidence the scheme would be value for money. 
Responding to the issue of the lack of safe and legal routes into the UK, a Home Office official said the UK had offered asylum to more than 380,000 people since 2015, including those from Hong Kong, Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine. 
fficial outlined other legal routes for people from other countries.

health	Friends' 24-hour Clifton Suspension Bridge Movember walkathon	"wo friends are spending a freezing night repeatedly walking over the Clifton Suspension Bridge to raise money for men's health. 
Jacob Dimery and Matthew Green began their Movember challenge at 8:00 GMT on Wednesday and are due to finish at 8:00 GMT on Thursday. 
unched in 2003 and sees men grow moustaches during November to get sponsorship for male health issues. 
money goes towards issues like suicide prevention and cancer research.
Over the years the event has grown, with people undertaking a variety of challenges to raise money. 
Bristolians Jacob and Matt are hoping to raise a total of £2,880, or £1,440 each.
On average one man takes his own life every minute, and the 1,440 figure represents the number of minutes in a day. 
By 14:00 on Wednesday, Jacob and Matt had walked about 38,000 steps, or 19 miles. 
According to BBC West's calculations, they could have hit 72 miles by the morning.   
Speaking at 18:00 Matt said: ""Our legs are starting to get a bit sore but we are doing alright.""
""We had done a couple of challenges before and we felt like this would be our next level, pushing the envelope a little bit more, broadening our horizons and hoping to raise more money for men's mental health, prostate cancer and the Movember charity.""
r previous challenges include running a mile every hour for 24 hours, and a double ""Murph"" - a mile run followed by 100 pullups, 200 push ups and 300 squats repeated twice. 
Jacob, a nutritionist, was inspired to start raising money for Movember after losing a friend to suicide.
""Nine years ago I lost a very close friend of mine who I would probably say to this day if we had talked a lot more we wouldn't necessarily had the outcome that did happen,"" Jacob said.
""I think we all concluded that men just simply don't talk enough.""
Matt, who has had his own mental health difficulties, said: ""Movember felt like a good thing to keep supporting to help people get to the other side of their struggles.""

technology	Bournemouth DVD rental store Flicks closes after 40 years	"A DVD store that has rented films for almost 40 years is closing its doors, unable to compete with online streaming sites. 
Flicks in Bournemouth, Dorset, started out in the mid-1980s, when VHS machines were the height of technology. 
DVDs and videos from the shop will be sold off and any films left boxed up are set to be put into storage. 
Manager Terry Whitaker said one of his suppliers told him there were as few as 10 DVD rental shops left in the UK now.
He said he liked remembering the ""good old days"" but people ""watch films differently now"". 
When Flicks first opened VHS machines were still in use but DVDs soon took over and now streaming sites rule.
Mr Whitaker began working at the store 27 years ago.
""When I started it was part-time, then two years became 10, then 20,"" he said. ""But it never felt like work, I've always enjoyed it here.
""I found some old VHS machines, they're heavy, bulky things, and we kept a stash of the original Star Wars trilogy hidden away. I also found two old Braveheart posters,"" the 50-year-old said. 
""With a movie like Crocodile Dundee, people used to have to wait for it to come out on video, then they'd have to reserve it. Pretty Woman was the same. 
""You wouldn't just walk in on the day it was released, you'd have to book or pre-book it before it even came out. 
""Those were the good old days.""
Mr Whitaker said streaming had made watching films ""less of an occasion, definitely"". 
""Back then, you'd come in as a family and pick a film each and sit round, have the build up and watch it as a family and eat popcorn.
""But people just watch films differently now, on iPads, phones - people will have two TVs in their homes so they'll watch movies separately now"", he said. 
re manager said he ""wasn't too sure"" what he would do once the store closed for good. 
""I've got a couple of months to close down the company yet, then I'll find something else,"" he said.
""My favourite movie of all time? It changes, but the constant is Dances With Wolves.""

sports	Mallory Franklin: GB's most successful female canoeist still driven by career ambition	"Great Britain's most successful female canoeist of all time says she is still hungry for success.
Mallory Franklin won silver at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and is a five-time World and seven-time European champion.
""100 per cent I still enjoy waking up everyday and knowing that I'm going to work on the water,"" she told BBC Radio Berkshire.
""Even when it's cold and ice is forming on my helmet, it's about having fun, learning and making the most of it.""
28-year-old from Windsor has had another successful season and recently claimed a gold and two silver medals at the ICF Canoe Slalom World Cup Final in Spain.
She topped the podium in the extreme kayak event - one of the new additions to the Olympic Games programme for Paris 2024 - to be crowned the World Cup's overall champion in the discipline for 2022.
""Extreme slalom is similar to kayaking with a double ended paddle but the boats and format are quite different. 
""The poles down the course are inflatables and there's four of you racing down the course at the same time.
""It's more of a battle!""
Franklin is now preparing to take on the best athletes from around the UK in the British Slalom Open at the Lee Valley White Water Centre, which was built for the London 2012 Olympic Games.
""It's a world-class venue and most countries would consider it one of the best in the world,"" added Franklin.
""From a British canoeing perspective, the facilities and gym are really good, we have physiotherapy, performance analysis, good controllable water that is pumped so we can move the course around. The whole of Lee Valley is a great environment for training.""
Olympic silver medallist, who has been canoeing most of her life, has had a remarkable rise through the sport and admits her interest in it came as a bit of a fluke.
""I started paddling before I even started school.
""My brother was a little too active and his teachers encouraged my parents to find something for him to do, so we went to the local leisure centre in Windsor and tried swimming.
""But next door was the Windsor and District Canoe Club, and they were having an open day with a barbecue and all the boats out for people to try, for fun.
""I instantly took to it and never stopped - I think I've been canoeing for 23 years now!""
Franklin says her desire to keep improving is one of the biggest factors that has allowed her to stay at the top of her game for so long, but she admits success in the sport does not come without sacrifice.
""In those years that shape you, 12 and 13, when kids are having parties, I wasn't always invited because I wasn't really that social and I didn't go round people's houses after school because I was always training or away at the weekends - those were probably the biggest sacrifices when I was young. 
""As you get older it's more of a physical sacrifice because you put your body through a lot and there is the mental toll too, you have depressed and elated periods, all those emotions can be a strain. 
""Maybe if I had gone and had a more normal life I wouldn't have had that amount of stress. But I've grown a lot and I'm much stronger because of it.""
Franklin's haul of medals hang proudly on the wall in her living room as a constant reminder of her years of achievement and success in the sport. Only her Olympic silver medal is tucked away in a box somewhere safe.
She has thought about when she might retire. But it will not be before she completes her main goal, which she is still hungry to achieve before she calls time on her outstanding career.
""My biological clock is probably what will dictate my finish line in this sport. I want to have kids and I don't want to leave that too long. 
""But my overall goal is to be world number one. To be the best over a long period of time and over a set of races. I want to be the person who turns up to a race and is always expected to do well."""	/sport/canoeing/63063368
politics	Tory race to be next PM nears deadline with focus on Mordaunt	"Penny Mordaunt is under pressure to secure enough support to go head-to-head with frontrunner Rishi Sunak in the race to become the UK's next prime minister, after Boris Johnson withdrew.
former chancellor has by far the most declared backers among Tory MPs. 
Ms Mordaunt needs 100 MPs to back her before nominations close at 14:00 BST.
Her campaign claimed she had passed 90, with a spokesperson telling the BBC: ""For the sake of the party, it's important our members have their say.""
If Ms Mordaunt does reach 100 backers, the race could then go to an online ballot of Conservative Party members, with the winner of that being announced on Friday.
One of her backers, former cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom, said there was ""absolutely no chance that Penny will step down"" from the leadership contest.
But another MP who was supporting her, George Freeman, has urged Ms Mordaunt to drop out and back Mr Sunak in the interest of unity and stability, rather than go to a membership ballot.
Confirming he would be switching to vote for Mr Sunak, Mr Freeman told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""Given the urgency of the economic crisis we face… it is essential, I think, that we come together quickly and demonstrate stability and unity, and for that reason I don't see the advantage of taking another three or four days to choose which of Penny or Rishi gets the top job and which gets the second top job.""
Mr Johnson's announcement that he would not stand had already put pressure on Ms Mordaunt to stand aside, allowing Mr Sunak to take charge of the party without the need for a vote.
In a statement on Sunday, Mr Johnson - who stood down as prime minister only seven weeks ago - claimed he had enough support to stand but added that now was ""simply not the right time"".
Dogged by a series of scandals, he was replaced as prime minister by Liz Truss, who resigned last week after 45 days in office marked by political and economic turmoil.
Mr Johnson's abrupt withdrawal surprised many of his supporters, including Tory MP James Duddridge, who tweeted: ""Well that was unexpected. Off to bed!""
Other backers of Mr Johnson - including former cabinet minister Nadine Dorries - have suggested he was the only candidate who had a mandate to be prime minister and a general election looked unavoidable following his withdrawal.
With Mr Johnson out of the leadership race, several MPs have switched their nominations to the two remaining candidates.
Of the MPs who have gone public with who they are backing, 193 have supported Mr Sunak and 26 have supported Ms Mordaunt.
Paul Goodman, editor of Tory news website Conservative Home, suggested Ms Mordaunt should pull out ""for the good of the Conservative Party and the country"".
But Ms Mordaunt's campaign said she was ""speaking to colleagues from across the party"" and was ""in it to win it"".
Her team insisted she was within ""touching distance"" of getting enough backers, while Mr Sunak's team said they were taking nothing for granted.
Damian Green, a cabinet minister in Theresa May's government who is backing Ms Mordaunt, said her numbers were ""well above"" the published figure and she was ""confident of getting to 100 before the deadline"".
Mr Sunak is the firm favourite to replace Ms Truss as PM and could do so by as early as Monday afternoon if Ms Mordaunt fails to meet the benchmark. 
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who scrapped many of Ms Truss's major economic plans announced in September's mini-budget, has endorsed Mr Sunak.
So too have Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch, and former cabinet ministers Suella Braverman, Priti Patel and Michael Gove.
Whoever wins the race will be the UK's third prime minister in less than two months.
xt general election is not due to take place until at least 2024, after the Conservatives won a landslide majority in the last one in 2019.
Under the UK's parliamentary political system, the next prime minister is under no obligation to call an early general election.
But there are growing calls from opposition parties for an immediate election - with Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner noting that Mr Sunak has not given a public interview since the leadership process began.
SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford also said Tory MPs should put pressure on their next leader to immediately call a general election.
In his statement withdrawing from the contest, Mr Johnson said he was ""uniquely placed to avert"" a general election, which would be ""a further disastrous distraction"".
His supporter, Ms Dorries, said it would now be impossible to avoid a general election, taking aim at the remaining two candidates.
former culture secretary tweeted that Mr Sunak and Ms Mordaunt, ""despite requests from Boris, refused to unite, which would have made governing utterly impossible"".
Ms Johnson's former director of communications, Will Walden, said he thought Mr Sunak would now win the leadership contest, adding: ""I think that will probably lead to a general election.""
But Home Secretary Grant Shapps rejected the idea of an early election, insisting people voted for the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto.
""The 2019 manifesto is a document, if anything, that would be more adhered to by Rishi, if he becomes prime minister, than perhaps has been the case in the last couple of months,"" Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Ms Truss replaced Mr Johnson following a lengthy leadership campaign in the summer. She will become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history when she stands down."	/news/uk-politics-63370359
technology	Haworth: 'Imposing' phone mast for historic village refused	"A 5G phone mast will not be allowed to be built in a West Yorkshire village because it would add an ""imposing modern element.""
CK Hutchinson Networks submitted plans to Bradford Council for a 60ft (18m) mast on Vale Mill Road, Haworth.
But Bradford Council has rejected the application, saying it would have a ""deleterious impact on the living conditions of nearby residents"". 
It would be ""overbearing"" and would ""dominate the area"", the council said.
Proposals put forward by CK Hutchinson Networks said the mast would fill a 5G ""coverage hole"" in the village.
Haworth, Cross Roads and Stanbury Parish Council had initially opposed the plan, saying the location, on a residential street, was ""wholly inappropriate for such equipment.""
mpany argued the mast was needed to provide good 5G signal in Haworth, and said there were already other elements of street furniture such as lampposts on the street.
But planning officers said the proposal would add an ""imposing modern element which would be visually jarring and detrimental to the character of the area"".
Local Democracy Reporting Service said officers had acknowledged there was a ""coverage hole"" in the location and agreed the pole would have extended 5G service across the area.
However, they said the ""siting and appearance of the mast"" would cause ""unacceptable harm to the visual amenity of the locality.""

business	Greene King brewery five-day strike ends	"A five-day strike by 188 staff working for brewery giant Greene King has ended without a resolution to a pay dispute and with more action planned.
Walk-outs took place at sites in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk; Eastwood, Notts; and Abingdon, Oxon.
Unite said union members had rejected an offer of a 3% pay rise and one-off payment of £650, and more strikes were planned for 21-23 December.
Greene King said it was ""disappointed"" its offer had been rejected.
Unite said the pay offer was a substantial real-term wage cut, because of inflation.
Unite regional officer Mark Jaina said strike action was not something the union wanted.
""Nobody wants to willingly go out on strike and stand in the freezing cold for five days, eight hours a day, but that's the situation we've been put in,"" he said.
Mr Jaina said workers were ""sympathetic to the people that like their favourite tipple, but their wages are of paramount importance"".
A Greene King spokesperson said: ""We can assure customers that this week's industrial action has not caused significant disruption and pubs across the country continue receiving deliveries from us.
""We have received notice for further industrial action from the afternoon of Wednesday, 21 December until the end of Friday, 23 December, but the large majority of our Christmas deliveries will already be completed by this point and we will ensure any disruption to customers is kept to an absolute minimum. 
""We remain disappointed that the union encouraged its members to reject our offer and we've met regularly with members of Unite over the past few months and explained how we aim to be fair and consistent across our business, given the challenging wider economic environment currently.""

politics	MP Julian Knight accuses Tory party of denying right to fair hearing	"Julian Knight has accused the Conservative Party of denying him the right to a fair hearing, after he was suspended as a Tory MP following a report to police involving allegations of sexual assault.
Mr Knight said he was ""entirely innocent of any wrongdoing whatsoever"". 
In a letter to the party's chief whip, Simon Hart, Mr Knight strongly objected to the way he was named by the whip's office on Wednesday night, when they confirmed his suspension from the parliamentary Conservative party. 
He has demanded an ""immediate and unequivocal answer"" as to why he was suspended and publicly named. 
MP for Solihull said the whips - who are responsible for party discipline - must have known their actions would ""entirely prejudice"" any prospect of getting a fair hearing in any inquiry, court or disciplinary hearing. 
""By unilaterally and publicly suspending the whip you have stripped me of the rights to anonymity or a fair hearing in any judicial forum or, indeed, in the court of public opinion,"" he wrote. 
In the letter, posted on his Twitter account on Thursday, Mr Knight said he was making the statement after his name was linked with an ""apparently serious but entirely unspecified offence"". 
He said he was making his letter public ""in the interests of natural justice"" and has asked the chief whip does the same with this reply.
On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the chief whip said in a statement Mr Knight had been suspended as a Conservative MP after a complaint to the Metropolitan Police.
Mr Knight said he found out he had been suspended from the media, after the statement from the chief whip's office was released. 
He said no one from the whip's office spoke to him before his suspension and he had heard nothing from the police about ""any allegation apparently made against me"". 
BBC has been told the chief whip was in touch with Mr Knight on Wednesday night.
But when asked for a response to Mr Knight's position, the chief whip's office would not comment further given the police investigation. 
On Thursday, the Metropolitan Police said that on 28 October it had received allegations of sexual assault against unnamed victims reported to have taken place on unknown dates at undisclosed locations.
In his letter to the chief whip, Mr Knight asked whether his suspension was related to those allegations.
ment added: ""On 7 December, a further referral relating to the incident[s] was made and an investigation was launched.""
Police said inquiries were ongoing and there have been no arrests.
In a tweet earlier, Mr Knight said he believed his suspension was ""wrong and unjustified"". 
""Subsequently, I have received what my lawyers advise are explicit threats involving blackmail as well as being at the centre of a campaign of rumour and innuendo,"" he said.
""All matters are now with my lawyers and I will be recusing myself from Parliament until the matter is resolved.""

politics	Solar farms 'vital' part of renewable energy mix, say Norfolk campaigners	"Energy from the sun is a key part of the renewable energy mix but some think solar farms should not be built on farmland, BBC Politics East reports.
Recently the then Prime Minister Liz Truss suggested agricultural land used for food should not be used for solar power. 
But environmentalists have told the BBC that solar farms are vital to reduce carbon emissions.
A 200-acre (81-hectare) scheme has been approved at Bloy's Grove near Norwich.
r farm off Brick Kiln Lane, between Mulbarton, Newton Flotman and Swainsthorpe, is expected to generate enough energy to power 14,000 homes.
Ann Chandler, of Swainsthorpe Parish Council, said: ""The land [at Bloy's Grove] has been used for growing crops for hundreds and hundreds of years, so we are extremely worried about it and upset about it. 
""It's not good for our future food security. We've been told we need our food security to be self-sufficient. 
""In France they are putting solar panels high above their car parks, such as supermarket car parks.
""We should think outside the box a bit more and not use our prime land.""
EDF renewables, owned by the French state - which is behind the project, is currently building two other solar farms in the region with more in the pipeline.
Ben Fawcett, the firm's head of solar, said: ""Farmers get a guaranteed income. If they know they can get a secure income, that also allows them to invest which potentially means their other land becomes more productive. 
""So I don't think it is necessarily a direct conflict between food security and energy security and I think the Ukraine crisis has reminded us of the importance of energy security."" 
Current government policy on solar generation is unclear. 
Six months ago a target to increase it five-fold was announced, then last month the then PM and South West Norfolk MP Ms Truss appeared to move away from solar farms.
""I very much support the use of solar panels on commercial buildings - I thinks that's great - and on homes,"" she said.
""But what we shouldn't be doing is using productive agricultural land, that could be producing food, for solar energy.""
Michael Rayner, Norfolk spokesman the countryside charity CPRE, said solar farms were ""a quick fix"" leading to ""quick profits"", but not the answer to providing solar power.
""In 2014, there was a report that showed there were 250,000 hectares of commercial south-facing roof-space where we could put solar and that doesn't include domestic roof space or brownfield [urban] land,"" he said.
Asher Minns, the executive directive of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, based at the University of East Anglia, said the land taken up by solar farms was a quarter of that used by golf courses. 
""We need solar on land and... on roofs and new-build roofs and new-build businesses,"" he said.
""There have to be proper building requirements that if you are building a new building you need to put solar panels on the roof. We need clean electricity going into the 21st Century.""
A Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesman said: ""Protecting our environment, backing British farmers and delivering long-term energy security with more renewables is at the heart of the government's manifesto.
""We will be working closely with farmers, land managers and environmental groups as we look at ways to improve our future farming policy so that it...  supports our thriving food and farming sector.""

politics	IMF openly criticises UK government tax plans	"International Monetary Fund has openly criticised the UK government over its plan for tax cuts, warning that the measures are likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis.
In an unusually outspoken statement, the IMF said the proposal was likely to increase inequality and add to pressures pushing up prices.
Markets have already raised alarm over the plans, sending the pound plunging. 
government says the measures will kickstart economic growth.
On Wednesday morning, sterling fell by 0.7% to $1.06 after the IMF raised its concerns. It comes after the currency hit a record low of around $1.03 on Monday.
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled the country's biggest tax package in 50 years on Friday. But the £45bn cut has sparked fears that government borrowing could surge along with interest rates.
IMF works to stabilise the global economy and one of its key roles is to act as an early economic warning system.
It said it understood the package aimed to boost growth, but it warned that the cuts could speed up the pace of price rises, which the UK's central bank is trying to bring down.
""Furthermore, the nature of the UK measures will likely increase inequality,"" it said.
IMF said that the government publishing a fiscal plan on 23 November gave it an opportunity to ""re-evaluate"" tax measures, ""especially those that benefit high income earners"".
UK government proposals would scrap the top rate of income tax, and end a cap on bankers' bonuses, among other measures.
uncement on Friday sparked days of financial turmoil, as investors dumped the pound and UK debt. Some of the country's biggest lenders also suspended mortgage deals amid the uncertainty.
reasury said: ""We are focused on growing the economy to raise living standards for everyone.""
It added that Mr Kwarteng was due to publish his medium-term plan for the economy on 23 November, which would include ensuring that UK debt falls as a share of economic output in the medium term.
Meanwhile, Lord Frost, the former Brexit minister and close ally of Prime Minister Liz Truss, criticised the IMF's statement.
He told the Daily Telegraph: ""The IMF has consistently advocated highly conventional economic policies. It is following this approach that has produced years of slow growth and weak productivity. 
""The only way forward for Britain is lower taxes, spending restraint, and significant economic reform.""
BBC economics editor Faisal Islam says the IMF's ""stinging rebuke... reflected similar concerns from the world's major finance ministries that a crisis brewing in the UK could spill over into a global slowdown"".
Adnan Mazarei, a former deputy director at the IMF, said it was common for the foundation to make strong statements on ""emerging market countries with problematic policies but not often G7 countries"".
He said it showed the IMF was worried that tax cuts were permanent and that the budget would have to be financed by more borrowing. It was also concerned about inflation rising which would require interest rate increases by the Bank of England.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""the fear"" was the Bank of England and the Treasury were not working together properly for the benefit of the UK economy.
He said: ""There is also a sense of problems in the country's economic management and their ability to handle issues, which could lead to problems of inflation [and] financial market difficulties... for example we've seen problems in the mortgage markets which will hurt the UK household.""
On Tuesday, the Bank of England signalled that it was prepared to ramp up interest rates in response to the slump in the value of the pound.
Its chief economist Huw Pill said the Bank ""cannot be indifferent"" to the developments of the past days.
He said the Bank would have to deliver a ""significant monetary policy response"" to protect sterling.
Speaking to BBC Two's Newsnight, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers described the situation facing the UK as ""very ominous"". 
""I can't in all honesty remember a time when a set of policy announcements from a G7 country elicited so negative a response both from markets and from economic experts,"" he said.
""When a country sees its interest rates rise by [as much as they have] in two days at the same time that its currency is falling in a major way, that is a sign that there has been a major loss of market credibility and market confidence.
""The kind of warning that Britain received from the IMF today is a kind of warning that comes much more frequently to emerging markets with new governments than to a country like Britain.""
Asked about the UK's plans at an event in Washington, White House economic adviser Brian Deese said he had not been surprised by the negative reaction of the markets and that it was important to focus on ""fiscal prudence, fiscal discipline"", the Reuters news agency reported.
Moody's credit rating agency said on Wednesday that the UK's plan for ""large unfunded tax cuts"" was ""credit negative"" and would lead to higher, persistent deficits ""amid rising borrowing costs [and] a weaker growth outlook"". Moody's did not change the UK's credit rating.
Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government must ""urgently lay out how it will fix the problems it created through its reckless decisions to waste money in an untargeted cut in the top rate of tax"".
""Waiting until November [when the fiscal plan is published] is not an option,"" she said. Instead, ""the government must urgently review the plans made in their fiscal statement last week"".
She added: ""This statement from the IMF should set alarm bells ringing in government and make it clear that they need to act now.""
xceptionally blunt warning from the IMF, indicating that Kwasi Kwarteng's £45bn mini-Budget spree may not only have been ill-judged and risks sharper rate rises - but could also increase income inequality. 
How likely is the latter?
russ government's growth plan centres on tax cuts for the better off, in the hope it will benefit wider society by boosting investment, innovation and job creation. 
But a 2020 study by academics at the London School of Economics examined the impact of such policies in wealthy countries over five decades - and found they failed to significantly boost growth or jobs. They were more likely, the study claimed,  to widen the gap between rich and poor.
At the very start of the Conservative leadership campaign, a top IMF official told me large-scale universal tax cuts in the UK would be a ""mistake"" . 
Instead, as the energy price crisis has intensified, it's been calling for measures that are targeted towards the least well-off. And it's openly urging the government to focus on that when the Chancellor reveals the next instalment of his plans in November.  
re's little indication so far those calls will be heeded. 
""We are closely monitoring recent economic developments in the UK and are engaged with the authorities.  
""We understand that the sizable fiscal package announced aims at helping families and businesses deal with the energy shock and at boosting growth via tax cuts and supply measures. 
""However, given elevated inflation pressures in many countries, including the UK, we do not recommend large and untargeted fiscal packages at this juncture, as it is important that fiscal policy does not work at cross purposes to monetary policy. 
""Furthermore, the nature of the UK measures will likely increase inequality. 
""The November 23 budget will present an early opportunity for the UK government to consider ways to provide support that is more targeted and re evaluate the tax measures, especially those that benefit high income earners.""

entertainment	Rare Jane Austen books could sell for £100,000	"A set of five first-edition Jane Austen novels could sell for more than £100,000 at auction. 
ks were bought by a UK-based private collector in the 1970s and 1980s for about £5,000.
re now due to be sold at auction in Gloucestershire by the daughter of the collector.
rarest of the five books is Sense and Sensibility as fewer than 1,000 were printed when it was first published anonymously in 1811.
Chris Albury, auctioneer and senior valuer at Dominic Winter Auctions in Cirencester, said: ""The current owner remembers her mother being particularly anxious one time after she had bought one of the books for £2,000 and told her husband to cancel the cheque that night.
""He wisely, in a long-term investment sense, said no. 
""She was a great fan of Jane Austen but these were the only rare books she ever bought and they would be brought out every now and then, treated carefully by the family, and then put back in the bookcase.
""We estimate she would have paid no more than £5,000 for all of these back then and they are now expected to fetch over £100,000.
""The daughter has had these for many years now and has decided to sell them through auction and let others get the pleasure from them and use the money for new projects and plans.""
Also being sold is a copy of Pride and Prejudice, which was published in 1813 in an edition of approximately 1,500 copies.
Mansfield Park was released the following year and Emma was published in 1816 - each in editions of 1,250 copies.
Finally, published a year after Austen's death in 1817, came Northanger Abbey and Persuasion in a run of 1,750 copies.
""The first four were published in triple decker format, three-volume sets that became standard practice for novels put out by British publishers in the 19th Century - cleverly forcing the new breed of fiction readers to pay for each novel three times,"" Mr Albury said.
He said first copies of Pride and Prejudice were the most sought-after by collectors, while Sense and Sensibility was valuable because of its rarity.
Mr Albury said interest in the auction, on 15 December, had come from transatlantic book dealers and ""seasoned Austen collectors looking to fill gaps in their collections"".

health	Yorkshire ambulance bosses declare critical incident amid delays	"Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) has declared a critical incident as soaring demand sees people face ""significant delays"" waiting for ambulances.
People are being urged to only call 999 in life-threatening emergencies.
move comes as nurses in West Yorkshire hold their second day of industrial action, and the day before ambulance staff are set to go out on strike in England and Wales over pay.
Ambulances have also faced long delays handing over patients at hospitals.
In a statement, YAS said declaring a critical incident would allow it to ""protect our core services for patients and respond to ongoing demand"".
rvice across the country is likely to be hit by major disruption as ambulance workers, including paramedics, control room workers and technicians walk out in England and Wales on Wednesday. 
More than 4,000 ambulance workers are expected to walk out in Yorkshire in the ongoing pay dispute.
YAS executive director Nick Smith said: ""Services will be severely disrupted, with the likelihood of significant delays.  
""So, we are urging the public to use the emergency ambulance service more wisely and only to call 999 when someone is in a life-threatening or very serious condition as we prioritise our response to those most in need.""
Although ambulances will still respond to life-threatening emergencies, other calls will not be answered and people could be asked to make their own way to hospital.
Health service bosses from the NHS Confederation have already said they ""cannot guarantee patient safety"" during the ambulance workers' strike, while Health Minister Will Quince has told people to avoid contact sports and other ""risky activities"" during the strike.

business	Low-deposit mortgage scheme extended for a year	"A mortgage guarantee scheme to help people get on the property ladder is to be extended by a year.
government said the programme, which was due to close at the end of December, would help buyers ""navigate difficult times"".
It was originally designed to encourage lenders to give home loans to people offering a 5% deposit - a product that was far less available during Covid.
Some lenders still play it safe as buyers face the rising cost of living.
Chief Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""For hard-working families facing today's challenging economic conditions, it is right that we continue to help them secure their first home or move into their dream house.
""Extending this scheme means thousands more have the chance to benefit, and supports the market as we navigate through these difficult times.""
mortgage scheme has a £600,000 limit, and is primarily used to help first-time buyers.
95% loan-to-value mortgages are often seen as riskier by banks as they are more vulnerable to falling property prices, when there is a risk that people hold more debt than their home is worth.
Under the scheme, the government takes on some of the risk and compensates the lender for some of the loan if the property is repossessed.
It began in April last year, and the government said it had helped more than 24,000 households.
Some brokers have suggested the scheme had done its job by bringing more low-deposit mortgages onto the market, but others suggested only a small number of lenders had used the scheme.
Many mortgage providers generally only lend to those with a regular income, irrespective of any government incentive, and still carry out affordability checks.
Unemployment levels are expected to rise and the UK housing market is expected to slow. 
A recent survey by the Building Societies Association, suggested that 14% of people thought now was a good time to buy a property, but 47% did not think now was a good time to purchase a home."	/news/business-64031563

Maple Healthcare in Lisnaskea is one of Northern Ireland's largest GP practices.
managers have handed their contract back to the Department of Health, meaning the practice requires a change in how it operates or who operates it.
It will continue seeing patients as normal for the next six months.
Department of Health has said it will start a recruitment process to find new operators for the practice.
umber of partners at Maple Healthcare has reduced over the past 18 months, while another is due to retire in early 2023. 
It is understood one option would be for the Western Trust to take on the management of the practice. 
In recent years, the surgery had stepped in to provide services when neighbouring GPs retired. 
Maple Healthcare taking over the patients of three practices in Roslea, Newtownbutler and Lisnaskea.
In a statement, the management of Maple Healthcare said media reports over the weekend of the practice's potential closure had caused ""anxiety and uncertainty"".
""We would like to reassure all our staff and patients that we are continuing to provide GP care and services and we remain committed to the community in Lisnaskea, Newtownbutler and Roslea,"" they said.
ment added the changes in partners and a ""failure to recruit sufficient new partners"" led to management exploring with the department how ""GP services can continue to be delivered locally over the years ahead"".
ment said that the partners at the practice wanted to be released from administrative tasks to have ""more time to devote to patient care"".
""We would like to clarify that rather than a 'change in management' which was erroneously reported over the weekend, what we seek is a change in employment and contractor status,"" the statement added.
It added that the partners intend to continue to work in Lisnaskea and Newtownbuter and continue to deliver services.
""We hope that whatever agreement is reached with the department, it will safeguard GP services within our community for the foreseeable future,"" it said.
ment went on to say that the transfer of ownership is expected to take six months and that patients were urged to stay with the practice ""as we intend to provide a seamless transfer to a new provider"".
In their letter to the Department of Health, the partners cited ""excessive stresses and intolerable pressures"" at work as some of the reasons for handing back the contract. 
""The remaining partners find it inconceivable that they could continue to carry the burden of responsibility of running the practice,"" they added.
w came days after the Western Trust confirmed plans to temporarily remove emergency surgery services from the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen. 
On Saturday, Dr Alan Stout, co-chairman of the British Medical Association GP committee, said there was a well-known problem with recruiting new GPs in the area.

US clothing brand has advertised a new collection ""with graffiti by Banksy"".
mpany said the collection was created in collaboration with Brandalised, which licenses designs by graffiti artists.
After the artist posted his message encouraging shoplifting, a criminal offence, Guess closed the store to the public, placed security outside and covered up the window display. Staff in the shop declined to speak to the BBC.
Speaking last month about the collection, Guess chief creative officer Paul Marciano said: ""The graffiti of Banksy has had a phenomenal influence that resonates throughout popular culture.
""This new capsule collection with Brandalised is a way for fashion to show its gratitude.""
Copyright lawyer Liz Ward, founder of Virtuoso Legal, said Guess ""appear to have legitimately sourced the Banksy artwork via a third party, namely Brandalised, who say they have rights to commercialise and use Banksy's artwork on goods"".
She said: ""It isn't known if Banksy approved or even knew about this deal. If he did know about it, then perhaps his comments are there to create some kind of guerrilla marketing campaign. If he didn't know about it, then he must be quite annoyed, especially as such mainstream companies and brands don't accord with his anti-establishment views.
""The short point is that Banksy should be pursing Brandalised and or Guess for infringement of his work. However, given she/he wants to remain anonymous, that may well be impossible.""
Copyright infringement is ""extremely serious and can cause long term commercial damage"", but is normally a civil offence, she added - whereas shoplifting is a criminal offence. 
""Whatever the rights and wrongs of this, it isn't right to encourage shoplifting per se.""
Banksy's representatives declined to comment further, while Brandalised has also not commented.
Earlier this week, Banksy won an appeal to allow him to keep the trademark of one of his most famous images, a monkey wearing a sandwich board, at the EU Intellectual Property Office.
He also revealed on Thursday that he had visited Ukraine to create seven new pieces.
His artwork included a woman in rollers and a gas mask holding a fire extinguisher, and a Vladimir Putin lookalike being thrown to the floor by a child in a judo match. "	/news/entertainment-arts-63682298

Mr Sunak will become the fifth Tory prime minister in six years.
Nominations
Under the rules of the latest leadership contest, candidates needed to have the support of at least 100 Conservative MPs (not including themselves).
Rishi Sunak was the only one to reach that level and so became the party leader.
As there are currently 357 Tory MPs, a maximum of three candidates could have met the threshold.
r contenders - Boris Johnson and Penny Mordaunt - both withdrew from the process.
Vote among Tory MPs
If more than one candidate had gained 100 nominations, there would have been a vote among Conservative MPs. 
If there had been two candidates in that ballot, it would have been indicative. This means it would have shown who had the most support among MPs.
If there had been three candidates, the one with the fewest votes would have been eliminated, before an indicative vote would have been held.

If two candidates had remained at the end of the ballots, members of the Conservative Party would have decided on the next leader and prime minister.

A second instalment of £324 will be transferred in the autumn.
gether, they are the largest in a package of payments from the government designed to help with rising prices, and specifically soaring energy bills. Even so, recipients can spend or save the money as they see fit. 
A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We are on track to process the first instalment by the end of July.
""All eligible households will automatically receive the first instalment, and no one needs to worry they will miss out.
""There will be a few unique cases - such as those who were not initially entitled but have gained entitlement upon appeal - who will be paid after July, as soon as possible.""
Financial commentators say these payments will ease, but not cure, the financial strain families face this winter.
""It is a vital step in the right direction for those on lower incomes, but it is a small step back from the precipice after millions of people have edged ever-closer over the past few months,"" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown.
""It is a positive step for those on the lowest earnings, who have been hit three times harder than higher earners by rising prices. However, it is not enough to put people back where they were before price hikes.""

112 mile-long (180km) power line would run from Norwich, in Norfolk, to Tilbury, in Essex.
Charles Banner QC said there were ""legal deficiencies"" with the consultation.
National Grid said it was ""listening carefully to the views"" of the public.
It said it felt the proposals met its regulatory obligations to the government, which has a target to connect up to 50 GW of offshore wind by 2030.
Meanwhile, South Norfolk Council accused National Grid of acting like ""no-one lives in Norfolk"".
Councillors said the utilities company had failed to provide enough information about its proposals to locals.
It comes after Norfolk County Council announced it was against the scheme, which has also faced opposition from three Suffolk councils, six East Anglian MPs and campaign groups.
Mr Banner, a barrister employed by campaigners against the plans, said: ""The lay public consultees have not been provided with anything approaching a sufficient level of information to enable them to make an intelligent comparison of the environmental impacts of the preferred option compared to options which involve no, or considerably fewer, pylons.""
He added: ""If left uncorrected these legal deficiencies will infect the later statutory consultation.""
re part of a proposed 400kV electricity transmission line between Norwich and a new Bramford substation near Ipswich, and then to Tilbury in south Essex, called the East Anglia Green Energy Enablement project.
National Grid said the line was needed to carry electricity from offshore wind turbines.
It has proposed to run the cables underground through the Dedham Vale area of outstanding natural beauty on the Essex/Suffolk border, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
ree Essex councils - the county council, Braintree District and Brentwood Borough - have this week also indicated their opposition to a new power line that would cut through countryside in their districts.
Lesley Wagland OBE, Essex County Council cabinet member for infrastructure, said: ""We believe that new offshore generated electricity should be transmitted offshore, which is why we need an offshore grid.
""Such an alternative approach could avoid all the physical constraints of an above or below-ground solution.""
National Grid said it would take people's comments into consideration as it developed the proposals, and there would be another opportunity to comment on the proposals before an application is submitted to the Planning Inspectorate in late 2024.

ultants - who sit on the Review of General Surgery Network - come from Northern Ireland's five health trusts.
f three surgeons in December and failure to recruit more led to the decision.
It added that a 2016 health reform report had been ignored. 
withdraw emergency services from 18 December at the Enniskillen hospital was announced by the Western Trust on Thursday..
rust said the move was necessary to protect the public's safety after it had problems recruiting surgical staff.
It added that the emergency department and other services, including obstetrics, will continue to operate as normal.
reated an immediate backlash, with local groups and politicians expressing outrage and devastation over the move. 
Many said they are concerned that the road infrastructure does not support a quick transfer of patients from Enniskillen to Altnagelvin, Craigavon or hospitals in Belfast. 
Emergency general surgery relates to the treatment of patients with conditions such as acute abdominal pain, infections, bleeding and trauma. 
It includes operations such as removing a patient's gall bladder, appendix or part of the bowel. 
In a statement on Monday, the surgeons said they recognised and understood the support in the local community for their hospital. 
However, they said there were many cases in which emergency care already bypasses the SWAH - for instance heart attack patients requiring stents or those who have suffered major trauma go to hospitals in Londonderry or Belfast.

: ""It is unavoidable fact that smaller hospitals are finding it difficult to recruit and retain consultant general surgeons.
""Emergency general surgery requires 24/7 consultant cover.
""When you have smaller teams, rota are more punishing as they are shared out among fewer colleagues.
""The service invariably ends up being reliant on temporary locum doctors to plug gaps that cannot be filled permanently.""

""In short, the service becomes less resilient, more fragile and less attractive as a workplace,"" it added.

health	Covid: Wales autumn vaccine boosters hit a million	"utumn booster programme for Covid vaccinations has passed the one million mark in Wales.
w stands at 1,023,594 boosters given out, according to the latest Public Health Wales figures.
But smaller proportions of key groups have been reached than earlier phases of the vaccine programme, which started two years ago this week.
Just under 78% of the over-65s have had the autumn booster and more than 86% of care home residents.
rs started being rolled out in September and around 8,300 doses are still being given out a day.
Around half of people in their 50s and early 60s have now been reached.
But this is far fewer than those who took up earlier doses of the vaccine.
Similar trends can be seen in other key groups, apart from care home residents, who have still been reached in high numbers.
So far, only just over half of healthcare workers have taken up the autumn booster offer.
re are also still more than 15,000 people - 30% - of people with a weakened immune system who have not taken up a booster yet.
Public health officials have admitted challenges in persuading people to take boosters this time round, with lives returning to normal and many people also having had the virus.
most recent infection survey from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests 95.9% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.
Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the vaccine programme meant far fewer cases of Covid were expected this winter.
""But we are not fully immune to the virus and we must keep our defences up,"" she said. ""Covid-19 and flu remain a threat, especially to older people and people with other health conditions.""
Wales has reached more of those in key groups than England with autumn boosters, although in a similar trend to earlier phases of the vaccine programme it is behind Scotland.
Meanwhile, figures for the flu vaccine programme, which has been run in parallel, shows similar uptake in older groups compared to the same point as last year.
But only a third of two and three-year-olds have had a flu vaccine so far, compared to more than 38% at the same point in 2021.
It was lowest in the Cardiff and Vale health board area, with less than 28% of children aged two and three being given a dose.
Only a third of NHS staff have also taken up a flu vaccine, compared to about 46% at the same point last year.
Dr Sir Frank Atherton, chief medical officer for Wales, urged people to take advantage of walk-in appointments - and for those who had not received an appointment to check with their health board.
""It's important to remember that Covid-19 has not gone away. Vaccination is still important for those in priority groups and remains our best form of defence against the virus.""
Dr Chris Johnson, interim head of the vaccine programme at Public Health Wales, said it was ""promising"" so many people had come forward for Covid boosters.
""It is vital that people take up the offer of their Covid-19 booster and their annual flu vaccine when they receive their invitation, so that we can continue to protect the NHS this winter,"" he said.
figures in Wales come as NHS England has urged people with weakened immune systems to take up boosters, with a third eligible still not coming forward there.
Douglas Twenefour, head of care at Diabetes UK, described vaccines as ""the safest, most effective way of protecting us from coronavirus and flu"", adding: ""People with diabetes have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if they get coronavirus.

Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget of sweeping tax cuts would ""reward the already wealthy"" and not boost economic growth, Labour has said.
Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the plan was a Tory ""admission of 12 years of economic failure"".
measures were funded by unnecessary borrowing instead of a windfall tax on oil and gas firms, she added.
Mr Kwarteng spent billions on policies he said would shake up the UK's finances and boost economic growth.
In a statement to Parliament, Mr Kwarteng abolished the top rate of income tax for the highest earners as he unveiled the biggest package of tax cuts for decades.
His announcements included scrapping a cap on bankers' bonuses, reversing a rise in National Insurance and cutting stamp duty tax - a property purchasing tax - for some buyers.
Institute of Fiscal Studies said the richest 10% of households would gain the most from Mr Kwarteng's measures, which undo the tax rises introduced by his predecessor, Rishi Sunak.
rsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said those earning £1m annually will get a £55,000 tax cut next year.
As the UK faces a recession, rising interest rates and soaring energy bills, Ms Reeves said ""the Conservatives are the cost-of-living crisis"".
But Mr Kwarteng argued his economic vision will ""turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth"".
Liberal Democrats said the chancellor's plan was ""a recipe for disaster that will leave families suffering from soaring prices while banks and oil and gas companies rake in huge profits"".
Scottish National Party said the Tory government was ""robbing the poor to pay the rich"" and its measures do not go far enough to help people on low incomes.
Mr Kwarteng told MPs he was fulfilling new Prime Minister Liz Truss's promise to run a ""tax-cutting government"".
""For too long in this country, we have indulged in a fight over redistribution. Now, we need to focus on growth, not just how we tax and spend,"" he said in his statement.
In her response, Ms Reeves congratulated the chancellor ""on his comprehensive demolition"" of the Conservative government's record of the past 12 years. 
""Their record, their failure, their vicious circle of stagnation,"" she added.
Ms Reeves said borrowing was higher than it needed to be after the Bank of England raised interest rates and warned the UK may already be in recession. ""This is casino economics - gambling the mortgages and finances of every family in the country to keep the Tory party happy,"" Ms Reeves said.
She criticised the chancellor for refusing to release an independent forecast of how his tax changes would impact the economy, as the government usually does when it delivers major financial statements.
But because Mr Kwarteng's statement was not technically a budget, he said he would release this forecast ""in due course"" before the end of the year.
Ms Reeves said without this forecast, the chancellor's statement was ""a budget without figures, a menu without prices"", asking what he had to hide.
She referenced a tweet by US President Joe Biden, saying he was right to be ""sick and tired"" of ""tickle-down economics"", which was a ""discredited"" theory that would not ""unleash the wave of investment that we need"".
She said: ""The chancellor has made clear who his priorities are today - not a plan for growth, a plan to reward the already wealthy.
""A return to the trickle-down of the past, back to the future, not a brave new era."""	/news/uk-politics-63007423
politics	Chris Mason: Asylum backlog is complex issue to resolve	"For as long as Rishi Sunak has been prime minister, whenever I've spoken to him or his senior team, the issue of small boat crossings has often been mentioned.
Before the Autumn Statement, the budget in all but name last month, I was told the prime minister was devoting more time to it than anything else but the statement. 
Quite something, given the range of issues that cross a prime minister's desk.
government is desperate to get a grip on what Home Secretary Suella Braverman has said has been a failure to control the UK's borders. 
want to cut the numbers crossing the Channel in small boats.
want to deport asylum seekers whose claims are rejected much more quickly.
And they want to house asylum seekers whose cases are being worked on more cheaply.
Why? 
Because they have concluded it's a big deal for millions of people, and, having candidly pointed out the failure of Conservative governments over the last 12 years to sort it out, or even adequately manage it, they now need to show they are up for it. 
Let's be blunt: this is an incredibly difficult and complex issue to resolve, whatever resolution even means on this. 
ke a look at this from more than 20 years ago, when Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett was promising a crackdown, including making the asylum process quicker. 
wo decades later, Mr Sunak is promising exactly the same. How the issue presents itself varies.
Back then it was about the Red Cross refugee camp at Sangatte near Calais and migrants trying to cross by climbing into the back of lorries or get through the Channel Tunnel.
Now, it is small boats and a particular influx from Albania.
In a world where you're only a smartphone scroll away from knowing how rich some places are compared to home, let alone if you're also fleeing persecution, the lure of a country like the UK will always be there.
But let's unpack what the prime minister is promising.
Firstly, that issue that has dogged successive governments: making the asylum process quicker.
Mr Sunak said ""we expect to abolish the backlog of initial asylum decisions by the end of next year"". But when he said ""abolish the backlog"" he didn't mean all of the backlog.
Downing Street later acknowledged this meant making an initial decision in all cases that were outstanding at the end of June this year, when the system for processing cases was changed.
What happened at the end of June was the Nationality and Borders Act became law.
Since then it has been an offence to arrive on the shores of the UK without permission and so officials are now able to differentiate claims depending on whether people arrived through legal or illegal routes. 
What ministers are actually committing to is clearing the backlog of 92,601 initial asylum decisions relating to cases made in June of this year or earlier.
As of September this year, there were around 117,000 unresolved asylum cases awaiting a decision, relating to around 143,000 people (a case can relate to more than one person because of families).
So that is around 24,000 cases that could still be unresolved in a year's time, on top of additional cases between now and then, that wouldn't count against the prime minister's definition of abolishing the backlog.
And as he acknowledged to me when I interviewed him, reaching an initial decision is often not the end of the matter, because people can appeal ""and we're not in control of the pace of those appeals"". 
Mr Sunak is also promising a new law ""to make unambiguously clear that if you enter the UK illegally you should not be able to remain here"". 
But what isn't clear is whether he would contemplate the UK leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, or be willing to ignore any adverse rulings from its court.
And one other thing in the package of ideas that caught my eye: the government's promise to cut in half the current cost of housing asylum seekers, often currently in hotels.
urrent approach currently runs up a bill of £5.5m a day.
Instead, Mr Sunak wants people to be housed in disused military facilities, old holiday parks and former student digs.
But when I asked him where, he couldn't tell me, saying I wouldn't expect him ""to comment on commercial negotiations"".  
I wouldn't - but if such negotiations are still ongoing, it's not nailed down that the necessary alternative accommodation will be available.
And that's before the huge political rows about the sites that are chosen, when there is a very good chance of strong local opposition.
So what about Labour's approach to all this, as they seek to present themselves as an alternative government?
Leader Sir Keir Starmer pointed to what he sees as persistent Tory failure on the issue, as well as what he called the ""unworkable gimmicks"" that ministers have suggested and remain committed to, such as deporting some asylum seekers to Rwanda.
But his response was notably short and he himself will want to appear robust on the issue, given how much it matters to so many people, particularly in seats Labour needs to win back to form a government.
rime minister and his successors, whoever they are, will continue to wrestle with asylum and illegal immigration.
It's a challenge history suggests governments can only ever hope to manage, rather than solve."	/news/uk-politics-63966778
technology	TikTok profits from livestreams of families begging	"WATCH: Mona Ali Al-Karim says she and her daughters beg for money to pay for hospital treatment
Displaced families in Syrian camps are begging for donations on TikTok while the company takes up to 70% of the proceeds, a BBC investigation found.
Children are livestreaming on the social media app for hours, pleading for digital gifts with a cash value.
BBC saw streams earning up to $1,000 (£900) an hour, but found the people in the camps received only a tiny fraction of that.
kTok said it would take prompt action against ""exploitative begging"".
mpany said this type of content was not allowed on its platform, and it said its commission from digital gifts was significantly less than 70%. But it declined to confirm the exact amount.
Earlier this year, TikTok users saw their feeds fill with livestreams of families in Syrian camps, drawing support from some viewers and concerns about scams from others.
In the camps in north-west Syria, the BBC found that the trend was being facilitated by so-called ""TikTok middlemen"", who provided families with the phones and equipment to go live.
middlemen said they worked with agencies affiliated to TikTok in China and the Middle East, who gave the families access to TikTok accounts. These agencies are part of TikTok's global strategy to recruit livestreamers and encourage users to spend more time on the app.
Since the TikTok algorithm suggests content based on the geographic origin of a user's phone number, the middlemen said they prefer to use British SIM cards. They say people from the UK are the most generous gifters. 
Mona Ali Al-Karim and her six daughters are among the families who go live on TikTok every day, sitting on the floor of their tent for hours, repeating the few English phrases they know: ""Please like, please share, please gift.""
Mona's husband was killed in an airstrike and she is using the livestreams to raise money for an operation for her daughter Sharifa, who is blind.
gifts they're asking for are virtual, but they cost the viewers real money and can be withdrawn from the app as cash. Livestream viewers send the gifts - ranging from digital roses, costing a few cents, to virtual lions costing around $500 - to reward or tip creators for content.
For five months, the BBC followed 30 TikTok accounts broadcasting live from Syrian camps for displaced people and built a computer program to scrape information from them, showing that viewers were often donating digital gifts worth up to $1,000 an hour to each account.
Families in the camps said they were receiving only a tiny fraction of these sums, however.
With TikTok declining to say how much it takes from gifts, the BBC ran an experiment to track where the money goes.
A reporter in Syria contacted one of the TikTok-affiliated agencies saying he was living in the camps. He obtained an account and went live, while BBC staff in London sent TikTok gifts worth $106 from another account.
At the end of the livestream, the balance of the Syrian test account was $33. TikTok had taken 69% of the value of the gifts.
kTok influencer and ex-professional rugby player Keith Mason donated £300 ($330) during one family's livestream and encouraged his nearly one million followers to do the same.
When told by the BBC that most of these funds were taken by the social media company, he said it was ""ridiculous"" and ""unfair"" to families in Syria. 
""You've got to have some transparency. To me, that's very greedy. It's greed,"" he said.
$33 remaining from the BBC's $106 gift was reduced by a further 10% when it was withdrawn from the local money transfer shop. TikTok middlemen would take 35% of the remainder, leaving a family with just $19.
Hamid, one of the TikTok middlemen in the camps, told the BBC he had sold his livestock to pay for a mobile phone, SIM card and wi-fi connection to work with families on TikTok.
He now broadcasts with 12 different families, for several hours a day.
Hamid said he uses TikTok to help families make a living. He pays them most of the profits, minus his running costs, he said.
Like the other middlemen, Hamid said he was supported by ""live agencies"" in China, who work directly with TikTok.
""They help us if we have any problems with the app. They unlock blocked accounts. We give them the name of the page, the profile picture, and they open the account,"" Hamid said.
Hamid helps families go on TikTok live. Watch how the BBC investigated TikTok's commission from digital gifts
Agencies like these, known as ""livestreaming guilds"" and based all around the world, are contracted by TikTok to help content creators produce more appealing livestreams. 
kTok pays them a commission according to the duration of livestreams and the value of gifts received, the agencies told the BBC. 
mphasis on duration means TikTokers, including children in the Syrian camps, go live for hours at a time.
Marwa Fatafta, from digital rights organisation Access Now, says these livestreams run contrary to TikTok's own policies to ""prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation"" of minors on the platform.
kTok Begging in Syria
BBC News investigates a new trend on TikTok - hundreds of families in camps for displaced people in Syria, begging for gifts on TikTok livestreams.
Watch on BBC News Channel Sunday 02:30 or on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)
""TikTok clearly states that users are not allowed to explicitly solicit gifts, so this is a clear violation of their own terms of services, as well as the rights of these people,"" she said.
She acknowledges that people have the right to share their stories online ""to try to seek support and sympathy"", but she says these livestreams ""lack dignity, and are humiliating"".
kTok's rules say you must have 1,000 followers before you can go live, you must not directly solicit for gifts and must ""prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation"" of minors on the platform.
But when the BBC used the in-app system to report 30 accounts featuring children begging, TikTok said there had been no violation of its policies in any of the cases.
After the BBC contacted TikTok directly for comment, the company banned all of the accounts.
It said in a statement: ""We are deeply concerned by the information and allegations brought to us by the BBC, and have taken prompt and rigorous action. 
""This type of content is not allowed on our platform, and we are further strengthening our global policies around exploitative begging.""
kTok, the world's fastest-growing social media app, has made more than $6.2bn in gross revenue from in-app spending since its launch in 2017, according to analytics company Sensor Tower.
BBC approached several charities working in Syria to support families in the camps as an alternative to making money on TikTok Live.
A local charity Takaful Alsham said it would provide basic supplies to the families for the next three months, helping the children find schools and covering their educational expenses.
But for many in the camps, there are few options to make money other than begging online. Hundreds of families continue to go live every day, and most of the money donated is still going to TikTok.

entertainment	Peaky Blinders dance show: 'Anyone who likes Strictly can love this'	"""An independent dance company, dedicated to bringing dance to the people,"" declares Birmingham's best-known gangster Tommy Shelby in an episode from series five of the hit TV series Peaky Blinders.
mmy is hosting a lavish birthday dinner at his country pile for his wife Lizzie with guests including fascist leader Oswald Mosley.
gang leader introduces a performance of Swan Lake featuring dancers from renowned company Rambert, which captivates the majority of the audience but sends his brother and partner in crime Arthur to sleep.
Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight is confident no-one will be dozing off during his latest venture, a real-life dance show called Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby, again in collaboration with Rambert, but on a much bigger scale.
Having also worked with the London-based company on that TV episode and 2019's Peaky Blinders festival, Knight was keen to bring the dance experience to a new audience.
""I'm the least likely person to attend a dance show,"" he says. ""And yet the experience I've had watching rehearsals... is absolutely fantastic. I really want to get that message out there that if you think you don't like dance, come and see the show and you'll find out that you do. Anyone who likes Strictly can love this show.""
Knight explains that he wasn't a dance fan before Rambert got involved with the BBC TV series ""simply because I'd never been"", adding: ""It's like going to your first football match and you go 'oh wow, it's brilliant'.""
Dance critic Lyndsey Winship says it can be difficult to attract new audiences to dance because of preconceptions: ""So many people love to dance, or to watch dance on TV, but would never think of going to see a stage show. So something with a well-known title and story like Peaky Blinders is a good way of tempting them into the theatre. 
""In the popular imagination, dance is still so often associated with ballet and Swan Lake and fairy tales, but the contemporary dance scene is so much more than that, and it's great if people's eyes can be opened to that.""
roduction begins as a prequel with the Shelby boys fighting in the trenches during World War One, but then it ""takes us through into a very familiar story, and it's not giving too much away to say it's about Tommy and Grace"", Knight explains. The pair's tragic romance will already be familiar to fans of the TV show.
Rambert's artistic director Benoit Swan Pouffer is the creative lead behind the production and is keen to point out that his interpretation is not just focused on the machismo of the leading male characters.
""When the young men went to the war, who ran the world? Who was doing the labour and working? Women,"" he says. ""There's always a sense of that in the show. I wanted to put forward the strength of the woman as well. I have male and female and non-binary dancers.""
Much of the story is told through dance and staging with no dialogue other than some narration courtesy of Benjamin Zephaniah, who plays Jeremiah in the BBC One series. 
""It's a great challenge to try to tell a story without words. But fortunately, Benoit and Rambert are masters at it,"" Knight says. 
""And so what I did was put some things down on paper and then handed it over to Benoit, he's crafted it and changed it and made it what it is now.""
Pouffer adds that Knight ""was surprised that I asked him to write a script, but that was my blueprint. Once I had this it was easier to... create the show because I was anchored in a good way with his vision.""
I'm curious to know how challenging it was to cast such iconic characters that are known to millions, particularly Cillian Murphy's Tommy.
""It's not about the physical aspects… you really need to understand who those characters are,"" Pouffer tells me. 
""Who is Polly? Who is Jeremiah? Who is Arthur? Rambert is a company made up of individuals who can tell stories naturally and that was even before Peaky Blinders, so it was pretty easy to cast because I have strong personalities in the company. And it was very organic.
""Human beings are complex. Tommy Shelby is a complex man with a lot of layers of sensibility. He is not just a bandit. You understand the reason why he's acting that way, his struggle and his hurt,"" he continues.
""And through what Steven wrote us, it really pushes forward this dilemma that Tommy has in his head and in his life. Through the show, you will have this journey of understanding of what makes a Peaky Blinder and why Tommy Shelby has this redemption.""
Four young dancers from the company landed the lead roles - Seren Williams and Prince Lyons will share the parts of Tommy and Grace with Guillaume Queau and Naya Lovell.
Williams says: ""We're not necessarily copying and pasting what you see in the series, we're taking the mindset of the characters… and translating that into movement, so there's still similarities between them.""
Lyons adds: ""We have a lead who is a white male and I'm clearly not a white male!
""You are watching a different idea and it's kind of forcing you to view this world in a completely different light, the same way that a white Ariel [from The Little Mermaid] would look completely different to the new Ariel that's coming out. It's forcing you to use a bit of your imagination.
""The same way that if you were to read a book, if the author didn't fully describe what these characters look like, depending on who you are and who you grew up around, you make your own opinions based on what you've gone through and the culture around you.""
He adds: ""I just hope that audiences are able to view the beauty of our interpretation.""
Knight has three things he would like the audience to come away with.
""I want them to have had a fantastic evening. I want them to be quite emotional at the end of it. And for them to go away thinking dance is something that they enjoy.""
w opens in Birmingham later this month.
Knight smiles. ""It can't be anywhere else.""

entertainment	Krept: Rapper branches out into making baby skincare products	"Krept, one half of rap duo Krept & Konan, talks about mixing music and entrepreneurship, for our business advice series CEO Secrets.
Rap star Krept sees himself as a local entrepreneur as much as a musician. 
His songs, like Waste My Time, G-Love and Freak of the Week, have been been streamed millions of times. He's enjoyed top 10 albums and singles, played to massive crowds at festivals around the world and fronted The Rap Game TV show. 
But setting up his own restaurant and seeing it thrive in the place where he grew up gives him equal satisfaction.
Crepes & Cones opened in Croydon in 2018. It's decorated with pictures of Krept & Konan and their music idols.
Krept - real name Casyo Johnson - has to be careful about when he chooses to dine there. If he goes when it's busy, fans will spot him and mob him for selfies and he'll hardly get a chance to put a fork to his mouth.
""It's a very big deal to me,"" he explains, sitting at one of his tables. ""When I was growing up I couldn't even visualise a place like this. I want it to be an inspiration, a message, so people round here know this is what can happen if you work hard.""
Krept & Konan grew up on council estates in Gipsy Hill and Thornton Heath in south London, where they were both caught up in gang violence. Krept has lost friends who died as a result of gang feuds. Others have gone to jail.
""We always wanted to do something that was bigger than just music,"" says Krept. ""Not everyone can do music, but there are so many opportunities out there, if you have a business mind. I mean, we're not professional restaurateurs, but I've always just had the business mindset.
""Even in school, aged 14, I used to buy drinks, sweets and crisps from supermarkets and sell them to the students.""
kills proved to be useful.
Krept shares his business advice: always 'over-deliver'
""The music industry itself is a hustle,"" explains the softly-spoken Krept. ""You have to network with people, to make songs with people. There's a lot I could take from the music world into the business world and our success there gave us hunger to try other things.""
Since their breakthrough album The Long Way Home in 2015, Krept & Konan have embarked on high-profile collaborations as their stock rose in the hip hop world.
In decades past, rock and punk musicians have typically cast themselves as rebels against the stuffy, conventional world of business. But hip hop artists have embraced the mantle of the entrepreneur with pride.
Last year Rihanna became a billionaire and it's thanks to profits from her cosmetics range Fenty Beauty, not her musical catalogue of smash hits.
Rapper Jay-Z was already a member of that exclusive club too, after building an empire based on music, property, fashion and investments. Kanye West owns a burger chain and has made a fortune from fashion deals.
re can be a practical reason for this, explains Krept. Many contracts in the music industry do not favour the artist, meaning even those who enjoy huge hits may not be making as much money as you think. 
wn case, he says, and it's one of the reasons why he has had to be entrepreneurial, with everything from concert ticket sales, to fashion endorsement deals and podcasts. It helped that he studied accountancy at university.
His latest business venture is in fact a skincare range for babies, called Nala's Baby. It came about after he became a father two years ago. 
His co-parent and now business partner Sasha Ellese Gilbert wanted to find a cream that had as few impurities as possible, so they developed one and named it after their daughter. 
Nala's Baby is marketed as being suitable for babies with eczema issues or sensitive skin, while also being vegan, animal cruelty-free and dermatologically approved. 
roduct is now stocked in Boots stores around the country and is expanding its reach. 
worlds of rap and babycare products may seem worlds apart, but Krept doesn't see a problem bridging this divide.
""It's my reality. I have a kid and I'm a rapper. Just because I rap it doesn't change the fact of being a father,"" he says.
""Anybody who has a kid, we go through the same journey of caring and loving a child. We bathe them, feed them, go through the terrible twos. I might be a rapper, this person might be an engineer, doctor or teacher. It's as genuine to me as it is to them.""
But does it pose a branding issue, when so much of rapping and business is about presentation?
world of the rapper, as played out in endless music videos - including his own - is often one of violence, confrontations with the law and the portrayal of women as disposable objects of desire. 
ry different to the world typically portrayed when advertising baby products, which is one of soft colours, domestic family bliss and doting parents. 
""Music is entertainment, it can be like being in a film or acting,"" says Krept, after considering the question. ""But this is how we grew up: friends dying, ending up in jail, being involved in gangs.
""Those are the cards we were dealt. I have friends still involved in that today, we can't help our upbringing.""
Krept says his music simply portrays his reality growing up - including the lyrics about women - and it's by coming from that authentic place in his music that he has created new opportunities for himself - so that he can be defined by something else.
He mentions Jay-Z as an inspiration, going from a life of crime in the New York projects to becoming ""one of the greatest rappers and entrepreneurs of his generation"".
""Because this is how we grew up,"" asks Krept, ""does it mean we can't do great things and grow as people?""
In 2020 Krept & Konan were awarded the British Empire Medal in the Queen's Birthday Honour's list, for their contribution to the community in Croydon. It recognised their creation of the Positive Direction Foundation, which creates opportunities for young people through music education.
""If you could get all the time back you wasted from procrastinating, imagine what you could do?"" says Krept, unprompted.
""That's one thing about me, I've always been great at time management, so I can do multiple things, I plan my days. 
""I think I will end up with multiple businesses, but I will never let anything dilute my music. I dedicate my nights to the music.""

technology	Is Finland's Wood City the future of building?	"It smells like a lush pine forest in the lunch room of a new upper secondary school in Helsinki, but there's no scented air freshener.
Instead, most of the five-storey building has been constructed out of wood.
won't be completed until next year, although smooth wooden panels already line many of the interior walls. Wood has also been used in load-bearing structures, to support the ceilings between the floors, and as cladding on the exterior.
""It's a more sustainable choice,"" says Miimu Airaksinen, an engineer and vice president of development at SRV, the Finnish construction company behind the school. 
""But we're also working with wood because wood is a nice material, people appreciate and like wood and the design of wood.""
roject is part of a growing trend in the Finnish building industry. Developers are increasingly swapping out more mainstream materials like concrete and steel, in favour of wood. It's linked to the country's ambitious efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035 and become Europe's leading circular economy.
With three-quarters of land in Finland covered by forests, wood is a readily available material here, although it does need to be strengthened for use in mid-rise and tall buildings.
In Finland, where detached wooden villas and summer cottages are common, there is less public concern about fires than there might be in parts of the world that are less used to using wood as a construction material. 
Nevertheless, SRV still faces questions about flammability, especially in taller buildings. There is plenty of evidence that engineered wood called CLT (cross-laminated timber) performs well in fires though, says Ms Airaksinen, since it is designed to withstand high heat levels and can be slower to collapse compared to concrete.
At the upper school construction site, her team is busy slicing up slabs of CLT which is produced by bonding together layers of wooden panels at right angles. ""You're making the wood stiffer, so that makes the wood much stronger,"" she explains.
Engineered wood like CLT has a range of environmental benefits, including being much lighter than many building materials, so less heavy machinery and energy is needed during construction. Buildings can also be quicker to complete since there is no drying phase as there is with concrete. 
Plus, wooden buildings actually remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they emit; they can hold in carbon that is absorbed from the atmosphere by trees for five to six decades. By contrast, steel and concrete leave massive carbon footprints.
""It can really help us with climate change,"" says Ali Amiri, a sustainable buildings researcher at Aalto University near Helsinki, and a former civil engineer.
""If we go through the comparison with wooden buildings and other buildings like concrete or steel or even brick buildings, [wood has] something like 20 to even 30% lower greenhouse gas emissions. So this is very good news.""
According to his team's research, if 80% of new residential buildings in Europe were made of wood they could store up to 55 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. That is equivalent to almost half the yearly emissions made by the continent's cement industry.
Engineered woods like CLT have been used in Europe since the 1990s, but they have had a resurgence in Finland thanks to a government-backed wood-building programme designed to ensure 45% of public buildings use wood as a key material by 2025. Developers can apply for grants and get help with tasks such as procurement and risk communication. ""I think every company [here] is doing wooden buildings today,"" says Ms Airaksinen. ""The pressure is on for sustainability.""
At the upper secondary school, gypsum board, which is made from limestone and not flammable, is used to add an extra layer of protection on the interior walls on higher floors. ""We need to take fire safety seriously,"" says Ms Airaksinen. ""We also did a lot of simulation about evacuation and durability in case there will be a fire."" 
wooden trend is catching on in the private sector too. Data from the Federation of the Finnish Woodworking Industries suggests it is already a key material in 4% of apartments and 16% of commercial buildings. 
In Helsinki city centre there's even a new neighbourhood, Wood City, with hundreds of new wooden flats.
It is also home to the headquarters of Finnish gaming giant Supercell, where huge carved wooden characters and dramatic curved panels make for an impactful reception area, and wood lines the walls of eight storeys of open-plan office space, cafes and even nap rooms.
Cybersecurity company WithSecure is in the process of building a new office next door, in collaboration with SRV and Stora Enso, a major Finnish producer of engineered wood.
And, perhaps least surprisingly, in a country where people famously love getting sweaty, one of Helsinki's most popular leisure attractions is a giant wooden sauna and restaurant complex. Opened in 2016, the Löyly complex has won multiple global awards for its striking wooden cloak-like structure, which allows visitors to climb up its sloping roof.
Environmental campaign groups such as WWF have raised concerns that increasing the construction of wooden buildings could put too much pressure on the planet's forests. 
""From a climate perspective it is a good way to store carbon, but on the other hand we are increasing the overall level of consumption of natural resources,"" says Mai Suominen, a leading forest expert for WWF. ""Because obviously we do need other wood-based products as well, such as paper or packing material, [and] if we plan to increase other production, we are increasing the level of cutting.""
Finland's wood production companies have committed to replanting logged areas in a sensitive and sustainable way. However, Ms Suominen argues that there is still a risk of lower biodiversity if production ramps up in future, which could have an impact on both animals and humans.
""Then the forest processes, at some point they collapse and they are not as flexible to responding to changing environmental conditions caused by climate change. We will face more rainfall, more drought and insect outbreaks.""
Sustainability expert Nani Pajunen from the Finnish Innovation Fund, Sitra, agrees it is important that construction firms in Finland and beyond don't simply jump on the bandwagon of the wooden buildings trend in an effort to appear greener. 
She argues it is more important that businesses make broad assessments of the carbon footprint of their production processes, and the different life cycle potentials of materials.
For example, other recent innovations designed to improve sustainability in the sector, such as recyclable concrete and steel, might be more durable than wood in large-scale projects such as very tall apartment blocks, public venues or bridges. 
""It's not a black and white question of which [materials] are wrong and right,"" she argues. ""It's about the attitude. You have to think, if you are an engineer in the construction sector, how to use materials in a more sustainable way.""
Despite the environmental concerns, the wooden buildings sector is growing, with other Nordic countries, Germany, Canada and the US in particular ramping up their production in the last couple of years.
More technology of business:
Market research company Fortune Business Insights recently valued the CLT market at $806m (£715m) and predicted growth of 14% by 2028. 
In the wake of the Ukraine war pushing up the global cost of steel and energy, Mr Amiri says his research team has also noticed a spike in enquiries from businesses and decision-makers from around the world. 
While Mr Amiri predicts wooden building construction will ""definitely increase"" in Europe and North America in the coming years, he points out that building with engineered wood for multi-storey projects is still ""a bit more expensive"" than using more common materials. This, he argues, might make it harder to persuade countries with access to cheap concrete and steel to switch direction. 
Back amongst the forklift trucks and diggers continuing to transform SRV's school construction site, Ms Airaksinen says she envisages the wooden building sector increasing in tandem with the development of new low-carbon materials. 
""We are focusing on building sustainable buildings and lifecycle wise buildings,"" she says. ""That's the future."""	/news/business-62798950
entertainment	Dua Lipa: Singer denies she is performing at Qatar World Cup	"Dua Lipa has denied reports she will perform at the Fifa Men's World Cup opening ceremony in Qatar on Sunday.
ger said she will ""look forward to visiting Qatar when it has fulfilled all the human rights pledges it made"" when it became host. 
Qatar has been criticised for its stance on same-sex relationships, its human rights record and its treatment of migrant workers.
Other acts including Robbie Williams and BTS's Jung Kook are set to perform.
In February 2021, the Guardian said 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had died in Qatar since it won its World Cup bid.
However, the Qatar government has said the total is misleading, because not all the deaths recorded were of people working on World Cup-related projects.
Lipa posted an Instagram story on Sunday, which read: ""There is currently a lot of speculation that I will be performing at the opening ceremony of the World Cup in Qatar.
""I will not be performing and nor have I ever been involved in any negotiation to perform.
""I will be cheering England on from afar... One love, Dua.""
Watch: Ros Atkins on… How Qatar got to host the World Cup
Lipa, born in London to Kosovar-Albanian parents, is not the first major name to make a point of not playing in Qatar.
Sir Rod Stewart recently revealed he turned down the opportunity.
""I was actually offered a lot of money, over $1m, to play there 15 months ago. I turned it down. It's not right to go,"" he told the Sunday Times.
""And the Iranians [football team] should be out [of the World Cup] too for supplying arms"", he added, in reference to Iran's supply of explosive drones to Russia, which Iran has denied. 
Russia was suspended from all competitions by Fifa and Uefa in February, after the country's invasion of Ukraine.
Other musical acts like US pop/rap group Black Eyed Peas and Colombian singer J Balvin, however, are also set to perform at events in Qatar during the tournament.
Comedian Joe Lycett, meanwhile, has issued an ultimatum to Qatar World Cup ambassador David Beckham.
Lycett has promised to donate £10,000 of his own money to charity, if Beckham ends his reported multimillion-pound deal with Qatar.
Homosexuality is illegal in the country, where same-sex relationships can be punishable by the death sentence.
If the former footballer refuses, then Lycett has threatened to shred the £10,000 - just before the World Cup opening ceremony.
Lycett says Beckham's ""status as a gay icon"" will also be shredded if he doesn't end his relationship with Qatar.
BBC has contacted David Beckham for comment, and his management responded: ""We aren't commenting at this time."" 
Beckham has been urged to speak out on the criminalisation of same-sex relations in Qatar.
Speaking to the BBC last year, a source close to the star said: ""Of course David wanted to ensure that he was informed about the facts and any concerns that he might have for his gay friends, football supporters and fans.
""Some of the laws and beliefs in the region differ to his own but the Qataris have always said that everyone will be safe and welcome at the World Cup in 2022 and he believes that commitment is sincere and has seen evidence of proactive engagement with the international LBGTQ community by the World Cup organisers.""
Qatar World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman made headlines last week after it emerged he had referred to homosexuality as ""damage in the mind"".
Human Rights Watch called the former Qatar international's comments ""harmful and unacceptable"".
Rasha Younes, LGBT rights senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: ""The failure of the Qatari government to counter this false information has a significant impact on the lives of LGBT residents of Qatar, ranging from fuelling discrimination and violence against them to justifying subjecting them to state-sponsored conversion practices.""
Organisers have said no-one coming to watch the tournament will be discriminated against.
Beckham's former England and Manchester United teammate Gary Neville recently appeared as a guest presenter on the long-running BBC topical news quiz, Have I Got News For You, and was questioned by team captain Ian Hislop over his decision to travel to Qatar to commentate on the World Cup.
""My view always has been that you either highlight the issues and challenges in these countries and speak about them, or you don't say anything and you stay back home and don't go,"" said Neville. ""I've always said we should challenge them.""
which Hislop replied: ""There's another option - you stay at home and highlight the abuses. 
""You don't have to go and take the Qataris' money. I'm not trying to be tiresome, but it is just not a very good defence."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63620686
health	Pat Cullen: Who is the RCN nursing union boss leading strikes?	"It may be surprising to hear Pat Cullen struck a tone of sorrow, not anger, as she led English and Welsh nurses into the first nationwide strike in the nursing union's 106-year history.
Speaking on the first day of the walkouts, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing called it ""a tragic day for nursing, and a tragic day for patients"".
union chief's sombre approach appears to have resonated somewhat with the public. While many feared for patients as the NHS weathered two days without nurses delivering any non-emergency care, two-thirds of people say they support the profession's campaign for better pay and working conditions, according to the latest YouGov poll this week.
As the top official for the RCN, Ms Cullen represents over 465,000 registered nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and nursing students. Around 300,000 of these are nurses, representing two-thirds of the profession.
At a time of deep crisis for the NHS, she is tasked with fighting for the welfare and rights of staff while also keeping in check with the frustrations of patients facing spiralling waiting lists, treatment delays and a shortage of resources.
But Ms Cullen, as she has described herself, is tenacious. She successfully spearheaded strike action in her home nation of Northern Ireland in 2019 to get better pay for nurses. That too was Northern Ireland's first ever nationwide nursing strike. 
Ms Cullen, a former psychiatric nurse turned RCN general secretary, has previously said nursing was ""in her blood"". 
58-year-old grew up in Carrickmore in County Tyrone, born to farmer Paddy McAleer and his wife, Annie. She was the youngest of seven siblings, with six sisters and one brother. 
Ms Cullen says she was inspired into the profession by her eldest sister, who would come home in a ""beautiful uniform"", talking passionately about her last shift.
""I remember thinking, even at that young age, it was just incredible how much she was able to touch people's lives,"" she told the Guardian earlier this month.
Ms Cullen did not pass her GCSEs so did not stay on for A-Levels and instead decided on nursing college in Carrickmore, a time she recalled to the Belfast Telegraph as her ""really happy years"".  
RCN chief was drawn to mental health nursing in particular after watching her mother take care of one of her sisters, who has learning disabilities. 
Working as a community psychiatric nurse during the height of the Troubles, Ms Cullen recalled the impact of the violence on mental health being ""shocking"".
It was during her time as an 18-year-old trainee in County Antrim that she started calling out what she saw as injustices in the system.
She wrote to hospital management over a ""heartless policy"" which punished patients whose behaviour proved difficult by taking away their personal possessions like sweets or cigarettes.
""I just felt that was such an injustice. Patients on the wards couldn't cope without their own personal belongings,"" she told the Guardian. ""I think I did win it; I felt great about it."" 
Royal College of Nursing leader Pat Cullen: ""My door is open""
Following her work on the front line, Ms Cullen worked as the professional head of nursing in a local healthcare trust, before joining the Department of Health as a nursing officer in 2001. 
Her husband of 30 years - Enda - also works in healthcare as a GP in south Belfast. Despite her best efforts, her two children are not in the nursing profession, but her son Shane is training to be a surgeon in Dublin.
It was in 2019, the year she was appointed the Royal College of Nursing's Northern Ireland director, that she was confronted with what she described as ""an injustice too far"".
Nurses' pay in Northern Ireland had fallen to 10 years behind anywhere else in the UK, compelling her to campaign for strike action, the first in the union's history.
A three-day strike led to Stormont striking a deal with the RCN, leading to the introduction of better pay, and legislation on safe staffing levels.
Now, Ms Cullen is leading a similar battle for nurses in England and Wales. She was appointed the RCN's interim general secretary and chief executive in July 2021, initially for a period of 18 months.
While the RCN and the government have held talks, Ms Cullen has insisted that everything has been on the table - apart from discussions on pay.
In the face of the strikes, Health Secretary Steve Barclay has said that the RCN's requests for a 19% pay rise was ""unaffordable"" during a cost-of-living crisis, but has said his door is ""always open"" to continue talks. He emphasised the pay offer was based it on recommendations by an independent pay review body.
With the union and the government in a stalemate, Ms Cullen has warned that there may be further action to come in 2023.
And in her own words, she describes herself as someone who will follow through on something she believes in ""to the bitter end"". 
""I'm hardworking,"" she told the Guardian. ""I have a really wicked sense of humour. That gets me through. And I'm tenacious. I'm definitely tenacious. When I believe in something I'll follow it through to the bitter end, I absolutely will."""	/news/uk-64065830
business	U-turns and Westminster turmoil 'cost me business'	"Political in-fighting and government U-turns have made customers cancel big orders, according to a family curtain-making business.
Mandy Jarman has been making curtains in Weston-super-Mare for 20 years, but has had more cancelled orders in the past few weeks than ever.
She said the political turmoil had made customers ""scared to spend money"".
A Somerset business group has found widespread cancellations hitting local firms after the changes in government.
Mandy said: ""It's the unnecessary luxury market, curtains, flowers, sofas, that is dying.""
Her elegant, quiet workroom seems a world away from Westminster.
She sits quietly at her sewing machine, or moves round large tables measuring out fabric for a big set of new curtains.
But the noise from SW1 has reached the seaside town where she has worked her whole life.
Five customers have cancelled orders. All face rising bills for gas, electricity and food. 
One couple decided they had to help their daughter pay her mortgage after interest rates rose sharply.
It is an example of how the policy decisions at Westminster ripple through this coastal town.
But a much bigger factor recently has been the constant changes of direction.
When Jeremy Hunt was brought in as the new chancellor, he reduced the government's help with household energy bills. 
Instead of capping prices for two years, the Energy Price Guarantee will only run until April. Then a new scheme will come in, targeted to help those he called ""the most vulnerable"".
World Bank has warned it is too expensive for governments to help everyone with their soaring energy bills and research suggests the UK's energy support scheme is far too expensive in its current form.
Politicians can argue the merits of the change, but in Mandy's showroom the immediate reaction was another cancelled order.
Mandy said: ""What's the point of saying we're going to do this to help you, and then three weeks later a new chancellor comes along and says 'sorry, we're not doing that any more'.
""People don't know what's going on, so they're holding on to their money now.""
Of course, it is not only curtains being cancelled.
In the middle of Weston, I meet John Mayer. He is a tax accountant who also runs the local Federation of Small Businesses.
He said he has been hearing the same complaint again and again.
""One thing businesses hate is uncertainty"", he said.
""And they've been through a lot recently, changes in prime minister, changes in chancellor, changes in policy.
""We just need some stable government now, and no more changes please.""
Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at King's College in London, said Brexit had also played a part in causing instability.
""The referendum has destabilised British politics,"" he said.
In the UK inflation is at a 40-year high of 10.1% and some retailers here have already had to shut up shop.
I first met Claire Morris back in the depths of Covid lockdowns. She had a small cafe in the middle of Weston, except it was closed like everyone else's in the pandemic.
She decided to change the business, offering the town its first zero-waste refill shop. 
Good and Proper Zero sold pasta and cereals, shampoos and laundry liquid. 
were all eco-products designed for people to bring their own containers and cut packaging waste.
As an entrepreneur she was not one to sit and wait for government help.
But when I popped into her shop, she told me she had decided to pack it in. 
Claire will close on Christmas Eve.
""To be honest it's a relief to have made the decision,"" she explained.
""The bills have just been mounting up.""
Her electricity bill has gone from £200 a month to £800 in the past 18 months. 
From December, she will lose the last bit of post-Covid help with business rates, and will have to pay the full rate.
""Energy and business taxes are just too high. It makes no sense to have a shop any more.""
Up the coast in Clevedon, North Somerset, Loraine Rogerson knows just what she means.
She started her local food store with her husband and daughter, showcasing the best meat, dairy, preserves and beers from North Somerset.
Even as people have tightened their belts and shopped more carefully, her customers have kept coming.
Iris Wheatley is in there buying some Somerset beef for dinner. ""It's a bit pricier, yes,"" she acknowledges, ""but it's so much better tasting"".
But Loraine is closing her shop down too. 
Why? Energy prices again.
""My electricity bill has gone from £600 a month to £1,200,"" she said.
""And that's with the government cap in place. What happens next year when it goes? I can't afford it.""
No further announcements have been made yet about The Energy Bills Relief Scheme that applies to businesses.
Like Claire Morris, Loraine Rogerson is a practical, energetic businesswoman. She will start something else.
But she says she can not plan what to do yet.
""We've got another new PM, we'll have yet another budget. We can't make any decisions until they do.""

wing signs of infection will be separated for a ""short period"" at the Manston processing centre in Kent, or at a ""designated isolation centre"" while they are treated.
follows the death of a man at Manston, which may have been caused by diphtheria. 
Health secretary Steve Barclay said the risk to the public was ""very low"". 
During a visit to the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, Mr Barclay said a ""very high uptake"" of diphtheria vaccinations within the British public meant many people were well protected. 
He stressed that the situation was being monitored ""closely"".
Diphtheria is a highly contagious infection that affects the nose, throat and sometimes cause ulcers on the skin.
According to the NHS website, it is spread by coughs and sneezes or through close contact with someone who is infected, and in serious cases can be fatal.
It can also be spread by sharing items such as cups, cutlery, clothing or bedding with an infected person. 
UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there had been an ""increase"" in cases of diphtheria reported among migrants arriving in the UK.
It has confirmed 50 cases were identified as of 25 November, including among children. The figure stood at 39 on November 10.
Public health experts have raised concerns about the spread of the disease as migrants were moved to hotels.
UKHSA report said 38 of the cases have been reported in south-east England, with some cases also detected across London, the West Midlands and the north-east of England.
re offered to people on arrival at their new accommodation.
Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said any asylum seekers who may have the infection but are already in hotels will be told to isolate in their rooms while they are treated. 
He later confirmed the isolation centres would be similar to those used to curb infections during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Mr Jenrick told the Commons: ""From today, no-one presenting with symptoms will progress into the asylum accommodation system.
""They will either remain at Manston, isolating for a short period, or they will travel to a designated isolation centre in secure transport where they will be treated until deemed medically fit.""
reatment of migrants at the processing centre in Kent has triggered a wave of campaigns and concern from health professionals and campaigners. 
At one point, the facility designed to hold 1,600 people contained 4,000. 
Charity Detention Action launched a legal campaign to remove migrants housed in the facility for longer than 24 hours.  
Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the overcrowding was caused by a lack of suitable accommodation.
She told MPs: ""What I have refused to do is to prematurely release thousands of people into local communities without having anywhere for them to stay.""
A post-mortem examination is being carried out to determine the cause of death of the man who died after being held at Manston.  A test indicated ""diphtheria may be the cause"" of his illness, government officials have said."	/news/uk-63788016
business	Buy now, pay later: Warning over use of credit cards to cover payments	"Young shoppers risk building up debts by borrowing money to make buy now pay later repayments, Citizens Advice says.
Half of 18 to 34-year-olds used different types of credit - such as credit cards or borrowing from family - to make the payments, it said.
Although the results were drawn from a survey, the charity said the answers highlighted the issue of people relying on one debt to cover another.
Changes are being made that make some of these debts clearer to lenders.
Buy now pay later has become a commonplace method of payment and credit for UK shoppers in recent years. It allows people to pay for purchases in instalments over a short-term fixed-payment schedule, and interest-free.
Some 17 million people in the UK, including 30% of those aged in their 20s, have used it. While popular, it has led to concerns over levels and visibility of debt - particularly as budgets are squeezed by the rising cost of living.
Citizens Advice surveyed 2,288 people who had used buy now pay later during the past 12 months.
It found that most (52%) made repayments from their current account, but 23% used a credit card, 9% used a bank overdraft, and 7% borrowed from friends and family.
Millie Harris, a debt adviser at Citizens Advice in East Devon, said: ""Most of the people I speak to who are using buy now pay later live off overdrafts and credit cards, so are using these for repayments. It is just relying on one debt to pay off another debt. 
""What scares me most is how easily people can slip into using it. They come to rely on it much more quickly than other forms of credit. It's just a few clicks at a checkout. Too often that means people don't realise how serious it is - that it is credit and there are consequences if they don't repay it.""
One in 10 people in the survey said they did not fully understand how repayments would be set up.
Chloe Porter, from Birmingham, used to use buy now pay later and admitted she was uneducated about credit.
""When I moved out [from her parents' home], I was struggling to keep the repayments up and I ended up having to use credit cards to make the repayments. I just dug myself a hole,"" she said.
Since the start of June, banks and credit companies have been able to see whether shoppers use services from Klarna - the biggest buy now pay later company in the UK.
firm said this could help or hinder its customers' ability to get credit for loans such as mortgages, but did offer more clarity to potential lenders.
Buy now pay later firms have been under pressure from watchdogs over contract terms and conditions and they information they give to credit agencies. Stricter regulation is expected soon.
ggest operators in the UK are Klarna, Laybuy and Clearpay.
A spokeswoman for Clearpay said: ""Globally, 90% of Clearpay transactions are made with a debit card and 95% of instalments are paid on time, demonstrating that our customers use their own money to pay for purchases and that they understand how our repayments are set up.""
She said the company was supportive of good regulation.
Earlier in the week, technology giant Apple said it was planning to launch a buy now pay later option for users of Apple Pay, initially in the US."	/news/business-61719592
health	The Scottish hospice struggling with the true cost of living	"Cost of living is a phrase that holds much more weight at Strathcarron Hospice in Denny.
Its web page states its ethos of helping people with life-limiting conditions to live and die well.
But soaring energy bills, inflation and rising costs of medical products mean it is getting increasingly difficult to maintain services at their current level. 
Without meaningful financial intervention from the NHS, bosses will have to consider making cuts.
Irene McKie, Strathcarron's chief executive, said: ""We always pay our staff the same rates as the NHS because we want to get the best people possible.""
But the hard fought pay rise on its way to some NHS staff, although well-deserved, would add about £600,000 to the hospice running costs. 
Ms McKie added: ""That is massive. We would need to find most of that money ourselves.
""We are a very specialist service with an incredibly fantastic range of staff. 
""And we pay for them with coffee mornings and 10k runs and ladies lunches. It seems ridiculous that's the way we have to fund the service.""
Currently one third of the hospice is government funded. NHS Forth Valley contribute £2.6m to running costs while NHS Lanarkshire contributes £550,000. 
Strathcarron has to fundraise £14,632 of its own money every day to keep the doors open.
Ms McKie said: ""We, in theory, get 50% of our funding from the NHS but in practice, it's 32% because it hasn't kept up with the rate of inflation.""
Since Ms McKie took over as chief executive of the hospice, the number of patients they care for in the community has doubled. 
However, NHS funding has not increased, meaning the services the hospice team has spent a number of years building are now at risk as people are less able to donate.
Ms McKie told BBC Scotland: ""We're now getting in to the situation where we're having to keep dipping into the bank account to keep going and we can't keep doing it because eventually we wouldn't be a viable charity or business.""
Strathcarron Hospice said it had tried to enter into talks with Forth Valley health board in October to review the level of funding it receives - something which was last done in 2006. 
Ms McKie said: ""We have said we're going to have to make big decisions if we don't get additional funding. We actually haven't had a response to that.
""The conversation we want with the health board is, what is it you don't want us to do? 
""Because they actually want us to do everything we're doing - they just hope we magically find the funding for it ourselves.""
re are 24 beds at Strathcarron Hospice but at any one time they look after around 400 people at home in the community, anywhere from Callander to Kilsyth. 
Paula McLaren is a community clinical nurse specialist. She visits people in their homes and advises on everything from pain management to financial support. The latter is something she is having to do much more regularly. 
She said: ""I saw a lady yesterday who has an advanced cancer, and at first I was met with a bit of hostility. 
""Her family were really frustrated, really anxious at the situation they're living in. They just don't feel like they've had very much support in the year and a half since her diagnosis. 
""She had overwhelming, really complex pain, nausea and horrible physical symptoms. But that wasn't her main concern.
""It was really her financial worries. How is she going to heat her home or pay her bills? And that's a worry for a lot of my patients at the moment.""
Paula was able to organise financial help and ensure she could stay at home as she wanted.
She added: ""At the end of the visit her husband actually fell asleep. He said: 'I'm just so relieved that someone is actually here to help my wife and answer all of these big questions we've had for so long'.""
Rosanne Verhees was diagnosed with metastatic Breast Cancer in 2014, which had spread to her bones. She is also worried about money.
She told BBC Scotland: ""I'm terrified the money is going to run out because I need to keep myself warm, I'm always really cold with my treatment. It's a huge worry.""
Rosanne said navigating a diagnosis like hers is terrifying but the care she's received from the hospice since 2016 has made difficult days a bit brighter. 
""Having them in my life, knowing you can get the visits and you have the support of different services, makes me think of myself as really lucky,"" she added.
As budgets continue to be squeezed and people have less money in their pockets to donate to charities, the level of need and the level of care required remains unchanged. 
Clackmannanshire, Stirling and Falkirk Health and Social Care Partnerships (HSCP) and NHS Forth Valley said they had a high regard for the palliative care services provided by Strathcarron Hospice and the positive impact this had in providing care and support for families at times of great need.
A spokesman said: ""We appreciate the financial pressures the hospice is facing and have supported the hospice to access substantial Covid funding support over the past two years.
""The Hospice has also received significant levels of additional funding as part of our local Service Level Agreement (SLA) most recently during the 2021/22 financial year in a bid to address a range of budget pressures. 
""A further interim funding uplift was provided in the current financial year which will be reviewed and updated once the NHS pay rise has been agreed.""
uthorities said that they would continue to seek ""open and active"" dialogue with Strathcarron.
kesman added: ""Recognising that all partners are experiencing, and will continue to face, significant financial challenges going forward, we remain committed to working with the hospice acknowledging the constraints of resources available."""	/news/uk-scotland-63951590

On Thursday, the Politburo - the ruling Communist Party's top policy-making body - said it aims to keep growth within ""a reasonable range"".
It did not mention the official growth target of 5.5% it had earlier set. 
China is continuing to pursue a zero-Covid policy that has put major cities into full or partial lockdowns.
In a statement after its quarterly economic meeting, the 25-member Politburo, which is chaired by President Xi Jinping, said leaders would ""strive to achieve the best results possible"". 
However, it also called on stronger provinces to work to meet their growth targets. 
Analysts said the lack of a GDP mention was notable, though economists had earlier predicted it would be difficult for China to reach its 5.5% target. 
""The 5.5% growth target is no longer a must for China,"" Iris Pang, chief China economist at ING Bank, had told news outlet the Wall Street Journal. 
China was urging larger provinces to make up for those that were more affected by the lockdown. 
""Beijing requested that provinces which are relatively well-positioned should strive to achieve economic and social targets for this year,"" Nomura analysts Ting Lu, Jing Wang and Harrington Zhang said in a note.
""We think Beijing is suggesting that GDP growth targets for provinces with less favourable conditions, especially for those that were hard hit by the Omicron variant and lockdowns, could be more flexible.""
Earlier this month, China said its economy had contracted sharply in the second quarter of this year.
Large Chinese cities, including the major financial and manufacturing hub of Shanghai, were put into full or partial lockdowns during this period.
China's once-booming property market is also in a deep slump, and home sales have fallen for 11 consecutive months.
Several Chinese developers have halted the construction of homes that had already been sold, because of concerns over cash flow.
In recent weeks, some home buyers have threatened to stop paying their mortgages until the work restarts.
In 2020, China made the rare decision to scrap its GDP targets, in light of the pandemic. 
GDP measures the size of an economy. Gauging its expansion or contraction is one of the most important ways of measuring how well or badly an economy is performing and is closely watched by economists and central banks.
It also helps businesses to judge when to expand and recruit more workers or invest less and cut their workforces.

Ms Mills said one of SailGP's biggest goals was around sustainability and raising awareness.

Ms Mills added: ""I think sport has an incredible power to change behaviour, to influence change and to make a difference in the world, whether it's through getting active and getting people engaged in sport, or for different causes like climate change and the environment. 
""There's many others, but I think with SailGP, that's one of our biggest goals is around sustainability and raising awareness, and beyond raising awareness, taking action.""
She added: ""You can see it with a lot of the projects that SailGP are helping fund and helping support in Plymouth and the local area in build up to the SailGP event at the end of July.
""It's just really cool to be a part of and as a sportsperson, it makes me really proud to be a part of that.""

business	Cineworld cancels The Lady of Heaven film screenings after protests	"Cineworld has cancelled all UK screenings of a film about the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, after it prompted protests outside some cinemas. 
ma chain said it made the decision ""to ensure the safety of our staff and customers"".
More than 120,000 people have signed a petition for The Lady of Heaven film to be pulled from UK cinemas. 
Bolton Council of Mosques called the film ""blasphemous"" and ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"".
But the film's producer, Malik Shlibak, said ""no one should dictate for the British public what they can and cannot watch or discuss"", describing the protesters as ""fringe groups"". 
film, which was released in UK cinemas on 3 June, claims to tell the story of Lady Fatima, the daughter of Prophet Muhammad. 
It has been criticised by some groups for depicting the Prophet Muhammad - which is seen as an insult in Islam - and for its portrayal of prominent revered figures in early Sunni Islam. 
It was pulled from the Cineworld chain after reported protests in Bolton, Birmingham and Sheffield.
In Bolton, more than 100 people protested outside the cinema, Bolton News reported.
In an email to Cineworld - reported by Bolton News - Bolton Council of Mosques chairman Asif Patel said the film was ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"" and ""misrepresents orthodox historical narratives and disrespects the most esteemed individuals of Islamic history"".
Muslim news site 5Pillars also shared a picture on Twitter of what it said showed 200 Muslims protesting against the film outside a Birmingham branch of Cineworld on Sunday.
Video footage circulating online appears to show a manager of a Cineworld cinema in Sheffield informing protesters that a screening of the film had been cancelled, the Guardian reported.
Mr Shlibak criticised the decision by Cineworld to pull the film, saying it was ""cowering"" to the protesters' demands.
He told the BBC: ""Now they see any time they're upset or mildly offended they'll do the same.""
Mr Shlibak added that there were millions of Muslims in the UK, and the protesters did not represent all of their views.
""We need to be very careful not to cower down to that and do the exact opposite, which is say to the people that we are tolerant, we accept different views and positions and we're happy to disagree, even passionately, but there should be no censorship involved."" 
But he also said the protests would fail at shutting down the film, adding that a ""large, large population across the UK have just heard about the film for the first time, so that's brilliant for us"". 
Health Secretary Sajid Javid also criticised the decision to pull the film.
Speaking to TalkTV on Wednesday, the health secretary said: ""You might not like what someone's got to say, but they have a right to say it.""
Mr Javid pointed out that there are no blasphemy laws in the UK and warned that would be ""an incredibly dangerous road to go down"".
""What we have in this country is freedom of speech and expression and that is a fundamental value,"" he added.
Unlike some incidents in the past, opposition to the film is not primarily about the way the Prophet Mohammed is depicted - though there is a CGI portrayal of him in it.
Criticism mainly centres around the way the Shia Muslim film-maker and cleric Yasser Al-Habib has portrayed prominent revered figures in early Sunni Islam, implying that there are comparisons between their actions with those of the Islamic State group in Iraq.  
Leaders of the protests have said while they want the film banned, their demonstrations were peaceful, but cinemas clearly felt their behaviour was intimidating enough to warrant screenings to be pulled.  
Outrage since that happened - including from some Muslims who had wanted to see the film - has been because a relatively small number of people have managed to exert their will in a way that that appears to normalise censorship on the grounds of blasphemy.
Muslim Council of Britain, the UK's largest Muslim umbrella organisation, has described the film as ""divisive"". 
In a statement on Sunday, the organisation said it ""supports those scholars and leaders who are advocating for greater unity and for the common good"". 
""There are some - including many of this film's supporters or those engaging in sectarianism in their response - whose primary goal is to fuel hatred,"" the statement added.
Screenings of the film were still scheduled for Wednesday at a number of Vue cinemas in London and south-east England.
In a statement, a spokesperson said: ""Vue takes seriously the responsibilities that come with providing a platform for a wide variety of content and believes in showcasing films of interest to diverse communities across the UK.  
""Vue will only show a film once the BBFC (the independent British Board of Film Classification) has assessed and rated a film. The Lady of Heaven has been BBFC accredited and is on show in a number of our cinemas.""
mpany would not confirm whether any screenings had been cancelled, but added: ""Decisions about how long a film remains on show are taken on a site-by-site basis and based on a variety of commercial and operational factors.""
A spokesperson for Cineworld said: ""Due to recent incidents related to screenings of The Lady of Heaven, we have made the decision to cancel upcoming screenings of the film nationwide to ensure the safety of our staff and customers."""	/news/business-61729392
business	'I had to apply to five banks before I got a loan'	"Lending to smaller firms has hit an all-time low, according to a study by the Federation of Small Businesses.
ustry group accused banks of ""pulling up the drawbridge"" to small companies.
One beauty clinic owner told the BBC she had to ""jump through hoops"" to get a business loan.
Lucie Grech applied to five banks for loans since setting up The Laser Lounge in October 2019 but has only just succeeded in securing any money.
Ms Grech had been seeking a business loan in order to expand her clinic in Manchester from one room to five rooms, but says the whole process was a ""nightmare"".
""This was mainly because I was a sole trader and no loan companies or banks would entertain me, even though my business is highly profitable despite the pandemic.""
She says she made multiple applications to banks trying to borrow anywhere between £5,000 and £50,000, but with no luck.
""I was jumping through hoops,"" she says. ""I couldn't get any financial support at all.""
Lucie's experience is far from unique, a report suggests.
According to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), successful finance applications plunged over the first three months of this year.  
urvey, which heard from 1,200 of the group's members, found that just 9% of small firms applied for new finance in the first quarter of 2022. Only around two-fifths of those who did apply were approved, a record low.
Over the same period, according to the Bank of England, lending to large companies increased significantly.
FSB also found that around a 10th of small firms planned to close, sell or downsize over the coming year. That equates to more than half a million businesses.
Six in 10 small firms were being impacted by late payments of invoices, the study said.
FSB's chair, Martin McTague, warned that without proper funding for small firms economic growth in the country will be stifled.
""Lenders pulling up the drawbridge for small firms will threaten our already faltering economic recovery,"" Mr McTague said.
""Businesses are born every day across the UK - many need funding to get off the ground, ensuring they reach a stage where they're profitable and creating opportunities.""
Mr McTague said a ""culture change"" was needed, with lenders taking an objective approach to small business finance.
Lucie has just managed to secure a loan, although she says it was £15,000 shy of what she was asking.
Still, she says it is a relief to have the funds at all.
""It wasn't till the day I got the money into my account that I believed it,"" she says.
""The whole reason I wanted the money was to expand my premises and create more jobs,"" she added. ""Hopefully this can happen now."""	/news/business-61460002
business	Post Office and Fujitsu to face inquiry over Horizon scandal	"ublic inquiry into the IT failings that led to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of Post Office branch managers starts hearing evidence from other key witnesses this week.
w stage of the inquiry aims to uncover what was behind one of the most widespread miscarriages of justice in UK legal history.
No-one at the Post Office or Fujitsu has yet been held accountable.
r of the inquiry said he was ""determined to expose the truth"".
More than 700 Post Office managers were given criminal convictions after a new computer software system, built by the Japanese firm Fujitsu, wrongly showed money was going missing from individual branches between 2000 and 2014.
usands of other sub-postmasters lost their businesses, as they were forced to pay back money which was alleged to be missing from their branches.
first phase of the public inquiry earlier this year heard testimony from sub-postmasters who were wrongly bankrupted and imprisoned. They described being treated as criminals by their employers and their communities. Dozens have had their convictions overturned, and many more are in line for compensation. 
xt phase of the inquiry will hear from the Post Office, government officials and the firm Fujitsu. It will examine who knew about the faults in the Horizon software programme, and what they did, or did not do, with that information.
r of the inquiry, Sir Wyn Williams, said the evidence he heard through the spring and summer had made a deep impression on him. 
In a recorded statement he said he was ""determined to expose the truth about these matters"". 
rocess is expected to take several months, with witnesses called who were involved in the design, roll-out, operation and management of the new system.
Earlier this year Jez Thompson, who worked on a team training sub-postmasters to use the new software system, told the BBC that problems were flagged up as Horizon was rolled out.
He said glitches and bugs frequently made the software fail to compute the sums, and he regularly passed that information up to his supervisors, who he is sure would have passed it on.
""I reported [these issues] to my line manager and he then reported that to a weekly meeting with Fujitsu Training Services, where both Fujitsu and the Post Office would have been present and glitches would've been discussed,"" he said.
But a member of Fujitsu's UK board, speaking for the first time exclusively to the BBC, said that the board wasn't aware of any significant technical problems when Horizon was being rolled out.
Andy MacNaughton originally worked for ICL, a British firm, that had the government contract to roll out new computers and accounting software in every single branch of the Post Office. After ICL was taken over by Fujitsu in 2000, it was Mr MacNaughton's job to manage the contract. 
roject was already running late, and he was under pressure, because the firm would only be paid once a ""working system"" was delivered, he said. 
He was unaware of any issues, and the system could not have been made live without the Post Office thoroughly testing and approving it, he added.
""We couldn't put a system in and make it live without the customer first accepting, signing off.""
""You can't force somebody to take something that they don't want or don't believe works. We just can't do it.""
Mr MacNaughton said he wasn't aware the Post Office were prosecuting staff or that Fujitsu data was used when sub-postmasters were prosecuted.
Metropolitan Police is currently investigating two people over potential perjury - failing to tell the truth under oath - during those trials. 
Fujitsu said it has ""been co-operating with the current Post Office Horizon IT statutory inquiry since it began and continues to be focused on helping assist its chair and his team"". 
It says it is committed to providing ""the fullest and most transparent information so that key lessons are learned"".
No-one from Fujitsu has apologised, and the company has not offered any financial contribution towards the compensation bill for the victims of the wrongful prosecutions. 
Mr MacNaughton said this might be for legal reasons. ""As soon as you start doing that, there is an admission of guilt and liability,"" he said.
And he doesn't feel there is anything to apologise for since he believes the Post Office failed to inform Fujitsu of the problems with Horizon. More than a dozen Fujitsu staff are, however, set to face questions at the inquiry in the coming weeks. 
Post Office used evidence from Fujitsu data, and called on Fujitsu staff as witnesses, when it pursued criminal prosecutions against more than 700 of its own staff. They were accused of theft and false accounting, with many others having their contracts terminated. 
Post Office has said it is ""sincerely sorry"" for the impact of the scandal on the wrongly accused postmasters, and that it believes the inquiry will ensure ""lessons are learned"". 
""Post Office is openly and transparently assisting the Inquiry in its important work to determine what went wrong in the past and to provide, as much as possible, closure for those affected,"" it said in a statement. 
Within the past few days the Post Office has agreed the first two full compensation deals for sub-postmasters whose convictions have been overturned. 
In the last year, the government has removed Fujitsu from its list of preferred suppliers, but the firm is still able to win government contracts through the normal procurement process.
A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) echoed Sir Wyn's determination to ""uncover the truth of how the Horizon scandal came about"".
utory inquiry should ""ensure something like this can never happen again"" they added. 
""On top of this, we are funding compensation for the postmasters whose lives have been so badly affected by this scandal,"" they said."	/news/business-63205335

technology	Holiday swindlers: The rise of digital travel scams	"Digital travel scams are a growing ""systemic and global"" problem, according to the World Tourism Organization, a branch of the UN. Dozens of Brazilian women have been finding this out the hard way, after paying for luxury holidays from a man whose Instagram account sparkles with opulent hotels and exotic locations.
Last December Maria (not her real name) decided to have a break from the heat of the Australian summer, and to take her family on a skiing holiday to Europe.
It was her first trip since the pandemic and she wanted it to be special. So she paid $20,000 to a travel agent, Rafael Bessa, a fellow Brazilian who had been recommended by a friend, and made the long flight north.  
gin with, everything was perfect, but as Maria checked out of the third hotel the manager told her the room had not been paid for. 
wo further shocks came in quick succession. When Maria contacted Rafael Bessa to ask for help, she noticed he was unable to talk to the hotel manager in French, despite his claim to have attended an exclusive boarding school in the Alps. Then, when the family boarded a train to their next destination, there was a problem with the tickets: he had provided two tickets with the same purchase number, meaning that only one was valid. 
At the next hotel it was a similar story: Maria had to settle the bill, even though she had paid in full already. 
Initially she had assumed Rafael Bessa was simply incompetent. ""Then I said, 'No, this is not a mistake, this is on purpose. This is in bad faith.'""
Altogether, Maria says she lost $30,000 on the holiday - $15,000 of the money she had paid in advance, plus an extra $15,000 for just one of the hotels. Maria says that as well as telling her he'd paid for the room, Rafael Bessa said he'd got her a free upgrade - but he hadn't, and the hotel charged the staggering full price for the super de luxe room.  
Rafael Bessa's promises of reimbursement came to nothing, Maria says. Although he sent her various ""proofs"" of money transfers, the cash never actually arrived in her account. 
, when she posted about her experiences on social media, she says his lawyer got in touch, offering to reimburse $20,000 as long as she signed a non-disclosure agreement. She refused. 
BBC asked Rafael Bessa to comment on Maria's allegations. He replied that there had been an unspecified ""problem"" with the price of one of the hotels, and that the room at this price had not been included in the package. He also sent copies of the train bookings - which, as Maria said, both bore the same purchase number. 
Another Brazilian woman, Ana Jalenna, booked an Alpine skiing trip and also an Italian summer holiday with Rafael Bessa, after he had organised a ""fantastic"" family holiday for her in Brazil.
She paid part of the bill in cash, and the plan was that he would put the rest on her credit card. Some time later, she was surprised to see a payment to British Airways appear on her card account and called him to ask about it. 
It was the payment for her Italian hotel, he told her. Finding this hard to believe, she emailed the hotel and was told no payment had been made.
Ana decided to ask Rafael Bessa for proof that he had at least made the bookings at the ski resort. He gave her two reservation numbers, but the hotel told her they were invalid. 
""I lost the money, the dream, the trip. I lost everything,"" she says.
She later spoke to other dissatisfied clients of Rafael Bessa's, and noticed a pattern.
""The first trip was fantastic and everything is OK,"" she says. ""And then he does a longer trip, a better trip with expensive hotels, and he does this to people.""
Rafael Bessa insisted to the BBC that he booked the Italian hotel. He said Ana cancelled the skiing trip, and he paid her back the money.
But Ana said she didn't cancel it - and wasn't reimbursed.
Holiday Swindler: The rise of digital travel scams
Social media is tempting people to sample the luxury holiday lifestyle, but what happens when it all goes wrong? This is the story of one Brazilian travel agent with a trail of unhappy clients around the world.
Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)
Maria and Ana were angry and scarred by their experience, but neither suffered financial hardship as a result.
For Adriane Trofin, a Brazilian working mother of two who lives in London, the failure of her dream family holiday to Greece this year was more traumatic.
She first came across Rafael Bessa on Facebook, captivated by his posts from beautiful locations, and struck up an online friendship. 
She explained that she couldn't afford that kind of holiday herself, but he replied that there were trips for every budget, and she ended up booking a dream holiday to Greece for 14 people in total - members of her family and a number of friends. 
Rafael Bessa in advance for the stay at a four-star Club Med resort, but the cars that should have met them at Athens airport didn't arrive.
Adriane messaged Rafael Bessa for help. He reassured her that everything had been booked, and gave her three telephone numbers for the car company, but she couldn't get through on any of them.
group was stranded for hours. Eventually, the airport operations manager for Club Med, David Doepfer, came to their assistance. He quickly established that there was no Club Med booking in Adriane's name. Rafael Bessa had once reserved rooms, he learned, but had not paid for them before the expiry date.
David called the travel agent and asked him to book a different hotel in Athens for the group, which he agreed to do. But David says that when he called the new hotel to check Rafael Bessa had stuck to his word he was told the rooms had not been paid for.
Adriane Trofin says her marriage is still badly shaken
In the end Adriane's husband paid for the entire group to stay in another hotel, at a cost of $8,500. 
""I spent that week, those seven days, discussing with Rafael day and night on the phone, trying to make him send at least a part of the money. He started to mock me,"" Adriane says. He also harassed other members of the group, she says, convincing some of them that the problem was Adriane's fault and that she owed him money.
""I was in hell. I had never faced a worse situation in my life, I never had anything worse in my life than those seven days in Greece.
""My marriage is still badly shaken by that. For me, it's a lot of money, you see? But it's no longer just about the money.""
She says the experience left her ""emotionally destroyed"".
Despite having assured Adriane, as she waited at the airport, that everything would be fine, Rafael Bessa told the BBC he had cancelled the hotel booking because Adriane had failed to pay everything she owed him.
But Adriane showed the BBC evidence of money transfers made before the trip covering the full cost of the hotel. She had agreed with Rafael Bessa to pay for three plane tickets in instalments, and was up to date with these payments - which Mr Bessa confirmed in screengrabs of messages he sent to the BBC.
BBC has spoken to 10 other clients of Rafael Bessa. Together with Maria, Ana and Adriane they say they paid him $90,000 for services that were not provided.
We also spoke to Brazilian lawyer Victor Penido Machado, who is bringing a case against Rafael Bessa on behalf of nearly 50 clients. They paid a total of $183,000 for hotel bookings and other services that were not delivered, he says.
A similar pattern is repeated again and again, the lawyer says. Clients arrive at their destinations, find a hotel has not been paid for, and are unable to get Rafael Bessa to pay them back. 
Approached by the BBC, Mr Bessa denied the allegations made by his former clients, saying he was ""shocked"".
""I'm really surprised by the amount of errors, 90% of your facts are false,"" he wrote.
UN's World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) says social media is increasingly being used by travel agents to persuade customers to buy a dream holiday - one that they too can look forward to posting on social media.
""Because they are being displayed on social media, tourists may have the perception that these services are more reliable than if they would find them on any regular website,"" says UNWTO legal counsel, Alicia Gomez.
At the same time, digital travel scams are on the rise all over the world, Ms Gomez says.
""This has become a global and systemic problem. Many national consumers and authorities are reporting an increase in online scams, and the number may be even higher as the shame and the guilt of tourists that fall for them discourage reporting.""
UNWTO has developed a code for the protection of tourists, which it says clarifies the responsibilities of social media companies, governments and consumers and describes how governments and private companies can best work together.
Seven countries have signed up to the code so far, making it part of their national legislation, while others, including Brazil, are in the process of doing so.
Meta, owner of Instagram and Facebook, told the BBC: ""We don't allow fraudulent activity on our platforms and work closely with law enforcement to support investigations and keep scammers out. 
""We continue to invest in new technologies and spent approximately $5bn last year alone on safety and security."" "	/news/world-63727404
sports	Keegan Brown: Players Championship winner 'buzzing' for return to Alexandra Palace	"Keegan Brown says he is ""buzzing"" to return to the PDC World Darts Championship after failing to qualify last year.
30-year-old won a Players Championship event in August and believes he is back on track.
""The difference has been practising,"" Brown told BBC South Today. 
""The last couple of years where I've been working at St Mary's Hospital my darts has come second and it's been really noticeable at competitions.""
Brown, from the Isle of Wight, will make his seventh appearance on darts' biggest stage when he steps up to the oche at Alexandra Palace next week.
He will take on Germany's Florian Hempel in round one on Friday, 16 December.
His best result at the competition was in 2018 where he progressed to the last 16.
""Every single darts player on the PDC Tour, all they want, is to qualify for Ally Pally and I'm over the moon to qualify for it this year,"" the world number 64 said.
""I felt absolutely awful when I missed out in 2021 so I made myself watch every single game to make myself realise how much I missed it.""
Following the disappointment Brown decided he needed to find more time to train if he were to rediscover his form.
He started throwing more regularly in his spare room at home which he has transformed into a darts room with a board and his trophies to remind him of past successes.
""Being a part of the NHS the last couple of years has been tough especially the first six or eight months of the pandemic,"" he added.
""I think between March and August I only picked up my darts about seven times and playing was definitely on the backburner.
""But going to work keeps me grounded and I enjoy my job. It gives me balance. I go to work to work and now I come home to practice darts.
""I made sure I practiced enough this year and so far the results have gone my way.""
Brown's hard graft paid off when he won the ProTour's Players Championship 23 in Barnsley over the summer to claim his first pro title in seven years.
It was a big moment for the part-time NHS blood lab worker who firmly re-established himself in the sport.
""I think we've had at least two or three prime ministers between my last two wins,"" he said.
""Seven years is a long time without a trophy but hopefully another comes soon. It shows that the game of darts is a marathon and not a sprint.
""Practice is going well heading into Ally Pally so it's literally in my hands.
""The atmosphere there is always second to none with 5,500 people chanting and cheering you on it's almost as good as a Christmas present - I'm buzzing for it."""	/sport/darts/63887920

technology	April Jones: Is the internet safer after April Jones' murder?	"April Jones' murder brought policies that were ""game-changers"" in protecting children, says one regulatory body.
April, five, from Machynlleth, Powys, was abducted and killed in 2012 by Mark Bridger, who had a mass of child abuse images on his computer.
Her parents pushed for change and the Internet Watch Foundation were given powers that has since seen them remove millions of images.
rganisation said it was a ""wake up call"" but they continue to face issues.
with being able to identify and remove abuse, they have found a ""national crisis"" around children being tricked into filming themselves at home, meaning they are more vulnerable than ever.
April Jones went missing on 1 October 2012 near her home, sparking the largest search in British police history.
She was abducted and killed by local man Mark Bridger, ""a dangerous fantasist"" and paedophile who received a whole life sentence for her murder.
A library of child sex abuse images were found on his computer, and evidence of search terms including ""naked young five-year-old girls"" as well as pictures of murder victims including the Soham victims Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.
He also had Facebook pictures of local young girls, including April and her sisters.
April's remains have never been found.
Following a campaign by her parents who said police were not doing enough, the then prime minister David Cameron granted the IWF additional powers in the UK to scan for and remove abusive images, working alongside law enforcement.
Mr Cameron was vocal after her initial disappearance, branding it ""a parent's worse nightmare"", particularly as she had cerebral palsy like his son.
He said about reforming methods of searching for material, he wanted to ""look her parents in the eye"" and have helped.
rs after April's death the chief executive of the IWF, Susie Hargreaves said the powers granted to them following April's murder were a ""game changer"" in internet safety.
She said April's death was a ""wake up call"" and she praised the ""bravery and courage"" of April's family ""to do everything they could to ensure it would not happen to any other children"". 
Ms Hargreaves said: ""It meant that we were able to massively increase the amount of images and videos of child sexual abuse we were able to take down from the internet, and I don't think that would have happened without the tragic events around April's death.""
At the IWF, 50 analysts work to remove the images, tracking down the source and where they are hosted, working alongside the Crown Prosecution Services and British police forces.
Ms Hargreaves: ""The year April died we removed 13,000 web pages from the internet - last year we took down 252,000 web pages.
""Every single web page we remove can have thousands of images - so that equates to millions of images of children being sexually abused.""
Hywel Griffith reports on how the case unfolded
IWF is one of very few organisations outside law enforcement globally, that is allowed to search for and remove these kinds of imagery.
Ms Hargreaves said online child abuse however ""is at an all time high"", with British police forces are recording more online child sex offences than ever and across more platforms.
""I have to face the fact that we will probably never eliminate online child sexually abuse, because it's a global issue,"" she said.
She added the IWF had seen a huge rise in this sort of crime in lockdown.
Prior to the pandemic there were 300,000 people classified as ""representing a risk to children"" in Britain.
In 2021, that figure rose to 850,000.
rity said there were eight million attempts to access child sexual abuse images in Britain, across three internet service providers, in the first three weeks of the pandemic.
Ms Hargreaves said it is also more common now for young people be ""tricked, encouraged and coerced"" into filming the content themselves.
""These children are in their homes, their parents often think that they're safe because we can hear the sound of domestic chatter going on in the background, and yet the parents seem to be totally unaware that their children are being preyed upon by paedophiles"", Ms Hargreaves said.
She added the images are often girls aged between 11 and 13 but said they are getting younger, and in the first six months of 2022, they removed 20,000 reports of self-generated content of children aged seven to 10.
""We have a national crisis around this, and we need to do everything we can to stop that,"" Ms Hargreaves said.
Dai Davies, a former superintendent with the Metropolitan Police, assisted in the Madeleine McCann case but also consulted for April Jones'.
He said whilst changes were made at the time they did not go far enough and there needs to both ""coordination"" and ""education"" in order to tackle the issue.
""It was 10 years ago now and what was shocking was the discovery that the accused had so much child images on his computer. It was indicative even then of the issue of child pornography online,"" said Mr Davies.
He said it is particularly important now as more and more children are tricked into creating the imagery themselves.
""Each image is a crime scene and a crime against children and we have to as a society address it.""
He added the crimes need to be prioritised and big companies held to account criminally if they are found to be negligent.
""Ten years on where are we? We are still dealing with this issue and the scale is horrendous.""
He said a windfall tax on these companies might be a way to support police and organisations in protecting children.
kes of Google and Microsoft have blocked thousands of search terms online, sometimes the searches are code words only known to perpetrators.
Claire Lilley, Google's child safety lead, said they were ""deeply committed to protecting children and our users from harmful content"" and take ""an aggressive approach"" to tackling and blocking child sexual abuse material.
She added they have ""invested heavily in teams and technology"" to removed material and help other companies do so, such as the IWF and The National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children in the US.
UK government recently said the Online Safety Bill, which will require technology companies to protect users from child-abuse images, is due to return to Parliament.
It said: ""The sexual abuse and exploitation of children online is an abhorrent crime. This government has a dedicated strategy to tackle it, backed by over £60m per year to pursue offenders, support victims and safeguard children.
""The Online Safety Bill will ensure tech companies are strictly obliged to remove any sexual abuse and grooming content to keep our children safe. Companies that do not step up will be held to account with fines of up to 10% of their global turnover."""	/news/uk-wales-63073562

ger rose to fame in the 1960s when she spearheaded the Tropicália movement alongside fellow stars Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso.
Her press team did not disclose the cause of her death.
Costa had recently had to cancel some concerts on doctor's orders after an operation, but had planned to return to the stage next month in São Paulo.
g tribute to Costa on social media included President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who called her one of the world's greatest singers. 
He said she was one of the main artists to put Brazil, and Brazilian music, on the world map.
""Her talent, technique and audacity enriched and renewed our culture, rocked and marked the lives of millions of Brazilians,"" he added.
Born in the north-eastern state of Bahia, a centre of Afro-Brazilian culture, Costa recorded more than 30 albums in her lengthy career.
Her best-known hits included Baby, Que Pena, Chuva de Prata and Divino Maravilhoso.

And during the years of Brazil's dictatorship, her trademark hippie style and often revealing clothing made her a symbol of defiance of the military authorities.
Gilberto Gil, who worked closely with Costa throughout both of their careers, said he was ""very sad and shaken by the death of my Gaúcha sister Gal Costa"".
Costa was a vocal supporter of Lula throughout his recent presidential campaign.

sports	Commonwealth Games: NI bowlers reclaim Commonwealth gold 24 years later	"You might have forgiven Martin McHugh and Ian McClure for choosing this moment to walk off into the sunset.
As Northern Ireland's veteran bowlers stood on rink one at Victoria Park, soaking up the sun and the applause on a glorious day in Royal Leamington Spa, one wondered if there would ever be a more perfect time to exit the stage.
It was the fairy tale moment in a remarkable story for the long-time team-mates.
McHugh and McClure, part of NI's men's four that won gold at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, had done it again 24 years later.
Only nothing about it felt like a swansong. The team, anchored by their two old heads, is not at the end of its run but rather feels right in its prime, thanks largely to the other two members of the four.
What McClure and McHugh bring in experience, Sam Barkley and Adam McKeown offer in youthful exuberance.
wo have provided not just their talents, but an influx of enthusiasm and drive that the team's elder statesmen relish working with.
""These boys. are the driving force,"" said McHugh, NI's joint flagbearer this year in what was his seventh Commonwealth Games.
""They're driving me on to produce, they're making me more hungry.
""They're here to take my title, I'm here to show that I'm still here, I'm still playing.""
roughout the tournament the team looked, and indeed sounded, like the perfect balance. McClure and McHugh were the voices you could hear from the stands.
""Come on, you,"" was the cry of choice if a bowl threaten to deter from its plotted path toward the jack. 
w two-time Commonwealth gold medallists knew when their team-mates need to hear from them. When to encourage and when to offer a word of advice. When to raise the intensity levels and when to appeal for a calm head.
Far from needing their hands held Barkley and McKeown relished the responsibility of being the team's  front end, but the experience at the other end of the rink was always there if they ever felt the urge to lean on something.
""I said to Adam in the very first game we played against Canada, the other pair were kneeling down at the other end of the rink and I just said to him 'look at that for a back end',"" Barkley, 23, reflected.
""Honestly, it fills you full of hope. It really does, they're legends.""
We've so much confidence in them, so much faith,"" McKeown agreed.
""We know they can play the big bowls because they've showed it and they were fantastic. They're inspirations to us all.""
Everything came together for the four players in the final. Having fallen behind early India tried desperately to wrestle just a few inches of momentum back, to sow a few seeds of doubt in their opponents' minds.
But never for a moment did NI flinch. India did not get to within five shots of the lead after the third end, and Northern Ireland sailed to a richly deserved win.
From all angles they resembled a team in its prime. Not one seeking to use the stage, perfect though it appeared, as a swansong.
As for what happens next, Victoria is only four years away.
""Why not?"" asked McHugh.
""The body is still going well and the mind is still going well. We have to go and defend our title."""	/sport/commonwealth-games/62451349

business	Warning of fewer rental properties as landlords squeezed	"Renters could find it more difficult to find properties in the next year or two as landlords struggle with higher mortgage rates, MPs have heard.
Ray Boulger, from mortgage broker John Charcol, said landlords may be more reluctant to hold on to buy-to-let properties which could have a ""serious impact"" on the availability of homes.
He said the situation was particularly acute in London and South East England.
Commons Treasury Committee has been hearing from mortgage experts.
was designed to review the state of the market during and following the upheaval of recent weeks, partly as a result of former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget.
New fixed-rate mortgages have risen sharply in cost during the year, and jumped in the aftermath of the mini-budget, when investors were spooked by big tax cut pledges that were set out without specifying how they would be paid for.
Mr Boulger said that the buy-to-let sector was likely to see more ""stress"" than other areas of the mortgage market.
He said that some landlords would find it difficult in some areas to secure a mortgage of more than 50% or 60% of a property's value.
, added to tax changes which have led some landlords to consider selling up, would reduce availability for tenants, he said.
About 40% of landlords have a mortgage on their rental properties.
Earlier this week, the Nationwide Building Society said that UK house prices fell by 0.9% month-on-month in October, the first monthly decline in 15 months.
rop was the largest since June 2020, at the height of the pandemic, the mortgage lender said.
Chris Rhodes, chief finance officer from the Nationwide, said that the outlook for the housing market was ""very uncertain"".
Mr Boulger forecast a 10% to 15% drop in house prices from peak to trough, partly because the ability to borrow was being curtailed.
Joanna Elson, chief executive of debt charity the Money Advice Trust, called for a public awareness campaign to urge people to seek help if they were struggling to make mortgage repayments.
She also called for some of the requirements on financial support to help with mortgage payments to be eased. 
re is also significant pressure on renters, which made up the majority of those seeking help from the charity, she told MPs.
People tended to prioritise paying for ""the roof over their heads"", she said. 
Figures seen recently by the BBC suggest that people under 30 are now spending more than 30% of their pay on rent - marking a five-year high.
Experts said this level of rental costs is unaffordable and warned that younger tenants could face a difficult winter as costs and energy bills mount."	/news/business-63486784

technology	TikTok blamed by filmmaker for allowing abusive comments on video	"A video on TikTok about sexual consent has been swamped with comments from men accusing women of alleging assault.
Many of them mention Andrew Tate, the controversial influencer who has been banned from several platforms for his misogynist views.
wo-minute video, from an account with about 1,700 followers, has been viewed more than 1.2 million times.
Its creator Emmeline Hartley believes TikTok's algorithms are driving more hateful comments towards the film.
People using TikTok are served content based on a mixture of videos they have previously liked, and on which people like them have watched and commented.
kTok said misogyny was prohibited on the platform. 
""Our community guidelines specifically call it out as a hateful ideology and we are crystal clear that we do not want that content on our platform,"" said a spokesperson.
It added that it had removed more than 100 comments from Ms Hartley's video, which it said was a small proportion of the number that had been left. 
Ms Hartley said she had found it impossible to make direct contact with someone from the platform to get help.
""We don't have the capacity or the manpower to respond to all the comments,"" Ms Hartley said.
Her intention was to present a complicated but common scenario about sexual consent but she said she was concerned to see the film being used by some of those commenting as an example of women ""tricking"" men.
""I thought, 'what have I done? I've made a film that's helping rape culture'.""
She says she has seen other videos on TikTok that have been swamped with abusive comments where the creator is appealing for likes and positivity to help ""pull them back from the wrong side of TikTok"".
Ms Hartley's original video, Keep Breathing, was 18 minutes long and made in 2018, with funding from various local organisations in Derby and backed by the British Film Institute.
It is a fictional story featuring a couple arguing in a lift about a previous sexual encounter, interwoven with flashbacks to the evening it took place.
racters had both been drinking alcohol, they met in a nightclub, and there were misunderstandings about how they were going to get home and whether the man was going to stay with the woman. 
However, the clip she posted to TikTok in September featured only the pair's argument and not the contextual flashbacks. When Ms Hartley tried to add a separate video featuring those, they were repeatedly removed by TikTok on the grounds that they were explicit.
She has now been able to share the context, but says there are still many comments which are abusive towards women.
Although she considered removing the videos, Ms Hartley says she is content that she decided to share the post.
""I don't regret it, but I'm trying to navigate how to respond,"" she said.
""Some of the comments have been healthy, a couple of people have changed their minds while replying to each other. I think it's important, it needs to go out there.""
Social media consultant Matt Navarra said that TikTok's algorithm functions as a recommendation service, drawing both on the previous activity of the individual user and others like them, in order to serve up new content with which the person is also likely to engage. 
keeps them on the platform for longer and more frequently, which is good for advertisers and therefore also good for TikTok's advertising revenue.
""It means if this content has been seen, engaged with and liked by a group of users who are, for example, Andrew Tate fans, then it's likely to show that piece of content to even more people who are that sort of user,"" he said. ""It's self perpetuating.""
reator cannot stop this train once it is in motion, because they have no control over the algorithm itself and there are limited options for reporting issues, Mr Navarra added.
In July it was reported that Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, was going to make its algorithm more similar to TikTok's, rather than prioritising content from accounts that individuals were already following. "	/news/technology-63243423
entertainment	Kevin Spacey faces New York jury in sexual assault court case	"Kevin Spacey appeared in a New York court on Thursday to face an accusation by fellow actor Anthony Rapp that he was sexually abused by the actor as a minor.
Star Trek: Discovery star Rapp, now 50, filed a complaint against Spacey in 2020, for advances and an alleged sexual assault at a party in Manhattan in 1986, when he was 14.
House of Cards star, 63, has always denied the allegation.
Rapp is seeking $40m (£36m) in damages.
During opening arguments in the case, presided over by Judge Lewis Kaplan, Rapp's lawyer Peter Saghir told a jury of six men and six women that Spacey, then in his late 20s, committed ""unacceptable"" acts against his then-teenaged client, ""intentionally to satisfy the drive of his sexual desires"".
ged assault, at Spacey's New York apartment, ""never should have happened"", Mr Saghir continued. ""He was 14 years old.""
Spacey, who went on to star in films like The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, has kept a fairly low profile since the allegation, which emerged in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which highlighted widespread abuse in the film industry.
Last month, Rapp spoke about his accusation in an interview with BuzzFeed News.
Spacey responded online, offering his ""sincerest apology"" to Rapp for any ""deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour"", saying he did not recall the alleged incident.
Rapp filed a civil lawsuit after a 2020 criminal charge of sexual assault was dismissed by a judge. 
According to court documents, Rapp claims that during the party 35 years ago, Spacey lifted him up and that his hand ""grazed"" his buttocks. He claims Spacey then placed him back down on a bed and ""briefly placed his own clothed body partially beside and partially across"" his own.
He told the court there had been ""no kissing, no undressing, no reaching under clothes, and no sexualised statements or innuendo,"" during the alleged incident which lasted no more than two minutes. 
His lawyer said Spacey's behaviour was ""wrong and frankly unacceptable."" ""This was not horseplay,"" he added.
Spacey's own lawyer Jennifer Keller, however, told the jury that such an assault ""never happened at all"".
She noted how down the years, Rapp had ""repeated the same false story [but] never repeated it to the police"", arguing he had done so for ""attention [and] sympathy"" because he never became an international star.
Ms Keller previously told AFP in an email: ""We look forward to his vindication by an impartial jury.""
rial is expected to last for two weeks, and, if found guilty, Spacey faces significant damages.
In August, a judge ordered Spacey to pay House of Cards producers $31m (£25.5m) for the costs involved in removing him from the series following a string of allegations of sexual misconduct.
He appeared at the Old Bailey in London in July to ""strenuously"" deny allegations of sexual assault by three other men, dating back 17 years to when Spacey was artistic director at The Old Vic theatre.
A trial will take place in June 2023, with a pre-hearing expected to take place early next year."	/news/entertainment-arts-63169572
business	Buy now, pay later: Warning over influencers' adverts on social media	"Some influencers fail to highlight the potential risks of buy now, pay later (BNPL) products when they post adverts online, a regulator has warned.
Financial promotions must explain the issues of unaffordable debt and missed payments, even if the product itself is unregulated.
But the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that consumers could be misled by some BNPL adverts.
It said posts must be clear and fair, and include prominent risk warnings.
""As we face a cost-of-living crisis, consumers are having to make difficult decisions about their finances and how they pay for goods and services,"" said Sheldon Mills, executive director at the FCA.
""Firms need to ensure consumers, particularly those in vulnerable circumstances, are equipped with the right information at the right time, so they can make effective, timely and properly informed decisions.""
Buy now, pay later has become a commonplace method of payment and credit for UK shoppers in recent years.
It allows people to pay for purchases in instalments over a short-term fixed-payment schedule and interest-free.
Some 17 million people in the UK, including 30% of those aged in their 20s, have used it. While popular, it has led to concerns over levels and visibility of debt - particularly as budgets are squeezed by the rising cost of living.
Buy now, pay later firms have been under pressure from watchdogs over contract terms and conditions, but as yet these services remain unregulated.
In June, the government unveiled plans to change that situation, including a requirement for providers to be approved by the FCA. 
roposals also included guidelines on advertising and checks to ensure customers can afford to pay.
But, even before such plans become law, there are already rules that mean unauthorised firms could be committing a criminal offence if they do not have an FCA-authorised firm approve their financial promotions. Such promotions include posters in shop windows, paid for Google ads, and posts made by influencers on social media.
watchdog said it had seen financial adverts on websites and social media which could have breached rules by failing to include prominent warnings on: 
So far this year, the FCA said its action against firms that had breached its rules had led to 4,226 promotions being changed or withdrawn.
However, debt charities say that the regulation itself needs to be clearer and more consistent.
""A patchwork of rules and protections, depending on which provider you use, is a poor placeholder for clear and consistent regulation,"" said Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice.
""The Treasury said it will regulate, but everyday that passes without action leaves consumers unprotected and unaware of the consequences of this new form of credit."" "	/news/business-62603257
business	House sales peak in July but buyers are cautious	"More homes were sold in the UK in July than in any other month this year, official figures show, but agents say buyers are showing more caution.
Cost-of-living pressures were leading some to negotiate harder for a lower price, agents said.
A total of 110,970 properties were sold in the UK during the month - the highest since September, HM Revenue and Customs data shows.
Activity in the housing market usually picks up during the warmer months.
Sales surged during, and despite of, the pandemic as people searched for more inside and outdoor space, then slowed in the second half of last year.
Consistent monthly sales of around 100,000 this year show that demand remains comparatively strong, but there are signs that the squeeze on budgets caused by rising prices and bills were having an effect.
Sales in July were still 33% higher than the same month last year and 7.2% higher than June, HMRC said.
Nathan Emerson, chief executive of the estate agents' trade body Propertymark, said: ""These figures show the housing market remains stable with transactions up month-on-month, year-on-year and well above pre-pandemic levels.
""The cost of living is still rising and we are seeing evidence of buyers negotiating harder, bringing price increases down. But our data from member agents shows the demand remains strong and that there with not enough stock to go round with the number of new potential buyers seven times higher than new homes coming to the market.""
Other commentators have suggested that more nervous buyers could lead to lower prices. Property portal Rightmove recently suggested that asking prices had dropped for the first time this year in August.
North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said ""concerns about the rising cost of living and interest rates are prompting a more cautious approach"" from buyers, which meant sales were taking a little longer than previously.
Bank of England has regularly raised interest rates as the cost of living has soared, meaning new buyers are facing more expensive mortgages than seen in recent years.
Julie-Ann Haines, chief executive of the Principality Building Society, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that another 1.8 million homeowners were coming to the end of a fixed-rate home loan next year, so demand and pressure on banks and building societies was increasing.
She added that there were no signs of a UK housing market crash, although a slowdown was more likely."	/news/business-62646676

fender, who previously played for Hartlepool United, said he had been left feeling ""belittled"" after hearing abuse.

He said abuse on social media was not dealt with properly and an online ban did not go far enough.
Recent abuse of England players highlighted how there were few punishments for supporters, Mr Odusina said.
""For example online, if someone is being racist on Twitter, I think you find the person who it is and you do a couple of months in jail.
""But you still have the problem where they are actually still racist, so in a sense nothing has really changed. They're just not able to show they're racist online. I think that action is jail time.""

""I didn't knowingly commit fraud. I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was,"" he told the BBC, shortly before his 12 December arrest in the Bahamas, where he lived, and FTX was based. 
wo of Mr Bankman-Fried's closest colleagues pleaded guilty to fraud on Wednesday and are helping with the investigation.
Federal prosecutors in New York have accused Mr Bankman-Fried of unlawfully using customer deposits made at FTX to fund his other crypto firm, Alameda Research, buy property and make millions of dollars in political donations. 
In a press conference last week, they described it as ""one of the biggest financial frauds in US history"" announcing eight criminal charges, including wire fraud, money laundering and campaign finance violations. Financial regulators have also brought civil charges.
Mr Bankman-Fried spent nine days in prison in the Bahamas weighing his choices before telling the Nassau magistrates' court on Wednesday that he would not fight extradition, which could have sparked a long legal fight. 
At Thursday's court hearing in New York, assistant US Attorney Nick Roos said prosecutors would not oppose releasing Mr Bankman-Fried on bail, despite a ""fraud of epic proportions"", pointing to his decision to return to the US voluntarily and his much diminished financial state. 
Mr Bankman-Fried's release requires him to surrender his passport and submit to location monitoring and detention at his parents' home in California. He also agreed to regular mental health treatment. His parents will co-sign the $250m bond, Mr Bankman-Fried's attorney, Mark Cohen said.
f two Stanford University professors, Mr Bankman-Fried founded FTX in 2019. 
Known to his legions of fans as SBF, the curly-haired MIT graduate was a hero in the crypto world, nicknamed the 'King of Crypto' and known for bailing out struggling firms and making massive donations to charity. 
f his firm, which was once valued at more than $30bn (£25bn), has unsettled the wider industry, sparking bankruptcy filings at other firms and further declines in crypto values.
firm declared bankruptcy in November, after customers and investors rushed to pull their funds from the firm amid reports that its finances were shaky.
Mr Bankman-Fried, who stepped down as chief executive the same day, has previously denied deliberate wrongdoing, and said he is focused on restoring funds to customers. 
At Thursday's arraignment, Mr Bankman-Fried spoke only once, when asked if he understood the conditions of his release, and that he could be charged with an additional crime if he fails to show up to court.
""Yes I do,"" he replied."	/news/business-64068810
technology	MrBeast overtakes PewDiePie as most-subscribed YouTuber	"MrBeast has ended PewDiePie's reign as the YouTuber with the most subscribers - the first change at the top in almost 10 years.
Swedish creator PewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, became the most-subscribed YouTuber in August 2013 with his gaming reaction videos.
In 2019, he was the first person to attract 100 million subscribers.
But the philanthropy of MrBeast, really called Jimmy Donaldson, gained him his 112 millionth subscriber this month.
Although YouTube does not show the exact numbers, that pushed him above PewDiePie's 111 million.
MrBeast is known for videos featuring huge cash giveaways and prizes, as well as charity work.
In 2021, he launched a separate philanthropy-themed YouTube channel, which itself has more than 10 million subscribers, and he has a licensed charity that functions as a food bank to feed communities across the US.
He and fellow YouTuber Mark Rober organised international collaborative fundraisers TeamSeas and TeamTrees, which focus on environmental issues - the latter raising more than $24m (£16.7m) to plant 20 million trees worldwide.
And PewDiePie himself donated almost $70,000 to the TeamTrees project.
British YouTuber Steven Bridges, whose videos have millions of views on the platform, told the BBC MrBeast has ""mastered the skill"" of making compelling content.
""There's probably no other YouTuber in the world who understands it as well as MrBeast,"" he said. 
""Making an entertaining video is one thing, but ensuring that every single second of a video keeps the viewer hooked is very difficult to pull off, and MrBeast's retention - the percent of the video the average viewer watches - and view counts speak for themselves.
""Really, MrBeast is playing the game of making the most entertaining videos that appeal to the biggest number of people, and he's consistently knocking it out of the park. 
""I don't think there's any YouTuber out there that's surprised MrBeast has taken the number one spot.""
ugh neither has yet commented on the milestone, PewDiePie previously said he thought MrBeast would ""definitely"" overtake him.
""I can't wait for it to be over,"" he joked in a video from August 2022. ""He definitely deserves it. I hope he does it.""
And while MrBeast has become the most-subscribed individual user on YouTube, he is some way off having the biggest YouTube channel. 
-Series, an Indian music video publishing company, leads the way in that category with more than 200 million subscribers.
Despite their apparent rivalry for the top YouTuber crown, MrBeast publicly supported PewDiePie when the music video channel rose to prominence.
In 2018, PewDiePie had the top YouTube channel altogether, and became embroiled in a - mostly jokey - public rivalry with T-Series over the top spot.
MrBeast was the first prominent YouTuber to make videos supporting PewDiePie, buying radio adverts and billboards in North Carolina urging people to subscribe to him.
Over the course of a year, PewDiePie eventually lost the top channel spot to T-Series, although he went from about 60 million to 90 million subscribers in the contest, making his lead as top YouTuber apparently unassailable.

health	Intensive care delirium: 'I hallucinated that I'd been kidnapped'	"When Jan Ehtash woke up she immediately began to panic. She was lying on her back, paralysed from the neck down and was terrified about what was happening to her.
""I thought 'I've been kidnapped, I'm here now, can't move, I can't talk and there's all these weird people walking around with great big helmet-type things',"" she says.
Believing her captors were about to begin experimenting on her, the 58-year-old tried to work out how to escape. But all she could do was lie motionless, surrounded by strange machinery which continually beeped and whirred.
It was at that point she realised the machines had their own language.
""I thought they were communicating, these machines, they were communicating with each other,"" she says.
""It was just very frightening, it was so frightening.""
group helps patients come to terms with their experiences
But Jan hadn't been kidnapped and the machines were not talking. She was actually in an intensive care ward in a south London hospital having spent five weeks in a coma battling a Covid infection that had almost killed her. 
It was January 2021. Her abductors were actually the doctors and nurses who had saved her life. 
Her paralysis was only temporary and her hallucinations had been brought about by a surprisingly common phenomenon called intensive care delirium, or ITU delirium.
""Being admitted to intensive care feels - to the patient - similar to being imprisoned,"" explains Dr Larry Mulleague, an ITU consultant who treated Jan at St Helier Hospital, in Carshalton.
""There is an acute loss of control, as well as fear, great difficulty in being understood, and physical and emotional distress.""
According to Dr Mulleague, ITU delirium affects more than half of patients at the trust, but the experiences of patients are rarely the same.
""Some of the luckier ones may imagine themselves as an extra character in a favourite book like Alice in Wonderland, but more frequently the hallucinations are very frightening with themes of being kidnapped, tortured, drowned, and spied on,"" he says.
Jan's journey to this strange world began several weeks earlier when she contracted Covid. 
Struggling to breathe, she was admitted to St Helier Hospital having only brought a handbag with her, convinced that she would be discharged within a day. 
r told Jan, ""We can't promise that you'll come out of this,"" and said she should call her family. It was Boxing Day.
""So I phoned up my husband and the children, which was horrific,"" she says. ""My youngest daughter screamed down the phone and said, 'Mum, I can't lose you. You've got to fight this.'""
Nearly two years later, Jan still wells up thinking about that moment. ""How can I say their mum isn't going to be around? I couldn't even give them a hug. It was a phone call.""
Jan was sedated and put on a ventilator. 
""She was probably one of the most unwell patients we had,"" explains Jessica Gregory, senior sister at St Helier Hospital's ICU. ""We were extremely worried about whether or not she was going to survive.""
It would be five weeks until Jan woke up to her strange visions.
She was eventually discharged from hospital with a carrier bag of medication and unsettling flashbacks from her time in a coma. 
She recalled one of her daughters talking to her and another lying on her chest. She remembered being wrapped in a sheet and turned on her front whilst being ventilated. 
All of these had taken place, but it was difficult to distinguish what was real from what was not. 
She also found it difficult adjusting back to life at home. For a time she could only sleep if she played videos of the same beeping machines from intensive care on YouTube.
""It was a comfort in the end... I needed to hear those machines for some reason,"" Jan says.
Rhyan Fuller had a similar experience to Jan. He was induced for the same reason - a life-threatening Covid infection. 
He had also not realised how close to death he was. But the 40-year-old business analyst's hallucinations were more prosaic. 
""It was random things like speaking to people while I was outside next to the river. And I'm like, 'well there's no river in St Helier',"" he says.
Rhyan also believed he'd recently collected his laptop from the second floor of the hospital. 
""That's a really weird place to be in whilst you're trying to recover,"" he says.
While aspects like illness, age, medicines, noise levels and insomnia are thought to contribute to the delirium, research continues into its cause and how it can be treated and prevented.
""There are practical remedies that we provide in our hospitals - a window and a clock with a 24-hour face so patients can orientate themselves to day and night, quieter machine alarms,"" Dr Larry Mulleague says.
""We also offer early physiotherapy, frequently tell patients where they are, provide glasses and hearing aids, and play their favourite music. Hearing a familiar voice or feeling the touch of family members helps, too.""
He adds about the importance of providing support to patients even after they leave hospital, with support groups and specialist psychologists on hand.
""Fortunately by the time we see them in our follow-up clinic three months after discharge, the rawness of those memories and the emotions they elicit have gone. 
""But explaining how common these thoughts are for survivors is often the validation they, and their families, need,"" he says.
with their recovery, both Jan and Rhyan are part of a peer support group for those who have experienced ITU delirium, based at St Helier Hospital.
In a small room under fluorescent lights the patients discuss their close brushes with death and their hallucinations. 
One woman explains how she thought she was magnetised to her bed, another says she kept seeing the American detective Columbo. 
majority of attendees have recovered physically and these sessions aim to aid their psychological recovery from intensive care.  
""I went to the first group and they answered every question I had,"" says Jan. 
""You're thinking, 'Am I normal? Am I going crazy?' But then you hear other people have experienced the same thing and you're like, 'Oh my god, it's not just me.'""
Maria Carroll, a senior ICU nurse, believes patients find it ""very beneficial"". The medics might understand their journey to a degree, she says, ""but we haven't walked in their shoes. We don't get it like they get it, and they have something in common that they'll have in common with nobody else"".
Rhyan agrees about the benefits of learning from other people's experiences.
""There are going to be people there who might say things that will make this entire journey a little easier to digest,"" he says. 
""And there are also those that might want to hear, depending on how far along they are, that it's hard - it's really hard - but it does get better.""

business	Macau shuts down casinos following Covid outbreak	"Macau closed all its casinos for the first time in more than two years on Monday after a coronavirus outbreak in the world's biggest gambling hub.
Authorities have ordered non-essential businesses, which includes over 30 casinos, to shut for a week.
recorded 1,526 Covid cases since the middle of June according to official figures.
Gaming shares slipped on Monday over concerns of tougher rules in the Chinese special administrative region.
Around 19,000 people have been put in mandatory quarantine as the city tackles its worse Covid-19 outbreak since early 2020. 
Schools and entertainment venues, including bars and cinemas, had already been closed under earlier guidelines.
Over the weekend, Macau's Government Information Bureau said all businesses would be required to suspend their operations unless they were ""deemed essential to the community and to the day-to-day lives of the members of the public"".
""The latest step is in order to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the community,"" the bureau said in a statement on Saturday.
It has also instructed people to stay at home, and stopped dining-in services at restaurants.
More than 90% of Macau's residents have received two doses of Covid vaccines. It's unclear how many have also received their booster doses, but the city is facing the fast-spreading Omicron variant for the first time.
In recent weeks, officials have set up a makeshift hospital and turned several casino resorts into medical facilities, as the former Portuguese colony only has one public hospital serving more than 600,000 residents.
mass tested residents and locked down apartment buildings and hotels where infections were found. 
Macau follows China's strict ""zero Covid"" strategy, where even handful of cases have led to mass testing, forced quarantine and lockdowns of neighbourhoods and even cities.  
While Macau has not imposed the type of city-wide lockdown seen in mainland China, it's virtually closed as most services have been halted.
rry Ng, an equity research analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong, told the BBC that Macau authorities were ""stuck between a rock and a hard place"".
""Because mainland Chinese tourists accounted for 71% of all tourists and more than 90% of gross gaming revenue, they have to duly follow mainland China's zero-Covid policy which is highly restrictive,"" he said.
Gambling is illegal in mainland China but is allowed in Macau, which like Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China.
Macau casino shares slipped on Monday as the restrictions kicked into effect.
Shares in Sands China, a subsidiary of casino giant Las Vegas Sands, were trading 7% lower by mid-day in Hong Kong. That of SJM Holdings, which was founded by the late Hong Kong tycoon Stanley Ho, fell by 6.1%.

technology	Why Donald Trump isn't returning to Twitter (for now)	"Donald Trump loves Twitter. 
In 2017, he said he wouldn't have become president without it. 
""Twitter is a wonderful thing for me, because I get the word out… I might not be here talking to you right now as president if I didn't have an honest way of getting the word out,"" he said. 
After Twitter's new owner Elon Musk reversed Mr Trump's permanent suspension, you might have thought the former president would jump at the chance to come back. But so far, he hasn't taken up that offer. 
Why?
Well, only Donald Trump knows the answer to that question for sure.
But what we do know is he has a lot of money to lose from tweeting. 
""The simplest explanation is the most likely - it's about money,"" says Josh Tucker, professor of politics at New York University (NYU). 
After Donald Trump was kicked off Twitter, he created his own social media platform called Truth Social - that looks an awful lot like Twitter. 
understand the financial bind Donald Trump is in, you have to understand the complex nature of Truth Social's business set up. 
Last year, the private company that owns Truth Social, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), announced its intention to merge with a shell company trading on the stock exchange called Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC).
DWAC is what's known as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (Spac).  Spacs are hyped as a way to speed up the often slow process of taking a private company public. In simple terms, it means merging a company that isn't on a stock exchange with one that is. 
Both TMTG and DWAC have agreed to merge, though the deal has not yet been completed. But that hasn't stopped investors piling money into DWAC - all of them speculating that the deal will go through. The shell company is currently valued at more than $800m (£665m). 
Considering DWAC would only be acquiring about a quarter of TMTG, Mr Trump's newly merged company would be worth at least $3-4bn, says Michael Ohlrogge, an academic specialising in Spacs. 
""He would own the vast majority. He would own probably 70 or 80% of it."" 
If it all goes through, it would make this business venture one of the most successful of Donald Trump's career. 
But the key to keeping stock value high is making sure that the former president stays on Truth Social - and exclusively so. 
It's hard to see what Truth Social has going for it without Donald Trump. The social media company was created by him. Why should even his supporters use the platform if he is posting elsewhere? 
ruth Social is already struggling to attract users. Analytics firm Similar Web estimates the platform had eight million site visits in September 2022 - down from 11.5 million in July. For a social media company, that is tiny. 
Similar Web estimates that Twitter had nine billion site visits in September.
If Donald Trump were to stop posting, or do it elsewhere, he could potentially tank the share price of DWAC, wiping hundreds of millions of dollars off its value. 
So important was Donald Trump's exclusivity with Truth Social to the proposed merger with DWAC, that a legal provision was placed in the agreement. 
It states that ""President Trump is generally obligated to make any social media post on Truth Social and may not make the same post on another social media site for 6 hours."" 
It means that not only could Donald Trump lose a lot of money by using Twitter (by spooking investors) but he could also get sued. 
""It's hard to say for sure who would win, but it wouldn't be a completely crazy suit to try to bring,"" says Ohlrogge.
It means Donald Trump is now in a quandary. He might want to go back to Twitter. But he is financially - not to mention legally - incentivised not to.
re are, however, other factors at play that could lead to him tweeting once more. 
For starters, DWAC's share price has behaved in very strange ways recently. 
Rather than it simply being a place where people can de facto invest in Truth Social, people have been purchasing DWA shares as a way of investing in the former president himself. 
""It's a meme stock,"" says Michael Klausner, Professor of Law at Stanford University. Meme stocks are companies that have lots of small investors who are online or social media followers, who can drive the share price up and down. 
Klausner says many who have invested in DWAC are Mr Trump's own supporters. 
""They think that Trump's name attached to something is going to be valuable,"" he says. 
It means DWAC's share price goes up when Donald Trump's fortunes are on the rise, and down when they are taking a turn for the worse. 
On Monday 7 November, it surged after reports emerged that he planned to run for president in 2024. But nine days later, when he finally confirmed the news in a speech that was criticised as ""low energy"" - the stock price fell.
ry here is that although DWAC is merging with Truth Social, what it's really doing is giving Donald Trump an opportunity to float himself - his personal brand - on the stock exchange. If that is the case, it wouldn't matter so much if Mr Trump were to stop using Truth Social - as the social media company is only a proxy for the man himself. 
For Josh Tucker from NYU, the situation raises interesting moral questions. 
""I have never personally heard of something like this before - that there is a large amount of money tracking what seems to be the political fortunes of a politician."" 
He warns that a politician might go on to make decisions based not on what is good for their political aspirations, but their financial ones instead. 
""If you're a Republican, you might want your Republican nominee to use the media to the best of their ability,"" he says. 
ucker argues that if Republicans were to elect Donald Trump as their presidential nominee, they would expect him to utilise wider social media in campaigning - rather than just limiting himself to one platform for financial gain. 
But Donald Trump may have anticipated this problem. Buried in the merger agreement there is another provision that allows him to use other social media platforms for ""political messaging"". 
It may be a ""loophole"", says Klausner, that would allow Trump to tweet without breaching the contract. 
Not only that, but Mr Trump is only bound by the agreement to post exclusively on Truth Social until July 2023, says Ohlrogge.
""My reading is after that point [legally] he'd be able post directly on Twitter, without posting first on Truth Social,"" he says.
re is another reason to think Donald Trump might come back onto Twitter. The merger itself is currently under Federal investigation. 
uld still fall through, at which point Donald Trump's legal commitment to post exclusively on Truth Social would also be ripped up. 
Mr Trump might lose money, but it would open the door still wider for a Twitter return. 
As with many of Mr Trump's financial affairs, it's complicated. And Donald Trump is not a person who is easy to predict. 
But what we do know is that were he to stick with Truth Social exclusively, and complete the Spac merger, he would likely earn a small fortune. 
It's hard to see how that's not a major factor in his thinking. Will that calculation change as we get closer to an election? 
It may well do. But for now, Mr Trump says he's staying put.

ually received treatment in the 2021-22 financial year.
NHS Borders said it had experienced ""considerable staffing shortages"" compounded by the availability of suitably qualified clinicians and was currently recruiting more nurses.
It also emerged that, as of June 8 of this year, another patient in Lanarkshire had waited 1,073 days and had not yet received treatment. It is not known if the child in question has since been treated.
figures also showed 176 children were waiting two years - as of 8 June - to be treated by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) across the country.
Of these, 76 were in the NHS Highland board area, 70 in Lanarkshire and 30 in the Forth Valley health board region.
Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: ""It is shocking to learn that children and young people are waiting three years to be seen for the mental health treatment they need. This must feel like a lifetime.
""These figures should weight heavy on the shoulders of the health secretary because they show that the current system simply isn't working.""
He added: ""For years, this SNP government has told us about their commitment to mental health but there is very little evidence that this is anything other than bluster.
""Staff are doing their best but there is nowhere near enough resources or early interventions.""
Mr Cole-Hamilton has pushed for a mental health first aider to be available at all phases of education, as well as counsellors available to pupils in all schools.
A spokesperson for NHS Borders said: ""While the number of patients seen by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in the Borders within the 18-week target is far from what we would wish for, we have and continue to work hard to improve our waiting times.
""We have experienced considerable staffing shortages which were compounded by the availability of suitably qualified CAMHS clinicians.""
kesperson added that the health board was actively recruiting nurses and once those posts were filled it would reduce its waiting times significantly, seeing those who had been waiting the longest first.
: ""Further improvement work is well under way such as putting in place a stakeholder reference group and developing pathways and processes to meet the CAMHS standards."" 
Ross McGuffie, chief officer of North Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Partnership, said: ""Providing mental health support to children and young people is a priority and CAMHS teams across Lanarkshire are working hard to see children and young people as quickly as possible.
""There are already a range of services for children and young people which offer support and ongoing treatment including the development of a new CAMHS facility at Udston in South Lanarkshire. 
""This new facility is in addition to the other two CAMHS centres in North Lanarkshire, one in Coatbridge and one in Motherwell as well as outreach clinics in each local area.""
He added that an extra 59 staff had been added to its CAMHS service recently using the Scottish government's Recovery and Renewal Funding.
He said: ""We have new teams already in place supporting an extensive waiting list initiative clinic that has reduced the waiting list by 20% over the last 12 weeks.
""However, we recognise that the pandemic has played a major role in increased waiting times and as well as the developments above we are looking at other ways of reducing waiting times so children and young people get the support they need as quickly as possible.""

politics	Rishi Sunak thanks public servants with surprise Christmas calls	"Rishi Sunak has surprised public servants working across the world over Christmas with a personal phone call to thank them for their efforts. 
Instead of a traditional message to the nation, the PM called diplomats, Royal Navy crew and a childcare provider in Pakistan, Somalia, Ukraine and the UK. 
Mr Sunak said he was grateful for their ""sacrifice"" over the festive period.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used his message to pay tribute to the Ukrainian people and those working at Christmas.
In the UK, Mr Sunak spoke to Chris Mitchell, who runs Smart Play, a government-funded holiday activities and food programme in Barnet, north London. 
rime minister also called Svita Yavorska, who works for the UK's embassy in Ukraine. She told Mr Sunak how she had fled to Poland, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, helping to set up a temporary base there, before returning to the city of Lviv in western Ukraine. 
Speaking to diplomat Nic Guffog, who is based in Mogadishu, Mr Sunak heard how staff at the UK's diplomatic compound were living in containers under the threat of terror attacks, as they supported the Somalian government to counter the militant Al-Shabaab group and deal with the hunger crisis facing the country. 
He also spoke to some of the crew of HMS Protector, which is currently deployed off the coast of the South Sandwich islands in Antarctica. 
It comes as the UK is facing a wave of industrial action, including by NHS and Border Force staff, with members of the armed forces stepping in to cover striking workers.
Although Mr Sunak did not follow the tradition of recording a Christmas message that is broadcast to the UK, he did issue a statement.
Mr Sunak said: ""Whether you are working in Mogadishu or Milton Keynes this Christmas, I want you to know that I am personally grateful for your sacrifice. 
""This year has been an extraordinary year for so many reasons, but most of all, it's been a year in which the true spirit and resilience of the United Kingdom has been on show, from the support given to our Ukrainian friends, to the work being done to ensure essential aid reaches the most vulnerable overseas.
""And closer to home, those who have checked on friends and neighbours, volunteers, public servants and essential service staff all working over Christmas - I am truly humbled by your dedication and I know your selflessness this festive season will spread cheer across the country."" 
Mr Sunak also tweeted a short video to the people of Ukraine, writing: ""This Christmas, we're with you...""
And in a Christmas message on Twitter, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the prime minister and British public, saying he was ""grateful"" for their support and ""warmth of your hearts"".
In his annual Christmas message, Labour's leader acknowledged that for many people in Britain ""life is tough at the moment"". 
""But Christmas is a reminder that we will endure, that things will get better,"" Sir Keir Starmer added. 
""I hope this Christmas is a joyous and relaxing time for you, however you are spending it. I'm looking forward to sharing my time with my family, away from the day to day of work,"" he said. 
""But as I do I will be keeping in my heart all those who are working to keep us safe. Those looking after the less fortunate, and our friends in Ukraine, facing the horror of Putin's appalling attacks. Their struggle for freedom inspires us all.""
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon used her festive message to offer a ""heartfelt thanks"" to public sector workers and noted ""tough times"" for Scotland.
She said: ""Especially after the past two Christmases, I know most of us will be really looking forward to this festive period.
""Of course, the cost-of-living crisis is making this a very hard winter for many. So this Christmas, it's important for all of us to also think about how we can help others.""
In his message, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""For me, the message of Christmas is for us to treat others as we would wish to be treated and the symbol of Christmas is light - the light of hope, in the darkest week of the year. 
""Hope that we all desperately need for these most challenging of times."""	/news/uk-politics-64079793
health	Staying warm: What does an unheated room do to your body?	"Mention deadly cold and I think of polar explorers with icicles dangling from their beards and mountaineers tackling the heights of Everest; of fingers turning black with frostbite and the chilling clutch of hypothermia. 
So I was sceptical when I was asked to take part in a cold experiment that took place at just 10 degrees Celsius. Yes, 10C.
me that's mild, nowhere near freezing and certainly no Arctic blast. Surely we'd have to go much colder before putting a strain on the body? I was wrong.
""It sounds mild, but it is a real physiological challenge,"" Prof Damian Bailey, from the University of South Wales, tells me. 
He's invited me to his laboratory to explore the impact of cold homes on our bodies and why such seemingly mild temperatures can become deadly. 
""Ten degrees is the average temperature that people will be living in, if they can't afford to heat their homes,"" said Prof Bailey.
And as I was about to find out, 10C has a profound impact on the heart, lungs and brain. 
I'm led into the environmental chamber in the corner of the laboratory - it's all shiny metal walls and thick, heavy doors. In this air-tight room, scientists can precisely set the temperature, humidity and oxygen levels. 
I'm hit with a blast of warm 21C air. The plan is to start at 21C, drop the temperature down to 10C and chart how my body responds to the chill. 
First, I am wired up to countless state-of-the-art gizmos for the most in-depth analysis my body has ever faced.
My chest, arms and legs are dotted with monitors to track my body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure.
""You will look like something out of Star Wars,"" says Prof Bailey as another sensor and trailing cable is attached to my body. 
A headset is fitted to monitor the blood flow in my brain just as the first beads of sweat breakout on my brow; an ultrasound inspects the carotid arteries in my neck (hearing the rhythmic whoosh of blood going to my brain is oddly reassuring) and I breathe into a huge tube that analyses the air I exhale. 
measurements are done. The scientists know how my body performs in a pleasant 21C. So the fans kick in and a cool breeze gradually lowers the temperature in the chamber. 
""Your brain is tasting your blood as we speak and it's tasting the temperature and the brain is now sending signals to the rest of your body,"" Prof Bailey tells me. 
goal is to keep my core - that's my major organs including my heart and liver - at around 37C.
I was still unaware of the profound changes happening inside my body, but there were already clues on the outside. 
By the time the room has dropped to 18C I was no longer sweating and the hairs on my arms were starting to stand up to help insulate my body. 
""Science tells us that 18 degrees is the tipping point... the body is now working to defend that core temperature,"" Prof Bailey shouts over the droning fans.
Next my fingers turn white and they feel cold. The blood vessels in my hands are being closed off - known as vasoconstriction - in order to keep my warm blood for my critical organs.
would happen even more quickly if I were a different sex. 
""Women do tend to feel the cold more, because of hormones (oestrogen) their blood vessels in their hands and feet are more likely to constrict... and that makes us feel cold,"" says Dr Clare Eglin from the University of Portsmouth.
My first shiver kicks in at 11.5C as my muscles begin to shake to generate heat.
At 10C the fans shut down. I'm feeling uncomfortable, but not freezing as we repeated all the bodily measurements again at the lower temperature and it soon became clear I was wrong to doubt that 10C would affect me. 
""The body is working jolly hard at 10 degrees,"" says Prof Bailey.
What shocks me is the change in blood flow to the brain and how much longer it takes me to complete a shape-sorting game.
I wouldn't want to be trying to do school homework in a cold room or to have this compound something like dementia.
""You're delivering less blood to the brain, so there's less oxygen and less glucose [sugar] getting into the brain and the downside of that is it's having a negative impact on your mental gymnastics,"" Prof Bailey says.
But my body is achieving its main goal of keeping my core body temperature stable - it's just having to do more work. 
I'm pumping warm blood around my body more intensely with my heart beating faster and blood pressure also shooting up. 
""That increasing blood pressure is a risk factor for a stroke, it's a risk factor for a heart attack,"" Prof Bailey tells me.
f is also changing ""so it becomes a bit like treacle"", says Prof Bailey, and this thicker gloopier blood also adds to the risk of a dangerous blockage.
It's why heart attacks and strokes are more common in the winter. 
Fortunately, I started off with ""fabulous vasculature"", Prof Bailey tells me, but these internal changes are a risk to those who already have poor heart health and the elderly. 
""The evidence clearly suggests that cold is more deadly than the heat, there are a higher number of deaths caused through cold snaps than there are through the heat snaps,"" says Prof Bailey.
""So I really do think that more recognition needs to be paid for the dangers associated with cold.""
g hand to many infections that thrive in the winter months such as flu. Pneumonia, when there is inflammation in the lungs because of an infection, is more common after cold weather. 
It is easier for viruses to spread because we're more likely to meet up indoors with the windows shut and no fresh air to blow viruses away. 
Cold also makes it easier for viruses to survive outside the body and cold air contains less virus-trapping moisture. 
Dry air allows viruses to travel further distances, says Prof Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiologist from Yale University. She has also performed experiments showing breathing in cold air affects how the immune system works in the nose.
Prof Iwasaki tells me: ""At these cooler temperatures, your immune response becomes less active and this can allow virus to grow better within your nose.""
In an ideal world we'd all heat the room we're in to at least 18C. When that is not possible, Prof Bailey says ""it's like preparing for a mountaineering expedition"".

technology	Could hydrogen ease Germany's reliance on Russian gas?	"war in Ukraine has upended Germany's energy policy.
Since the start of the war Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian oil from 35% to 12% and on Russian gas from 55% to 35%.
Nevertheless, energy trading is a huge source of revenue for Moscow. Over the first two months of the war Germany paid almost €9bn (£7.7bn; $9.6bn) for Russian oil and gas imports according to the Finnish thinktank CREA.
Veronika Grimm is an economics professor at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, and currently one of Germany's three special advisors to the federal government, called Economic Sages.
""We need to diversify and decarbonise our energy sources faster than initially planned,"" she says. To help achieve that goal, Ms Grimm wants the nation to ""ramp-up"" its use of hydrogen.
Hydrogen can store vast amounts of energy, replace natural gas in industrial processes, and power fuel cells in trucks, trains, ships or planes that emit nothing but vapour of drinkable water.
Ms Grimm's enthusiasm is gaining traction, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), an energy research group, dozens of countries have published national hydrogen strategies, or are about to.
Despite this flurry of interest, it's not clear yet that the large-scale use of hydrogen can be made viable.
After all, there has been similar excitement before: in the 1970s, after two oil crises, and in the 1990s, when climate worries arose. But both petered out. So, is today's hype any different?
Sceptics warn that industry representatives, who globally dominate most hydrogen councils, are often biased in favour of hydrogen as it promises subsidies and keeps up demand for existing assets such as pipelines, tankers, turbines or boilers. 
rgue that politicians like big, green-sounding plans for a more distant future rather than more difficult solutions. 
While small amounts of hydrogen are being extracted directly from the ground, most hydrogen is manufactured. That is largely done in two ways, each marked by a colour code.
Green hydrogen is produced by using electricity from renewable power to split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules using an electrolyser. But those machines and the electricity to run them remain costly.
means that, at the moment, such emission-free hydrogen makes up only 0.03% of global hydrogen production, according to the IEA.
Up to five times cheaper is so-called grey hydrogen, this is derived from natural gas, or in some cases from oil or coal. But due to losses during production, about 50% more CO2 is emitted than if natural gas were directly burned.
A related technique is known as blue hydrogen. This relies on the same process, but captures about 60-90% of the carbon emitted in production for re-use or storage.
rawback with this method is that it roughly doubles the cost and lacks production facilities at large scale. So only 0.7% of globally-produced hydrogen is blue.
So, despite its environmentally-friendly image and potential, the global production of hydrogen currently emits almost three times as much CO2 as a whole country, France, for instance.
Much then will hinges on how countries decide to produce hydrogen.
Some countries already have a clear priority - to power electrolysers most sun-baked nations bet on solar power, while France relies on nuclear energy.
China meanwhile cherishes cheap grey hydrogen from coal and gas and invests in green alternatives.
US, Canada, UK, Netherlands and Norway are leading the push for blue hydrogen, by injecting captured carbon into oil and gas fields for long-term storage, or for so-called enhanced oil recovery that boosts extraction.
In Germany, however, the picture is less clear. 
Volker Quaschning, professor for renewable energy systems at Berlin's University of Applied Sciences and criticises Germany's hydrogen strategy: ""Merkel's government used it as a red herring to conceal its own failures in the energy transition.""
He argues that solar and wind power should have been expanded faster to facilitate future green hydrogen production - a step that Germany's new government has promised to take.
However, on hydrogen the three parties in the governing coalition, the three responsible ministries, and the hydrogen council all internally argue whether to concentrate on green hydrogen, or to accept the blue alternative, to temporarily bridge the gap in limited supply. 
Ms Grimm represents the majority view on the hydrogen council in favouring a multi-colour mix.
""Accepting blue hydrogen will help create the supply that we need for a budding industry,"" she argues. ""It will foster technological breakthroughs in Germany and encourage potential suppliers to invest in green hydrogen production.""
In January, Economy Minister Robert Habeck announced an ambitious push for renewables and a doubling of the two-year old target for domestic production capacity of green hydrogen to rise by a factor of 150 from 70 MW today to 10 GW by 2030. 
rget represents a quarter of the entire EU's aim of 40GW, and is larger than France's goal of 6.5 GW.
So while this domestic production expands, Germany is looking to source hydrogen from abroad.
Andreas Kuhlmann, head of the German Energy Agency, (a government-owned company facilitating the energy transition coordinating the Hydrogen Council), says Germany has dramatically sped-up international negotiations to buy hydrogen.
uld include developing hydrogen pipelines to connect to southern Europe, where favourable conditions for solar and wind power allow the cost-efficient production of hydrogen. 
Mr Habeck is frantically visiting energy exporters. Within one week in March, he travelled to Norway to agree on a feasibility study for the construction of a hydrogen pipeline, went to Qatar to finalise an energy partnership and visited the United Arab Emirates to sign five cooperation agreements.
first deliveries from the UAE are expected to arrive later this year.
Other countries on Mr Habeck's hydrogen radar are Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Chile, Namibia and Australia.
ugh he acknowledges the need to import hydrogen, Mr Quaschning dashes some of Mr Habeck's hopes. ""Importing hydrogen from desert plants will be sluggish, inefficient and expensive,"" he explains.
Each step in the supply chain uses up some of the original energy: desalinating sea water to get fresh water as raw material, electrolysis, liquification for shipping, transport via tanker, local transport via pipeline in Germany and re-conversion of hydrogen into electricity.
""Together, these steps would eat up at least 70% of the electricity originally produced in the desert,"" Mr Quaschning says.
""So, even though a solar panel in the desert produces 80% more electricity than one in Germany, the losses on the way are so big, that it would be twice as effective to directly produce solar power in Germany.""
Due to its high-cost, hydrogen is often referred to as the champagne of the energy transition. So, who will get the first sips?
On this, most observers agree. ""It is crucial that we allocate hydrogen only to those industries, where direct electrification is not possible"", explains Felix Matthes energy expert at Öko-Institut, a think tank, and member of Germany's hydrogen council.
""So, we should first use it in the production of steel, chemicals and glass,"" he argues.
Subsequent sectors could be shipping, long distance truck transport, as well as planes for medium or long distances. Other uses in cars or heating are inefficient, costly and impractical distractions, he adds.
""Plus, Mr Habeck's new push for renewables will create a greater need to balance our electricity supply, which hydrogen could do with electrolysers producing hydrogen on sunny, windy days as large-scale storage for cloudy winter days,"" Mr Matthes says.
ressure is on Germany to stop spending so much on Russian energy, but it will be a tricky process.
Many will be hoping that hydrogen eases that transition by fulfilling its promise this time around.

sports	CrossFit Games: Northern Ireland girl dubbed world's fittest teen after win	"A 15-year-old girl from Newtownards has been dubbed the world's fittest teenager after taking gold at the World CrossFit Games. 
Lucy McConigle secured the win for her age group at the event in Madison, Wisconsin last weekend.
She then went on to win two bronze medals at the European Youth Weightlifting Championships in Poland this week.
Her training regime covers a broad range of high-intensity disciplines.
CrossFit Games is an annual competition in which athletes are scored across a number of demanding exercises, such as weightlifting, burpees and pull-ups.
xercise regime was created by American Greg Glassman and there more than 15,000 CrossFit-affiliated gyms across 160 countries.
who win at the CrossFit Games are given the label of world's fittest, with Lucy the latest to join those ranks. 
Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster, Lucy explained the variety of training required.
""CrossFit is basically every sport mushed into one. There's gymnastics, running, biking... a whole load of high intensity interval-style training is what I do.
""I also do running, swimming, paddle boarding, weightlifting - (they) would be the main elements,"" she added.
was Lucy's first time winning gold at the competition, having been awarded a silver medal last year.
""I'm proud after I know all the effort that's gone into it. I feel like it's good to finally compete and get the title I thought I deserved,"" she said.
Lucy developed an interest in CrossFit from a young age, having previously been a keen swimmer, and is currently supported by her coach, Sam Duckett.
""From ten-years-old I recognised how good she was... probably from when Lucy was thirteen-and-a-half she also recognised how good she was, she won't admit it,"" he said.
Mr Duckett praised Lucy's talent in taking his feedback and being able to ""pick up things straight away"" as well as her willingness to push through a ""deep, dark cave"" of pain.
""Being very adaptable is key, the ability to learn really quickly - that's massive because there's so many disciplines and elements to it.
""It's the ability to work on your own for three, four hours a day and to be able to suffer pain more than the next person beside you who is also trying to be the fittest person in the world,"" he said.
""I think because I started when I was so young, it's always been that way, I haven't really had a chance to question it or think twice about it, I think it just comes naturally [dealing with pain],"" Lucy added. 
Having secured two medals at this year's European Youth Weightlifting Championships, in which she deadlifted 148kg, Mr Duckett is anticipating further success for Lucy.
""She's on that pathway with the Great British weightlifting team, towards competing in the Olympics someday. Our aim is to get her to compete as an individual."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-62589123

politics	Labour questions PPE contract award and Baroness Mone links	"Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner has accused the government of a ""total failure of due diligence"" and a ""conflict of interest"" when it awarded contracts to get personal protective equipment from a company called PPE Medpro.
PPE Medpro won government contracts worth £203m during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Guardian has published allegations based on leaked documents that Conservative peer Michelle Mone financially benefitted from the company.
Glasgow-born businesswoman, who joined the House of Lords in 2015, has been previously linked to PPE Medpro. 
Emails released under Freedom of Information laws show her referring the company to a government minister during the pandemic.  
Baroness Mone is being investigated by the House of Lords Standards Commissioner in connection to PPE Medpro. Properties linked to the company have previously been searched by the National Crime Agency. 
Referencing the Guardian story during an urgent question in the House of Commons, Ms Rayner said it appeared ""tens of millions of pounds"" from the money awarded to the company ""ended up in offshore accounts connected to the individuals involved"".
In response, Health Minister Neil O'Brien told MPs it had been widely reported PPE Medpro had an ""underperforming contract"" and the government could claim for damages, which can be followed by litigation if an agreement isn't reached. 
He said a satisfactory agreement had not been reached with PPE Medpro yet. He also stressed the urgency of securing supplies of PPE during the pandemic. 
At the time, he said, the government was operating under ""extraordinary circumstances"" to quickly get PPE to the frontline.
Medpro has previously said that its gowns passed technical inspection and met the contractual requirements.
Baroness Mone has previously told the BBC through her lawyers she never had any role or function in the company, or in the process in which contracts were awarded. "	/news/63746930

health	East Midlands Ambulance Service workers begin strike action over pay	"East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) workers have begun strike action as part of a national pay dispute with the government.
24-hour action from ambulance staff across most of England and Wales on Wednesday is expected to affect non life-threatening calls only.
In the East Midlands, the action by the GMB union - which started at 06:00 GMT - will involve up to 50% of staff.
EMAS said it would aim to minimise the impact of strike action on patients.
means patients who have non life-threatening conditions will have to wait longer for an ambulance.
NHS said ""where safe and appropriate"", those people might be asked to make their own way to hospital, but should seek advice from 111 or 999 before doing so. 
rike will end at 06:00 on Thursday, and is set to continue from 06:00 on 28 December, to 06:00 on 29 December.
Ferdousara Uddin, regional organiser from GMB, said: ""It's not just about pay. It's about understaffing and the cuts being made that put patients at risk.
""The ambulance services are running at deeply unsafe levels and under extreme pressure every day.
""We need action from the government and proper investment into the service.""
Ms Uddin added: ""You can see and hear for yourself - it's been fantastic. We've had people stopping to speak to the ambulance workers to show their support.
""They've dropped off food, or just to have a chat"". 
Melissa Farrell, 36, a paramedic on the picket line in Lincoln, said: ""On Friday night I was on the back of an ambulance outside Lincoln A&E for seven hours followed by nine-and-a-half hours on Saturday night.
""It's about better working conditions for staff and for the public.
""We want to help the public and at the moment our hands are tied while we're stuck outside A&E. We're unable to get to those who truly need us. 
""We are here in the event of a real emergency, but at the moment we're overloaded with going to things which could be helped by other means.""
Her colleague Ellie Flinton, 30, said: ""There's a national shortage of nurses, paramedics, healthcare workers and we want the pay to be attractive so that people want to come into this job.
""We want our pay to be representative of what we do so people want to stay as well.
""In my opinion there are lives being put at risk every single day because of the way the service is currently running.""
One paramedic based in Nottinghamshire told PA News that patients' lives had been at risk ""longer than these strikes were even considered"".
m, 33, who did not want to provide his last name, said: ""I've attended elderly patients who have been on the floor with broken hips for over 20 hours.
""They've been waiting that long that their limbs have started to become necrotic (dying tissue), resulting in major surgery to remove said limbs.""
""In 14 hours I saw and attended one patient of my own and did not have a break... And there were, at one point, 11 ambulances stuck at (the) hospital unable to be freed back onto the road.
""The conditions we work in on a regular basis don't enable us to do the job we want to do to its full capacity and is putting patients' lives at risk long before strikes were even considered.
""We regularly go 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 hours without a break or even so much as a brew or any warm food, or food at all, due to these delays.""
""The ambulance service striking is one that has very little bearing on the grand scheme of things but hopefully has a big influence on highlighting the already failing NHS we so desperately need to treasure and invest in."" 
By Rob Sissons, BBC East Midlands Today health correspondent 
Another day, another strike. On Wednesday, it is the turn of ambulance workers and at England's second biggest ambulance trust.
re is a degree of apprehension about how the day will pan out. It is the GMB union that is striking with hundreds of members across many grades of staff from ambulance paramedics to call handlers. The ambulance service has always been about managing risk triaging 999 calls - those risks increase dramatically when a swathe of staff are missing on strike. 
GMB union says relations with the trust are good and they will liaise across the day. If there is a life-threatening emergency and no nearby ambulances, some strikers could be asked to come back to work. 
All disputes eventually come to an end but in the case of NHS workers, it feels like we in so many ways are stuck at the beginning. The government insists the pay claims are unaffordable in the current economic context. 
All sides are fighting for the hearts and minds of the public.
government has said it stands by a pay offer recommended by the independent pay review body and has criticised how the strike has been organised.
East Midlands Ambulance Service is made up of more than 4,000 workers represented by the GMB, Unison and Unite unions.
Unison has 1,296 staff at EMAS - made up of the likes of paramedics, technicians, call centre staff and mechanics.
Its members are not striking as the BBC understands they were 40 votes short of meeting the 50% threshold for action. 
New ballot papers for its members will be issued in the new year.
Ben Holdaway, director of operations at EMAS, said: ""During the period of the dispute, we will do all we can to minimise the impact on patient safety and will continue to work very closely with trade union colleagues, regional service providers and NHS employers.
""Patients should continue to call for an ambulance as normal if they experience a life-threatening emergency and should continue to access other more appropriate services for any other illnesses or injuries.
""We fully respect the right of NHS staff to take lawful and peaceful industrial action, however we do urge national employer representatives and trade union colleagues to proactively engage and reach a negotiated settlement to the dispute as quickly as possible.""
mes as a ""critical incident"" was declared across Nottinghamshire, due to high demand for hospital services. 
Operations have been cancelled, with nurses across the country also walking out on Tuesday.

health	'NHS is broken' say striking ambulance staff in West	"Ambulance workers in the West are striking in a dispute over pay and working conditions.
Picket lines have formed in Bristol, Somerset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire on Wednesday.
Disruption is expected to be extensive and NHS leaders have warned that patient safety is at risk.
Ambulances will be responding to life-threatening situations but people are asked to only call 999 in life-threatening situations.
Paramedics, control room staff and support workers, who are members of the Unison, GMB and Unite unions, are striking across much of England and Wales.
Unions representing ambulance workers want pay increases to keep up with the rising cost of living. They have not set a specific figure but argue any offer needs to be high enough to prevent a recruitment crisis.
However, ministers say they will not negotiate on pay as they have met independent pay recommendations.
Chris Hewett, paramedic and Unison member, was at the picket line in Filton. He said: ""It's been a relatively quiet morning, we're at a third of our normal 999 level.
""So it means the public are supporting us and looking after themselves and find other ways of caring themselves other than calling 999.""
Wednesday's strike comes after South Western Ambulance Service declared a critical incident on Tuesday, after they had more than 700 calls waiting to be dispatched. 
Mr Hewett said: ""When I came on shift yesterday there were over 750 999 calls that we had not been able to get ambulances to across the region. 
""That's a normal day - it's quieter today because people are aware of the strike but it shows that the NHS is broken and the ambulance service is crippled by a lack of funding and a real recruitment and retention crisis.""
rmed forces have been drafted in to help manage any impact of today's strike with about two dozen army medics brought in to help South Western Ambulance Service, according to Mr Hewett. 
ramedic said wages have gone down 20 per cent in real terms and Unison members were prepared to keep going with strike action. 
""What we're saying to people, if they need us, then dial 999 and someone will come and help,"" he said.
NHS bosses in Somerset have also warned today services are under ""extreme pressure"" not just due to strikes but due to a combination of cold weather, concerns about Strep A infections, and an increase in Flu.
Bernie Marden, chief medical officer, NHS Somerset said: ""Regardless of any industrial action taking place, it is important that patients who need urgent medical care continue to come forward.""
Connor Calby, a paramedic who works across Bristol and Somerset said to BBC Radio Bristol that staff were struggling to pay their energy bills and with the wider cost of living crisis. 
Unison member said staff had been put in a ""very difficult"" position over striking.
He said: ""We all joined this profession because we wanted to make a difference to people and make sure they got the best care and none of us took it lightly.
""In the South West 85.6 per cent of us were in favour of strike action and I think that says volumes about how everyone feels at the moment."" 
Chris Nelson, Gloucestershire Police and Crime Commissioner said the sheer demand on the ambulance services has led to resources being lost from police. 
He said: ""Over the last six months we have had a lot more involvement with NHS-related issues where our partners can't meet their demand. 
""On average we have 50 or so calls a day in the force control room about ambulance-related issues to do with concerns for welfare.""
Mr Nelson gave an example of an incident last week where police had to convey an elderly man to hospital after a fall on the ice which left him with a suspected hip and leg injury. The waiting time for an ambulance to arrive was estimated to be six hours. 
Four police units, meaning at least four officers but possibly eight, attended along with and a fire unit which could have had four to five fire officers.
Police and the fire officers spent two hours asking for an ambulance to attend, Mr Nelson said. 
Eventually they took the man to hospital on a stretcher at the request of ambulance service but were then turned away from Cheltenham Hospital and told to go to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. 
Mr Nelson added he was ""sympathetic"" to those striking over low pay.
Further strike action is planned on 28 December and concerns have been raised over its impact considering it comes after four bank holidays. 
Not all unions are striking for the same hours of Wednesday. And it is difficult to say how many workers are striking at each individual service. In some areas, such as the East of England, there is no current plan to strike.

Killing Me Softly with His Song performer is also having difficulty speaking, her manager said on Monday.
Flack, 85, has won four Grammy awards and received 14 nominations. 
A documentary about her life is set to have its premiere next week in New York. She also has plans to publish a children's book in January. 
In addition to Killing Me Softly - which was later covered by the Fugees - Flack is known for songs including The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, which launched her to stardom after it was used in Clint Eastwood film Play Misty for Me, and Feel Like Makin' Love. 
Her condition - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease - ""has made it impossible to sing and not easy to speak,"" her management said in a statement. 
""But it will take a lot more than ALS to silence this icon,"" they said, adding that she ""plans to stay active in her musical and creative pursuits"".
re is no known cure for ALS, which is caused by the death of the nerves that carry messages from the brain to people's muscles. It affects their ability to move, talk and even breathe.
ming of Flack's film and book release next year coincide with the 50th anniversary of her fourth album Killing Me Softly With His Song, which was released in 1973.
After the singer suffered a stroke in 2016, she told the Associated Press news agency that wants her songs to be remembered as ""classics"" and and not just an ""old hit"".
""I could sing any number of songs that I've recorded through the years, easily, I could sing them, but I'm going to pick those songs that move me,"" Flack said.

politics	Freezing week of strikes threaten Sunak's sober approach	"r of strikes is unremitting.
From health workers in Northern Ireland on Monday, to strikes involving nurses, posties, baggage handlers, bus drivers, road workers, driving test examiners and rail workers will happen between now and the weekend, as the nation gears up towards Christmas.
And with the cold weather and the pressure on purses caused by the cost-of-living crisis, events are now colliding with the new-ish government.
Later this week, Rishi Sunak will overtake Liz Truss in prime ministerial miles on the clock.
Wednesday will be his 51st day in office. Liz Truss managed 50.
And what a contrast between this autumn's two prime ministers.
russ administration was like a firework display, where every rocket, banger and Catherine Wheel went off at once.
By contrast, Mr Sunak has tried to make a virtue of a government with barely a sparkler between them.
re has been a quiet seriousness, and a determination to avoid going out of their way to pick fights, particularly with their own side.
I am told they have been preparing for this wave of strikes since day one in office, back in late October.
Now, while they still hope to resolve the disputes, it appears ministers are in mitigation mode.
government's emergency response committee, known as COBR, met on Monday and will do again on Wednesday.
Further such meetings will follow.
Over the weekend, the Department of Health put in what is known as a MACA request in the Whitehall jargon - Military Assistance for the Civil Authorities.
My understanding is several hundred military personnel will be recruited as ambulance drivers.
will have a five day training course, but I'm told this won't involve practicing driving with the blue lights flashing on the open road.
When they do do that, during a strike, they will be accompanied by non striking NHS staff.
It is expected that members of the military will wear their normal uniforms when they are filling in for strikers.
Army is providing 85% of the military support, but all of the armed services are involved.
It is perhaps this week that the full scale of the consequences of this industrial action will start to become clear.
Where significant chunks of both the services we rely on daily, and those we hope are always there if we need them, are not - or at least not as they usually are.
For some an inconvenience. For others, potentially dangerous. And politically important too.

entertainment	Adele says she'll study for an English Literature degree after Las Vegas shows	"Brit and Grammy-winner Adele wants to study for an English Literature degree once her upcoming Las Vegas residency has been completed.
During a Q&A session with fans in Los Angeles on Monday, she said: ""After Vegas I want to get a degree in English Literature.
""If I hadn't made it singing, I think I would be an English Lit teacher.""
34-year-old singer will play a belated run of dates at the Caesars Palace hotel, beginning next month. 
""I definitely think I use my passion for English lit in what I do. I wish I'd gone to university and had that experience, but I will do it online with a tutor.""
She continued: ""That's my plan for 2025, just to get the qualification"".
ws will be music to the ears of her old English teacher Ms McDonald, who had an emotional surprise reunion with the star on stage during a star-studded ITV UK comeback concert last year.
During An Audience with Adele, the singer was asked questions by celebrities inside the London Palladium, with Harry Potter and Love Actually actress Emma Thompson asking her who had inspired her when she was younger.
She replied with a story about Ms McDonald, saying: ""She was cool and so relatable and likeable, that I really looked forward to my English lessons.""
""She left in year eight but she got me really into literature, I've always been obsessed with English and obviously now I write lyrics,"" Adele explained.
""She was so cool, so engaging, and she really made us care, and we knew that she cared about us and stuff like that.""
rformer then got a shock when it was revealed Ms McDonald was in the audience and the teacher got up to join the singer on stage.
""You're amazing darling, I am so proud of you,"" she told Adele, bringing her to tears, so much so that she had to get her make-up fixed before carrying on with the show.
Adele graduated from the Brit School of Performing Arts & Technology before beginning her climb to the top of pop star career ladder.
Other stars who returned to their studies after finding fame
After postponing her widely discussed Las Vegas residency earlier this year to her fans' dismay, due to delivery delays and Covid, Adele - who now resides in LA and doesn't like touring - is finally set to perform in Sin City from next month.
Ahead of the shows, the singer this week released a new music video to accompany her (latest) soulful break-up ballad, I Drink Wine, taken from her fourth studio album - the biggest-selling album of 2021.
Joe Talbot-directed video finds her floating down a river in a rubber ring, while holding a glass of wine in one hand and an almost-empty wine bottle in the other.
r, wearing a glittery gold dress, is seen rolling her eyes at a happy looking couple before rather carelessly tossing the now-empty wine bottle into the river.
She performed the track at February's Brit Awards, where she won album of the year for 30 and single of the year for another track, Easy On Me.
Adele has had four number one albums, entitled 19, 21, 25 and 30.  
And if all goes well with her studies we might well expect a follow-up entitled 2.1… or maybe even 1st."	/news/entertainment-arts-63410119

McGuire also played 259 NRL games for Brisbane Broncos, North Queensland Cowboys and St George Illawarra.
""I didn't want to come over here too late in my career and make up numbers,"" McGuire told BBC Radio Merseyside.
""I wanted to be in the physical shape to provide a service to the club and the fans and play to a good level, and coming in here I feel really fit.

entertainment	Love Island's Sharon Gaffka urges spike victims to go to police	"A former Love Island contestant is urging victims of spiking to go to the police as partygoers gear up for the New Year. 
Sharon Gaffka, who was a victim of drink spiking herself, has been working with Thames Valley Police (TVP) ""trying to change society"".
Didcot-based social media influencer said her ""biggest regret"" was not reporting her case to police. 
New figures show there were almost 5,000 spiking cases over the last year.
National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) said it recorded 4,924 cases over the last 12 months to September - the majority split between needle and drink spiking.
A YouGov poll suggests 10% of British women have had a drink spiked and that nearly half of those aged between 18 and 24 (48%) said they have had a drink spiked or know someone who has.
Ms Gaffka, who appeared on the ITV show Love Island in 2021, said she was out with friends when her drink was spiked in 2020. 
""I turned round to one of my friends and said I didn't feel right and was found unconscious in the ladies' cubicle toilets,"" she told the BBC. 
An ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital but she took the incident no further. 
""Unfortunately, outside of my friendship group, I didn't feel I had anyone to turn to,"" she added.
""My biggest regret to this day is never reporting it to the police."" 
However, the reality show contestant told the BBC that since beginning her campaign with TVP ""there are things I could have done to get evidence"".
""We knew which was the last drink I had that might have been tampered with,"" she said.
""Obviously the drug can pass through your body very quickly but it would never leave that glass. 
""My friends were OK so they could have taken that glass and we could have gone to the police with it, but we didn't know that. That's something I know now.""
""I always get an increase of messages in my inbox telling me I was the one to blame,"" she continued.
""Regardless of what I was wearing it will never be my fault and it is never any victim's fault and that is something I am trying to change about society,"" she said. 
NPCC Deputy Chief Constable Maggie Blyth said: ""Spiking is a complex and challenging offence to investigate. 
""In order to have the best chance of identifying drugs and bringing offenders to justice, our message to anyone who thinks they have been spiked is to report early and be tested by the police.""

business	Queen's funeral: Heathrow cancels flights on Monday	"Heathrow Airport has said about 15% of its schedule will be altered on Monday during Queen Elizabeth's state funeral.
ure the skies over London fall quiet during the events, it said.
re will be flight cancellations as a result, including 100 British Airways flights and four Virgin Atlantic flights.
Separately tens of thousands of passengers are set to be affected by a French air traffic control strike on Friday.
Among the cancelled flights will be many that fly over France, not just to and from the country.
Heathrow said that all takeoffs and landings on Monday will be delayed for 15 minutes before and after the two-minute silence at the end of the funeral. 
Following that, there will be no arrivals between 13:45 BST and 14:20 BST during the procession of the hearse, and no departures between 15:03 BST and 16:45 for the ceremonial procession via the Long Walk to Windsor Castle.
Between 16:45 BST and 21:00 BST, departures will be reduced to support the committal service at St George's Chapel.
Flights will also be diverted around Windsor Castle ""to minimise noise during the private family service and interment"", it said.
In a statement, Heathrow apologised for the inconvenience but said that ""as a mark of respect, operations to and from the airport will be subject to appropriate changes in order to avoid noise disruption at certain locations at specific times on Monday"".
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has issued guidance which means that air passengers whose flights are cancelled or badly delayed on Monday because of Heathrow's changes will not legally be entitled to financial compensation. That is because these are likely to be deemed extraordinary circumstances.
However, airlines are offering customers refunds or re-bookings.
British Airways said its cancellations were on short-haul European flights where multiple services run on the same route, and that it was adding larger aircraft where possible to help customers re-book on operating flights.
Alternatively they can choose to have a refund. No long-haul BA flights will be affected but some will be re-timed.
What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral
Queen's funeral plans: What we know so far

Virgin Atlantic also apologised for the inconvenience. A spokesperson said passengers on the affected flights, between Los Angeles, San Francisco and Heathrow, would be rebooked on alternative same-day services wherever possible, or could rebook for later dates, take a voucher or request a refund.
It said the airport and airlines were working closely with the air navigation service provider NATS to minimise the impact of these restrictions on passengers.
A Heathrow spokesperson added that extra staff would be on hand in terminals to support passengers, and that people were encouraged to travel on public transport instead of by car, because roads around the airport would be extremely busy. 
Other changes at Heathrow during the period of national mourning include observing the National Moment of Reflection with a one-minute silence at 20:00 on Sunday, showing the Queen's funeral on screens at the airport on Monday, and closing non-essential shops.
Shops deemed ""essential"", such as WH Smith, Boots and Travelex, will remain open along with restaurants, cafes and pubs.
Separately, tens of thousands of passengers are set be affected by a French air traffic control strike on Friday.
Ryanair has cancelled 420 flights, most of which were scheduled to fly over France, affecting 80,000 passengers.
EasyJet is cancelling 76 flights, British Airways will cancel 22, while Air France said it would only run 45% of its short-haul flights.
SNCTA air traffic control union said the walkout was over wages, as inflation soars, and recruitment.
Ryanair said all passengers affected had been notified this morning. The low-cost carrier normally operates more than 3,000 flights per day.
Neal McMahon, Ryanair operations director, said it was ""inexplicable"" that thousands of European citizens and visitors ""will have their travel plans unfairly disrupted"".
""It is inexcusable that passengers who are not even flying to or from France are disrupted,"" he said.
He said French laws protect French domestic flights, but not ones flying over the country.
""It is time that the European Union step in and protect overflights so that European passengers are not repeatedly held to ransom by a tiny French air traffic control union,"" he said.
Ryanair called for other European air traffic controllers to be allowed to manage flights over France to ease the impact.
Budget rival EasyJet said it had cancelled flights at the request of French authorities.
EasyJet said: ""While this is outside of our control, we would like to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience they may experience.""
British Airways will cancel 22 flights - or 11 return - to and from Heathrow, including some which fly over France. It also said there could be some extra delays on the day.
Air France KLM said the French civil aviation authority - DGAC - had asked airlines to cut their Friday schedules from all French airports by 50%.
Air France said it would only run 45% of its short and medium-haul flights, and 90% of long-haul. It also warned delays and last minute cancellations could not be ruled out.
flight cuts affect the whole of France, the DGAC said, adding that it was currently working with the European air travel regulator Eurocontrol to help airlines avoid the country's air space.
Strikes across the aviation industry caused severe disruption to Europe's summer traffic, including ground and cabin personnel, who sought pay rises to cope with increased living costs amid high inflation.
In July, several strikes by firefighters and staff at Paris' Charles De Gaulle airport led to cancellations and delays."	/news/business-62916830

Developing Countries Trading Scheme comes into force in January and builds on a scheme the UK was first part of while a member of the European Union.
Goods such as clothes, shoes and foods not widely produced in the UK will benefit from lower or zero tariffs. 
me covers 65 developing countries. 
It is on top of the thousands of products which developing nations can already export to the UK without tariffs and will affect around 99% of goods imported from Africa.
Department for International Trade said the work was part of a wider push by the UK to use trade to ""drive prosperity and help eradicate poverty"", as well as reduce dependency on aid. 
me includes powers to suspend a country on the grounds of human rights or labour violations, as well as for not meeting their climate change obligations. 
International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: ""As an independent trading nation, we are taking back control of our trade policy and making decisions that back UK businesses, help with the cost of living, and support the economies of developing countries around the world.
""UK businesses can look forward to less red-tape and lower costs, incentivising firms to import goods from developing countries.""
Many goods, from textiles to fruit, in 65 of the world's poorest nations already benefit from reduced or zero tariffs when sold to the UK, making them more appealing. 
w scheme cuts some of those charges further - for example, on cucumbers which can not be produced here during the winter. 
It also simplifies the rules for which items, such as some textiles, qualify for preferential treatment. 
ges could save importers millions of pounds - although, even if passed on in full, the price savings for consumers may be marginal. 
Coming when aid to developing countries has been reduced, the scheme underlines a government policy of using trade instead. 
me removes some seasonal tariffs on products like cucumbers, which cannot be grown in the UK in the winter, so they are tariff-free during this period for the majority of countries under the scheme. 
It also simplifies trade rules such as rules of origin, which dictate what proportion of a product must be made in its country of origin. 
Mohammed Jabbar, managing director of DBL Group, a textile business from Bangladesh, said this was a ""game changer"" for his company. 
""[The changes] mean we will be able to source our cotton from many more countries than we could before, which will make the business more competitive and our supply chains a lot more resilient,"" he said. "	/news/business-62557128

Care Quality Commission (CQC) visited Plymouth's Derriford Hospital in September.
Problems highlighted by inspectors included a shortage of staff and major challenges with patient flow.
CQC said the pressures were ""mainly due to limited availability of social care beds and community care"".
Its head of hospital inspection, Catherine Campbell added this ""has impacted on the number of medically fit people able to be discharged"". 
She said: ""This has hindered flow throughout the hospital, causing people to experience long delays.""
Inspectors said the same issues were raised in October 2021, and the trust was ""struggling to meet the fundamental standards of care due to the significant and sustained pressures"".
Although the overall rating for the hospital is Requires Improvement, it was rated as Outstanding on the question of how caring its services were.
In urgent and emergency services, inspectors found people could not always access timely treatment and there was not always enough staff.
re were also problems with overcrowding in the department, and staff did not always feel valued or respected by the wider organisation.
In the medical wards, inspectors found there was not always enough nursing and support staff to keep people safe, problems with patient flow and low staff morale.
Ms Campbell said: ""The trust's senior leaders know what must be done to manage the issues. This includes closer working with local healthcare partners.
""In the meantime, the conditions will remain in place and we will continue to monitor the service closely.

entertainment	I'm A Celebrity: Matt Hancock told breaking Covid rules was 'slap in face'	"Matt Hancock has said there was ""no excuse"" for the actions that led to his resignation as health secretary.
f I'm A Celebrity also saw one campmate tell the MP his behaviour was ""a slap in the face"".
He resigned after he was caught on CCTV kissing a colleague while social distancing guidelines were in place.
Hancock, who was accused of failing to follow the rules he helped put in place, said: ""Look, I know how people felt. That's why I resigned, right?""
Hancock quit his cabinet position in June 2021 after the Sun obtained footage of him having an affair in his ministerial office with aide Gina Coladangelo, for whom he later left his wife.
On Thursday's episode, TV presenter Scarlette Douglas asked Hancock about the encounter, which breached coronavirus social distancing rules.
""It was hard. A lot of people had difficult times,"" she said. ""And then to see that people that had kind of set the rules had then broken them, I think was a big slap in the face for everyone.""
West Suffolk MP has faced criticism from his constituents and MPs from across the political spectrum after heading to the Australian jungle for ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! 
Hancock was suspended as a Tory MP after his involvement was announced. He has said he hopes to raise awareness for his dyslexia campaign while taking part in the series. 
Douglas warned Hancock it may take time for some campmates to come to terms with his arrival in camp.
She told him: ""There's a lot of things that happened with you during the times, which does make it difficult because people are angry and upset - emotions are running high.""
""We are not going to ever exclude anyone,"" she continued. ""We want to make sure that everyone's a family, but if it does feel tough for the first few days, I'm sure you understand why.""
Hancock replied: ""That's very good of you to say that.""
Later in the Bush Telegraph, Hancock told viewers: ""Scarlette was very open and also very thoughtful and that's really what it's all about.
""Being able to talk about things, whether they're things you're proud of, or things you're not proud of.""
During a separate conversation with comedian Babatúndé Aléshé, Hancock discussed how his life had changed after his affair became public.
""It was really tough,"" he said. ""I messed up and I fessed up. I resigned and it's no excuse but I fell in love, right? That also had a lot of other consequences obviously.""
Asked whether he was still with Ms Coladangelo, he replied: ""With Gina? Yeah very much so, yeah, totally. That'll be the best thing about being kicked out [of the series], seeing her on the bridge.""
Hancock has frequently apologised for his behaviour since stepping down as health secretary. Last year, he told the BBC he was ""sorry to those I have let down"".
Matt Hancock told the BBC last year he was sorry he let people down after breaking social distancing guidance

former health secretary was seen collecting 11 stars in Thursday's episode, the maximum number possible, winning meals for everyone in camp that night.
As he was lowered into the water to begin his trial, host Ant McPartlin asked him: ""You must have met a few snakes in your time in Westminster."" Hancock replied: ""I see what you did there.""
As Hancock made his way back to the camp after completing the trial, comedian Seann Walsh and soap star Sue Cleaver were seen discussing his decision to enter the jungle.
Asked what he thought when he met Hancock, Walsh said: ""I'm just going to say it how I saw it, he was really lovely, and that man will have a very different account of what he did to what we all think happened and there will be reasons.
""I'm not justifying anything that that guy did or certainly what that government, you know, the decisions they've made, but being in his job while that [the pandemic] was going on...""
Cleaver replied: ""I totally, totally agree with you, but the choice after everything that happened, and the impact on everybody at home and families and people in homes, to make a choice to come into I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! does not sit well with me.""
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC on Thursday that Hancock should ""voluntarily leave"" the I'm A Celebrity jungle and return to Parliament.
ursday's episode concluded with Ant and Dec revealing to campmates that Hancock and singer Boy George had been jointly voted to take part in the next Bushtucker trial."	/news/entertainment-arts-63591640
sports	Kathy Whitworth: Golfer who broke record for wins dies at 83	"Kathy Whitworth - the professional golfer with the most trophies - has died aged 83, America's Ladies Professional Golf Association has said.
""Her 88 LPGA victories are the most ever on a professional tour,"" it said.
xan took six more trophies than her rival Mary Kathryn ""Mickey"" Wright, as well as men's game joint record-holders Sam Snead and Tiger Woods.
She died suddenly on Saturday night while celebrating Christmas Eve with family and friends, her partner said.
""Kathy left this world the way she lived her life, loving, laughing and creating memories,"" said Bettye Odle without providing any further details.
Whitworth won six majors during her decades-long career, and came very close, being a runner-up in 1971, to winning the US Women's Open - the most prestigious trophy.
In 1981, she became the first woman to earn $1m (£829,000) on the LPGA tour.
""I would have swapped being the first to make a million for winning the Open, but it was a consolation which took some of the sting out of not winning,"" she said at the time.
Her last professional title was in 1985 - 23 years after she triumphed for the first time.
Paying tributes, LPGA commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan said Whitworth was ""one of the most incredible women"".
""Kathy was a champion in the truest sense of the word, both on the golf course and off,"" she said in a statement."	/news/world-us-canada-64092178
technology	Police text 70,000 victims in UK's biggest anti-fraud operation	"Detectives have begun contacting 70,000 people suspected of being victims of a sophisticated banking scam.
Metropolitan Police is sending text messages to mobile phone users it believes spoke with fraudsters pretending to be their bank.
Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley described an ""enormous endeavour"" in gathering evidence after the discovery of an online fraud network.
re have been more than 100 arrests so far, and one man has been charged.
People who receive a text message in the next 24 hours will be directed to the Action Fraud website to register their details as officers build cases against suspects.
Sir Mark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Met was contacting mobile numbers that were connected to the fraudsters for longer than a minute, suggesting a fraud or attempted fraud had taken place.
m involved fraudsters calling people at random, pretending to be a bank and warning of suspicious activity on their account.
would pose as employees of banks including Barclays, Santander, HSBC, Lloyds, Halifax, First Direct, NatWest, Nationwide and TSB.
fraudsters would then encourage people to disclose security information and, through technology, they may have accessed features such as one-time passcodes to clear accounts of funds.
As many as 200,000 people in the UK may have been victims of the scam, police said, with victims losing thousands of pounds, and in one case £3m.
70,000 people being contacted are connected to calls made by individuals known to police, Sir Mark said, and their evidence could be used to prosecute cases.
Genuine messages from police will be sent on Thursday or Friday, detectives said. They said the messages would direct victims to the Metropolitan Police website which would ask people to register with Action Fraud. Any other texts should be regarded as fraudulent themselves.
mammoth cyber fraud operation began when police in the Netherlands bugged a website that allowed fraudsters to make anonymous phone calls from spoof numbers, posing as bank employees.
Spoof website, which has since been taken down by the FBI, crucially allowed scammers to access one-time passcodes and passwords, detectives said. 
One-time codes, often delivered through text messages, have become a standard security measure for most online banks in recent years.
Det Supt Helen Rance, from the Met's Cyber Crime unit, said victims would not have known the phone call was coming from iSpoof.
""The person on the other end of the line can be very convincing,"" she said.
""This is an absolutely devastating crime for so many people. They must be worried, I really feel for them,"" she said.
Fraudsters paid between £150 and £5,000 a month in bitcoin to use the iSpoof service, contacting, at times, 20 people a minute, primarily in the USA, UK, Netherlands, Australia, France and Ireland.
So far, police believe £48m may have been stolen by criminals using iSpoof. This figure is likely to rise. Those behind the service are allegedly earning £3.2m and living ""lavish"" lifestyles.
A notice on the website says that it has been taken down by the FBI.
Det Supt Rance said the investigation remained active.
Police believe 59,000 potential suspects may have used the iSpoof service, but are prioritising those in the UK who have spent at least 100 Bitcoin to get access, believing they were anonymous.
Early in November they raided an address in east London and arrested a man alleged to be behind iSpoof.
In other raids, 120 people thought to have used the service for fraud have been taken into custody.
Det Supt Rance warned other criminal ""enablers"" will have taken over to provide services to fraudsters.
""Undoubtedly they will go to another website,"" she said. 
A 34-year-old man, Teejai Fletcher, has been charged with making or supplying articles for use in fraud and participating in the activities of an organised crime group.
He will appear at Southwark Crown Court on 6 December.
Call your bank directly, checking its website for the correct number to ring. If the fraud involved any of your personal information, consider signing up for a Protective Registration with fraud prevention organisation Cifas, which costs £25 for two years.

sports	Luka Doncic scores magical 60-point triple-double in Dallas Mavericks win	"Luka Doncic scored an outstanding 60-point 'triple-double' to help the Dallas Mavericks claim a 126-121 overtime win over the New York Knicks.
23-year-old Slovenian racked up 60 points, 21 rebounds and 10 assists, posting double figures in three key attacking metrics.
With the Mavericks down 115-113 in the final seconds, he deliberately missed a free throw, claimed a rebound, and scored a jumper to force overtime.   
""I'm tired, I need a beer,"" he said.
Doncic is only the second player to score a 60-point triple-double, and only the seventh to record a 50-point triple-double, in the NBA, and he becomes the youngest to achieve the feat, taking the record from all-time great Wilt Chamberlain.
His performance powered a superb comeback win for the hosts who trailed by 110-101 with fewer than 45 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.
Doncic's decision to intentionally throw his free-throw attempt against the backboard, claim the ball in the ensuing melee and have the composure and accuracy to drain his shot, was the highlight of his team's renaissance.
""I just threw it up, I was kind of lucky,"" he admitted. ""We were down, we came back, this is an amazing feeling.""
Doncic's stellar game attracted praise from across the league and from giants of the game's past.

sports	Beijing Olympics: What’s wrong with natural snow?	"Heavy snow has been falling on venues at the Beijing Olympics, yet the organisers are still pumping out artificial snow on to competition slopes, saying it's more suitable for the events. 
rganisers have insisted on using it to ""ensure the quality"" at the Games remains high.
Artificial snow was first used in winter sports in the 1980s. Vancouver 2010, Sochi 2014 and Pyeongchang 2018 all relied to some extent on artificial snow. 
Beijing has very limited winter snowfall, and the volume of artificial snow used at these Games has reached an unprecedented high of more than 90%. The Yanqing National Alpine Ski Centre has relied almost entirely on the artificial variety.
It is estimated that 49m gallons (222.8m litres) of water have been used to produce millions of cubic metres of snow.
Both are made of frozen water - but under the microscope the differences in their structure is clearly apparent.
Natural snow starts as crystals in cold clouds, forming elegant six-sided symmetrical snowflakes that grow as they fall to the ground.  
Machine-made snow is far more dense, trapping far less air within its structure.
With less air, and more ice, artificial snow is harder and wetter - and also icier, which makes it more suitable for some sports.
It's also easier to maintain a consistent quality throughout competitions, providing as similar conditions as possible for all participants.
Some new snow machines have an on-board computer system that can calculate the most suitable mix of water to produce snow with the same condition down a long ski slope.
""Artificial snow offers consistent and predictable slope conditions,"" according to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). 
""The controllable and adaptable nature of man-made snow makes it a better fit than the natural version for developing ski courses for elite racing."" 
Not all competitors prefer the hard stuff. 
Some skiers favour the dry, soft natural snow, as it provides a surface that skis can glide over easily. 
Fresh snow also provides skiers and snowboarders with an almost weightless feeling and is often favoured by athletes who are flying off jumps.
rder, faster artificial snow can also pose risks to athletes. 
British freestyle skier Laura Donaldson told BBC Sport artificial snow could be dangerous. 
""If freestyle super pipes are formed from snow-making machines in a poor season, the walls of the pipe are solid, vertical ice and the pipe floor is solid ice,"" she said. ""This is dangerous for athletes.""
rocess of producing artificial snow is both energy- and resource-intensive. 
was an issue that concerned the IOC when it was evaluating candidate cities to host the 2022 Winter Olympics.
It said Beijing's ""reliance on artificial snowmaking would require [the] diversion of water from existing reservoirs and may impact other land uses"".
Beijing insists the water used for the Olympics accounts for less than 2% of the local supply. It also says the snow cannons being used need 20% less energy than ones used in previous games."	/news/60406195
technology	Instagram fined €405m over children's data privacy	"Irish regulators have fined Instagram €405m for violating children's privacy. 
g-running complaint concerned children's data - particularly their phone numbers and email addresses.
Some reportedly upgraded to business accounts to access analytics tools such as profile visits, without realising this made more of their data public. 
Instagram's owner, Meta, said it planned to appeal against the decision. It is the third fine handed to the company by the regulator.
""We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of €405m [£349m],"" Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) said.
A Meta official told BBC News: ""This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private. 
""Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they know can see what they post and adults can't message teens who don't follow them. 
""While we've engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated and intend to appeal it. 
""We're continuing to carefully review the rest of the decision.""
DPC regulates large technology companies with European headquarters in the Republic of Ireland.
It has never given such a large fine for a breach of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.
But last year, it fined WhatsApp €225m, while Luxembourg's data authority fined Amazon a record €746m.
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) child-safety-online policy head Andy Burrows said of Instagram's fine: ""This was a major breach that had significant safeguarding implications and the potential to cause real harm to children using Instagram. 
""The ruling demonstrates how effective enforcement can protect children on social media and underlines how regulation is already making children safer online. 
""It's now over to the new prime minister to keep the promise to give children the strongest possible protections by delivering the Online Safety Bill in full and without delay."""	/news/technology-62800884
technology	Shinzo Abe killing: Hideo Kojima threatens to sue over false posts	"A legendary video game developer has threatened to sue over hoax posts portraying him as Shinzo Abe's killer.
Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima was linked to the shooting of Japan's former prime minister in pictures on website 4chan.
mages were shared by a French politician and reportedly broadcast by Greek and Iranian news outlets.
Kojima Productions said it ""strongly condemns the spread of fake news and rumours that convey false information"".
4chan post used a photo of Kojima and falsely labelled him as a ""left-wing extremist"" with a criminal record. 
It also included a picture of him wearing a type of Ushanka, or fur hat, worn by soldiers in communist Russia, and another of him standing next to a picture of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara.
Screenshots on social media showed Damien Rieu, a French politician associated with the country's nationalist movement, had tweeted out images of Kojima with text translated to: ""The far-left kills"".
He has since deleted his tweet and issued an apology to Kojima, saying he ""naively took a joke for information"" and ""was wrong not to check before sharing"".
In response, the game director's company tweeted a statement warning it would consider legal action over the spread of false information.
Mr Abe died last Friday after he was shot with a homemade gun.
Police say the suspect, named as Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, has admitted the killing.
By Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC Disinformation journalist
In the immediate aftermath of a tragedy, details are often murky and emotions run high.
In the absence of reliable information, misleading claims fill the gap, and Mr Abe's assassination wasn't an exception.
False claims that the assassination was staged, that Mr Abe wasn't bleeding in pictures, that the man arrested was not the real suspect, and that he was Korean or Chinese, were posted on Japanese social media.
But in other parts of the world, the focus was on Mr Kojima and a play on a racist trope about Asians.
Arguably the biggest hub of internet subculture, 4chan has been responsible for many false claims and memes. 
't the first time Mr Kojima has been the target of online misinformation. Posts falsely accusing him of ""aborting and mummifying a baby"" went viral just a few weeks ago in the context of abortion debate in the US.
As always, the best practice is to wait for reliable information from relevant authorities and trusted news sources, and avoid sharing unverified claims, no matter how viral they may be.
Japan's longest-serving prime minister, who served for a year in 2006 and then again from 2012 to 2020, before stepping down due to health reasons.
Abe later revealed that he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis, an intestinal disease.
While he was in office, he pushed more assertive policies on defence and foreign policy and wanted to amend Japan's pacifist post-war constitution.
On Japanese social media, the hashtag ""We want democracy, not violence"" was trending throughout Friday, with many users expressing their horror and disgust over Mr Abe's killing.

entertainment	Letter from Africa: The Afro-punk band taking on 'whitewashed' history	"In our series of letters from African journalists, Ismail Einashe meets some Kenyan musicians with a cult following who are challenging the status quo.
Crystal Axis, a five-piece Afro-punk band, has established itself as one of the leading group on Kenya's burgeoning rock music scene. 
I find them rehearsing in a recording studio at the International Trade Fair Grounds, on the outskirts of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
One of the guitarists plays distorted riffs on his instrument with a scratchy, heavy sound as the drummer energetically beats his drums. 
group is made up of Ahmed Bulhan, known as AB, on vocals, Djae Aroni and Fox Elijah on guitar, Doug Kihoro on bass and Dan Gichia on drums and percussion.
r origin lies in Nairobi's late noughties alternative music scene, which had a number of bands performing everything from indie rock and punk to heavy metal. 
At the time Aroni was at school when one night he snuck out of home to see a post-hardcore band, Jack the Hammer. The lead singer and guitarist happened to be Elijah. 
Seeing Elijah rocking it out on stage in his black skinny jeans, classic Vans and fierce punk attitude had an impact - and the next day Aroni went to school and told his friends he wanted to start his own rock band. 
Shortly afterwards in 2009 he set up Crystal Axis and was soon joined by AB, with Elijah and Kihoro joining in 2017 and Gichia last year.
Growing up as teenage rockers and performing while still in secondary school posed its problems, says Aroni.
ge bouncers at clubs who demanded to see their IDs: ""We literally had to bribe our way into our own gigs.""
Unlike most young Kenyans who are into Afrobeats or hip-hop, the raw energy of punk rock was their inspiration.
For Aroni it came from watching US group Green Day's live film Bullet in a Bible and seeing lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong holding his crotch while gyrating wildly on stage. He thought to himself then: ""This is what I want to do.""
His bandmate Kihoro was inspired by listening to Scandinavian death metal, while drummer Gichia honed his musical skills in his teens playing in a local Christian rock band. 
In 2017 the band released their first major EP, Leopold - a commentary on the mass colonial atrocities committed by King Leopold II of Belgium in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
Since then they have released three more EPs that have garnered them a devoted following in Kenya and internationally - people drawn to their bold, infectious and distinctly punk rock sound. 
r lyrics, in English and a smattering of Swahili, are highly political and delve into everything from colonial history and corruption to racism. 
""[We want to] tell African stories from an African perspective,"" Aroni says.
r hit single Nyayo House addresses the legacy of Daniel arap Moi, Kenya's longest-serving president, who led what became known as the ""Nyayo regime"". 
raging lyrics shine a light on a harrowing aspect of Kenyan oppression and are an indictment of an era when there was no freedom of expression in the East African nation.
Nyayo House is a high-rise government building in central Nairobi infamous for its torture chambers used for opponents of Moi, who was in power from 1978 to 2002. 
""We are dissidents… Nyayo is sickening,"" scream the lyrics of the song, which AB says is about ""generational trauma"" and the need for Kenyans to speak about this history. 
In August Crystal Axis released their latest EP, Black AF, a celebration of contemporary African identities.
It draws on their own experiences as young black Africans who contend with various challenges such as corruption, but is also a celebration of their strength, talent and creativity. 
wants to use the power of punk rock music to create a space for young Kenyans to make this music on their own terms.
Another aspiration is to reclaim punk rock history, which they say has been ""whitewashed"" and the contribution of black punk artists often forgotten. 
Aroni gives the example of black pioneers like Death, a proto punk band founded in Detroit in 1971, which tends not to be credited for its development of the early punk sound.
In the late 1970s punk heyday other black bands also played an important role in the explosive growth of the genre with groups such as Pure Hell, formed in Philadelphia in 1974, and X-Ray Spex, formed in London in 1976 by the Somali-British punk pioneer Poly Styrene.
As part of their efforts to challenge the image of punk rock music as a genre dominated by white, male bands, Crystal Axis was meant to play at the Decolonise Fest in the UK last month.
festival celebrates punk music by people of colour, but the band members were denied visas to enter the UK - much to their outrage and disappointment as they had sold out shows in Leeds, Manchester and London. 
But this has not dented their ambition - and they see punk rock as a powerful means to channel their rage, intellectual curiosity, joy and hopes.
In the recent Kenyan elections the majority of the band members did not vote, with Kihoro saying Kenyan politics is ""full of old men"".
Aroni agrees, adding that most young Kenyans feel powerless to alter the political landscape: ""We are disenfranchised. There's nothing we can do.""
Yet Crystal Axis' lyrics are a warning that young people should not be ignored.
r 2020 song Take The Throne about ""over policing"" in Kenya and the violence of the state explodes with words: ""Send your soldiers, send your mob. We're 50 million, and we're tenfold strong.
""Rip it down! We'll build again from scratch. Every roaring fire starts with just a single match.""

politics	COP27: Rishi Sunak urges world to move faster on renewable energy	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to urge world leaders at COP27 to move ""further and faster"" in transitioning to renewable energy. 
Mr Sunak will travel to Egypt on Sunday for the UN climate summit after U-turning on a decision not to go. 
In his address on Monday, he will say Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""reinforced"" the importance of ending dependence on fossil fuels. 
COP27 follows a year of climate-related disasters and record temperatures. 
rime minister will also tell leaders gathered in Sharm el-Sheikh not to ""backslide"" on commitments made at last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow intended to prevent global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.
But Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), has warned that the 1.5C target is ""barely within reach"". 
His comment comes as the UN's weather and climate body released a report showing that the rate at which sea levels are rising has doubled since 1993. 
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has described the report as a ""chronicle of climate chaos"" and urged governments at COP27 to answer the planet's ""distress signal"" with ""ambitious, credible climate action"".
Mr Sunak will meet French President Emmanuel Macron at the summit this week and the topic of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats will likely be raised. 
In a statement before his departure, Mr Sunak said: ""When the world came together in Glasgow last year, nations agreed an historic roadmap for preventing catastrophic global warming. It is more important than ever that we deliver on those pledges.
""Fighting climate change is not just a moral good - it is fundamental to our future prosperity and security.
""Russia's invasion of Ukraine and contemptible manipulation of energy prices has only reinforced the importance of ending our dependence on fossil fuels.
""We need to move further and faster to transition to renewable energy, and I will ensure the UK is at the forefront of this global movement as a clean energy superpower.""
It comes after the prime minister backtracked on attending the summit earlier this week. 
Mr Sunak had originally stated he would not travel to Egypt, arguing that his priority was to plug a £50bn hole in the public finances ahead of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's autumn statement on 17 November. 
Labour's Ed Miliband said the prime minister ""dithered"" about attending the climate summit, adding that: ""Britain needs to be in the climate leadership business.""
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the shadow climate change secretary said it was now ""cheaper to save the planet than to destroy it"". 
""We're in the midst of an energy crisis,"" he said, adding that renewable energy sources were now much cheaper than fossil fuels.
Mr Miliband insisted that switching to renewables was ""the opportunity of the future"" and that this was the ""message we should be taking to COP"".
Mr Sunak's initial decision not to attend the summit was widely criticised by climate campaigners, opposition parties and COP26 President and colleague Alok Sharma.   
Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden has defended the prime minister, saying he was ""committed"" to environmental issues. 
Mr Dowden told Laura Kuenssberg that, when Mr Sunak came to power, his first priority was the economic crisis but that he had worked on the Autumn Statement ""to make sure he can go to this summit"". 
Mr Dowden was also questioned about host country Egypt's human rights record, including its detention of British Egyptian national Alaa Abd El-Fattah, an activist who has been in jail for nine years and is on a hunger strike.
Asked if the prime minister would raise Abdel Fattah's case while at the summit, the cabinet minister said: ""I'm sure he will raise it at appropriate forums"". 
Labour's Mr Miliband said it was a ""very serous issue"" and that he would ""make sure to raise it with the Egyptians while I'm there"". 
rime minister has sent a letter to Abdel Fattah's family pledging that the activist's case is ""a priority for the British government both as a human rights defender and as a British national"". 
However, speaking on Sky News, Abdel Fattah's sister Sanaa Seif said she was concerned No 10's engagement with the Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi would come too late. 
Speaking of her worry that her brother could die while the climate summit was happening, she urged the British government to be ""responsible for getting us proof of life"". 
government has faced criticism for approving new oil and gas licences in the North Sea despite the International Energy Agency saying there can be no more new fossil fuel exploration if the 1.5C target is to be met.
Mr Sunak is expected to chair a meeting of world leaders to drive progress on the pledge signed by 100 countries at Glasgow to halt and reverse deforestation and damaging land use by 2030. 
r of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, said he did not think the climate summit this week would be a success. 
""I don't think there's been the leadership either from our country or frankly from other countries,"" he told Laura Kuenssberg.
Meanwhile the King, who made an address at COP26 last year and is known for his passionate interest in environmental issues, will not be attending the summit after Buckingham Palace agreed with former Prime Minister Liz Truss he would not attend. 
Although Downing Street suggested this week they may have come to a different view if Mr Sunak had been installed in No 10 earlier. 
round of UN climate talks takes place amid a backdrop of increasingly devastating extreme weather around the globe, and an energy and cost-of-living crisis driven by President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. 
COP27 agenda will highlight calls to reduce emissions, help countries deal with climate change, and secure technical support and funding for developing countries. 
UN has also warned that based on countries' latest climate action plans, there is currently no credible pathway to meet the 1.5C goal intended to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.
Rich countries are further falling short in providing finance to help developing nations adapt to climate change, according to the UN.

It follows a trial of a new app which heart patients are using through their mobile phones.
rial allows clinicians to change treatments quickly and uses video consultations, avoiding unnecessary hospital visits.
One 80-year-old patient using the app said it was ""brilliant"".
In March, Alun Morgan was told he had heart failure and doctors said stress could be a factor. 
He was placed on the trial to log his weight, blood pressure and the oxygen levels from the comfort of his home. 
""I now appreciate four months on just how many trips to hospital it's saved me,"" the grandfather of seven said.
""As far as I'm concerned I'm on a daily check up without having to move from the house, which is brilliant.

Rhodri Griffiths is the innovation adoption director at Life Sciences Hub Wales, and is looking for more ways to introduce similar technology.
He believes the pandemic accelerated the use and acceptance of digital solutions in healthcare, by patients and clinicians.
""We really are looking at a big digital revolution within healthcare and there are an amazing myriad of things coming through,"" he said.
He explained data collected by smartphones and watches can help predict who is likely to have a heart attack.
""We can avoid that happening. So prevention is key but it's also looking at how some of this can impact on waiting lists,"" he said. 
""So, looking at how theatres are used, which patients can be prioritised?
""In social care it's looking at how pain is managed by face recognition.
Mr Griffiths said he believed the data collected could also identify wider problems.
""It's combining these digital solutions with our genetic information - bringing big data together on a population level we can start spotting trends. 
""We can start understanding who may be at risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke in the future. 
""Services can be designed around it - there's huge prospects out there.""
However, he warned this would need a lot of investment.

In north Wales, 90% of the trial patients who received additional or ""escalated"" care, did so due to data collected by their devices.
Proactive care is believed to reduce the number of patients going to accident and emergency departments.
Latest figures show almost 10,300 people in Wales waited 12 hours or more in A&E in June, technology that cuts those numbers will be welcomed.
Mandie Welch, lead heart failure advanced nurse practitioner at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, said the technology had already ""facilitated the early discharge of patients from cardiac care units"".
She added it ""allowed us to quickly see the difference medications are making to heart rates and blood pressure"". 
She said: ""Crucially, patients told us that they feel better supported, and having the ability to track their own progress is helping to reassure them and better manage their conditions.
""We've already gone to a patient's home within a day to give them high dose water tablets to get rid of their fluid so they don't come to A&E, and the only reason we know that is because their weight has shot up on the app, and their heart rate has shot up, their symptoms are worse.
""Heart failure is known as the revolving door to A&E, so this app has identified those patients who are getting worse.
""Our main aim is to keep them living longer, to make them feel better and to reduce their readmission rate.""

business	Union calls for more Royal Mail strikes after new pay offer	"union representing Royal Mail workers is set to renew calls for strike action, calling the company's latest pay offer ""unacceptable"".
Royal Mail Group said it had put forward a deal, which included a pay rise worth 7% of a worker's salary over two years, and a 2% lump sum this year.
However, Royal Mail said the offer was subject to agreeing to changes with Sunday working and start times.
Union bosses accused the company of ""imposing change not negotiating"".
Communication Workers Union (CWU) said it would meet on Tuesday to call for strikes, after it previously called off planned walkouts on Sunday.
CWU has been locked in a long-running dispute with Royal Mail over pay increases keeping up with the soaring cost of living and working practices.
median pay at Royal Mail is £32,465 a year, with the average pay for a postal delivery worker lower than that at £25,777. 
Royal Mail has blamed strike action for rising losses and job cuts, as well as lower volumes of parcels being posted.
Its chief executive, Simon Thompson, said the company had reported losses of £219m in the first half of 2022, which demonstrated the ""need for change at Royal Mail is urgent"".
""We have always been clear that the more we can change the business, the more we will be able to pay our people - both now and in the future,"" he added.
Royal Mail has not provided specific details of the changes to working patterns, but said its pay offer was subject to the union agreeing to ""changes to Sunday working, start times and flexible working, so that Royal Mail can re-invent and compete in the growing parcels market"".
Mr Thompson urged union bosses to ""accept the change and pay offer without delay"".
ks between the union and the company have been held at the conciliation service Acas, and planned strikes in the next two weeks were called off following a legal challenge by the company.
union said on Monday the latest offer included ""more unacceptable changes"" and a ""derisory 7% two-year pay offer that is well below projected inflation for both years"".
""This reaffirms the company's whole approach of imposing change rather than negotiating it,"" the CWU added.
""Not only is the offer not applicable to Parcelforce and fleet employees, but the company have confirmed that, as of tomorrow, new entrants will be brought in on lower terms, and will be introducing owner-drivers into Royal Mail - a service that will be comparable to Uber."""	/news/business-63459389
business	Cost of living: Bath trader's sleepless nights over £100k energy bill	"A business owner is enduring sleepless nights after being told her energy bills will rise to over £100,000.
Annette Dolan, who runs Bath Aqua Glass, currently pays £14,000 a year, but is facing the steep rise at the end of September when her contract ends.
She said it would mean the price of a vase made at her glassblowing studio in Bath rising from £45 to £350.
Some businesses are already facing price rises in excess of 200% as gas and electricity prices soar.
Ms Dolan said she was concerned for the future of her business.
furnace at the Walcot Street business runs day and night, enabling staff to create handmade items including jewellery, jugs and stained glass.
But the increase has left Ms Dolan wondering how she is going to meet the costs.
""There's no way that we can actually operate at that level,"" she said.
""My bookkeeper and I are both having massive sleepless nights. We're both thinking, 'What are we going to do'?
""It's a nightmare. The brokers have been trying to get me to sign and I'm saying this is untenable, I cannot sign.""
Ms Dolan has worked in the glassblowing business for 26 years and says she will do all she can to keep the firm running.
""Whether I'm going to save this business or not only the future will tell me, but I will do my damndest for all my staff and myself,"" she added.
Energies, Ms Dolan's energy provider, said it offered a range of products to suit customer needs and advised customers to contact them if they are having difficulty paying.  
""We appreciate that unprecedented rises in wholesale gas and electricity markets and wider inflationary pressures are creating an extremely challenging operating environment for UK businesses,"" the company said in a statement.
Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said: ""No national government can control the global factors pushing up the price of energy, but we will continue to support business in navigating the months ahead.  
""This includes doubling our support for high energy usage businesses, reducing employer national insurance by increasing the Employment Allowance, slashing fuel duty, introducing a 50% business rates relief and putting the brakes on bill increases by freezing the business rates multiplier - worth £4.6 billion over the next five years.""

health	Ambulance Strikes: Paramedic says Covid can't be blamed for NHS pressures	"A paramedic who has joined thousands of ambulance workers on strike, has said ""Covid isn't to blame anymore"" for the pressures the NHS is facing.
Nicola Griffiths joined the picket line on Forge Lane, Stoke-on-Trent, because she wants better conditions for staff and patients as well as pay.
Unions want pay increases to keep up with the rising cost of living.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay said a further pay increase would take money from frontline services.
NHS England says emergency care will continue to be provided.
unions representing ambulance workers have not set a specific wage figure but argue any offer needs to be high enough to prevent a recruitment crisis.
Ms Griffiths said the NHS had ""completely broken down"".
""It is completely underfunded, nurses, porters, cleaners, everyone who works for the NHS doesn't get what they deserve,"" she added.
Wages are not going up to correspond with inflation, she said.
ramedic said that she had been on shift when some patients had to go into four different ambulances as they waited outside of the hospital.
""We are all finishing really really late because of shift change, we have to wait for another crew to pick us up and swap ambulances.""
On one of the worse days, delays in patient handovers saw 25 out of the county's 57 ambulances waiting outside Royal Stoke University Hospital.
Mr Barclay said most ambulance staff have received a pay rise of at least 4%, taking average earnings to £47,000. A further pay increase would mean taking money from frontline services, he added.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has insisted he will not back down against striking workers. He has said the best way to help the workforce would be to reduce inflation as quickly as possible.

health	Desperate NHS pays up to £2,500 for nursing shifts	"NHS bosses are increasingly paying premium rates for agency staff to plug holes in rotas, the BBC has found.
Spending in this area rose by 20% last year to hit £3bn in England.
For many shifts, bosses have been so short-staffed they have been willing to breach the government pay caps for these agency workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
Separate data supplied by Labour showed some NHS trusts had paid as much as £2,500 to fill shifts. 
Out of 60 responses from trusts, 10 reported the most expensive shift cost over £2,000, and for another 13 it was between £1,000-2,000.
BBC has also seen evidence of aggressive marketing by agencies - which take a cut of the shift pay. One boasted it is the ""best"" time to try it, because the fees that can be commanded are increasing.
Although paying out £2,500 for one nursing shift may not be the norm - it shows how much supply shortages can cost the NHS.
Saffron Cordery, interim chief executive of NHS Providers which represent trusts in England, said: ""Trust leaders consistently raise concerns about sky-high agency costs. 
""They're already facing enormous financial pressures with the impact of inflation and energy costs, and the government's failure to fully fund staff pay awards.
""They are doing all they can to minimise agency spend. But safety must always come first.""
government said the NHS faced some exceptional pressures last year, but it expected spending on agency staff to fall in the future.
BBC spoke to one cancer doctor who was offered work for £130 an hour - well above the cap for his role - and described the fees available as ""astonishing"" and a reflection of ""desperation by management"".
Dr James Barson qualified four years ago. But instead of taking the traditional junior doctor route, he now solely focuses on agency work in hospitals across Lincolnshire.
reason? Pay and the flexibility. He can earn more than twice what he would get paid if he was on the NHS payroll, without the need to commit to nights and weekends.
""Being a junior doctor is very difficult, very demanding. Being a locum I can work nine to five, Monday to Friday and take days off that are entirely my decision."" 
He says he would not consider taking a shift for less than the market rate of £50 to £60 an hour.
But he says there are downsides to agency work, including lack of holiday and sickness pay, as well as ""not always feeling a welcome part of the team"".
Agency pay rates are capped at 55% above what a normal employee would receive. 
But the BBC investigation found for nearly nine in 10 agency shifts for doctors and dentists, and four in 10 for nurses the caps were exceeded last year.
NHS bosses can only do this if there is a significant risk to patient safety.
rise in 2021-22 comes after the NHS had appeared to get on top of the use of agency work following a government crackdown in 2015-16 when the cap was introduced.
Ministers set the NHS the task of moving away from agency work, encouraging the use of NHS staff banks, where employees do overtime.
After six years, during which spending had been curbed, the £500m jump has caused concern.
BBC used a combination of Freedom of Information requests to individual NHS services, as well as analysing published data, to find out what was going on with agency spending, as well as using data obtained by Labour.
About six in 10 trusts provided information on their own levels of spending. It showed huge variation, with some services spending less than 1% of their staff budget on agency workers and others in excess of 11%.
Previously reported figures suggest spending also appears to be rising in other parts of the UK. In Scotland it has doubled in the past year, while in Wales it has risen by more than 40%. 
In Northern Ireland, it is four times higher than it was three years ago.
Colchester Hospital is just one of many services which is increasingly relying on agency workers.
Emergency department matron Andy Seale says it is a constant battle making sure there are enough staff available.
""Sometimes you can spend a couple of hours every day trying to sort rotas out.""
It is a picture that is repeated across the hospital and the other sites that are part of the East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Trust. 
Chief executive Nick Hulme says a combination of factors is playing a role, including the need to open extra wards to cope with rising demand, as well as staffing shortages. 
Some people are even leaving their jobs, only to return later as agency workers. 
He says while many agency workers do fantastic work on the wards, he would still prefer to be able to use his own staff. ""We know that's best for patient care, best for patient experience. Agency staff require more supervision and tasks such as handovers take longer."" 
He acknowledges it is not the best use of taxpayer money, but says he has no choice. ""Quality and safety of care is always going to be the priority,"" he adds.
Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at the King's Fund think tank, said the NHS was caught in a ""vicious cycle"". 
He said a combination of staffing shortages, Covid sickness absences and rising demands was driving the increase in reliance on agency workers.
""I don't think what is happening is a surprise. There will always be some reliance on temporary staff, but you want to minimise it.""
And Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting called it an ""infuriating"" use of money.
""Taxpayers are picking up the bill for the Conservatives' failure to train enough doctors and nurses.""
He said Labour would train the doctors and nurses the NHS needs by abolishing the non-dom tax status, where UK residents whose permanent home is elsewhere may not have to pay UK tax on foreign income.
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the past year had seen some exceptional workforce pressures, and a drive to get services back to normal following the pandemic.
But she said the expectation was that spending would be reduced by at least 10% this year.
""We have a clear policy to reduce agency spend through capping the hourly pay of agency and temporary staff, ensuring they are only hired through approved NHS agreements to ensure value for money, and prioritising NHS staff.""
She said the government was in the process of developing a workforce plan that would help ensure the health service had the staff it needed in the future.
Currently one in 10 NHS posts is vacant.

health	East of England Ambulance Service declares critical incident	"East of England Ambulance Service (EEAS) has declared a critical incident following ""huge pressure"" from 999 calls and hospital handover delays.
NHS service said: ""We can ensure our resources are focused on patients with the greatest need, as well as allow us to access wider support from our health and care partners.""
It said staff were working ""incredibly hard in challenging circumstances"".
Other health services said they were also ""experiencing major pressures"".
mbulance service, which covers Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, said it was responding to calls and incidents as quickly as possible.
""If you need to contact us because of a life-threatening condition or serious injury, then call 999,"" the service added.
""For everything else, we would urge you to please use 111 online, speak to your GP or use a minor injuries centre.""
It said a critical incident allowed the service to manage extreme demand, and added that in October it was on the verge of declaring a ""major incident"". 
""It makes certain actions possible, including asking NHS colleagues to make releasing EEAS crews a priority, prioritising the sickest patients and those unable to make their own way to hospital, and cancelling some staff meetings, training and assessment,"" it said.
Comments on social media said one family had been waiting six hours for an ambulance for a their 92-year-old grandmother, and another had waited 11 hours for an ambulance that never came on Saturday night for their son. 
Hertfordshire and West Essex NHS Integrated Care Board (HWEICB) said the situation was so serious that ""health bosses and the most senior doctors and nurses"" had united to appeal to the public.
It said A&E departments at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Lister Hospital in Stevenage and Watford General, along with community health services and GP practices, were all stretched by the number of people calling for help.
Dr Jane Halpin, chief executive of the ICB, said: ""Our services are under extreme pressure, which is why it's vital that everyone understands the urgency of the situation and what they can do to ensure that we protect essential health services for when we really need them.
""If you come to A&E in Hertfordshire with a minor condition or illness, your care will not be a priority and you will face an extremely long wait.
""You may be sent away to visit a GP or pharmacist. If you call 999 for an ambulance and you don't need one, you could endanger the life of another person in desperate need of emergency care.""

business	UK inflation could hit 18% next year on rising energy bills, experts warn	"Rising energy prices could push UK inflation as high as 18% next year, the highest rate in nearly 50 years, economic analysts have predicted.
Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 10.1% in July, five times the Bank of England's (BoE) target.
Investment bank Citi said inflation was ""entering the stratosphere"" and could rise to 18%, while the Resolution Foundation said it could reach 18.3%.
BoE predicted inflation will rise to more than 13% in the coming months.
Citi's forecast - which would be the UK's highest rate of inflation since 1976 - comes ahead of Friday's energy price cap announcement on the maximum amount suppliers can charge households for gas and electricity from October.
ment bank's forecast is at the higher end of the scale compared to those made by other economists, such as EY-Parthenon which has forecast inflation to be at 15.4%.
However, economists at the Resolution Foundation think tank told the BBC that based on the current price cap predictions and the latest data on the rate prices are rising at, inflation could go as high as 18.3%. 
Citi's chief UK economist, Benjamin Nabarro, said affordability concerns were ""growing more deafening by the day"".
""The question now is what policy may do to offset the impact on both inflation and the real economy,"" he said.
Consultancy Cornwall Insight now expects a typical household energy bill to £3,554 a year from October. This is slightly below its previous forecast.
However, it now expects energy regulator Ofgem to announce a price cap in January of £4,650, which is higher than its previous estimate of £4,266. 
Its calculations reflected a 15% increase in wholesale prices in the last week, Cornwall said.
But the ""highly volatile nature of the market"" means these figures are expected to go up and down over the next couple of months, it added.
From October, all UK households will see their energy bill reduced by £400 through monthly instalments over six months, with a reduction of £66 in October and November, and of £67 a month from December to March 2023.
Eight million low-income households have already begun to get support for the rising cost of living, with the first instalment of payments totalling £650 hitting bank accounts in July.
But Citi said, without further government support, the price cap could hit £3,717 in October and £4,567 in January, reaching £5,816 in April.
Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, buying a pint would cost £25.
""People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around £5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,"" he said.
Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there were 10 food groups that have seen their prices rise more than 18.6% in the past year, including bread, milk, pasta and butter.
""Inflation at 18.6% would push millions of people into dire straits,"" she said.
""And because these horrible price hikes are being driven by the essentials people need to stay alive - like food and heat - it's going to hit those on lower incomes hardest, who've got nothing left to give.""
Bank of England has been raising interest rates since December and earlier this month implemented its largest increase - 0.5% - in 27 years to take borrowing costs to 1.75%.
But Citi said it expects the Bank to increase interest rates even higher, to as much as 7%, to control inflation.
On Monday European gas prices rose sharply due to supply fears, after Russian energy firm Gazprom announced it would shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline - the main gas export route to Germany - to complete three days of unplanned maintenance.
British gas for immediate delivery was also up 37% to 503p per therm. 
Oil and gas analysts at Investec said, in a briefing note, that it anticipated UK gas prices to remain elevated if Russia continues to restrict supplies to Europe. 
""This is remarkable in summer, when gas demand for heating is at its lowest,"" its analysts said.
""The outlook for UK/European gas prices are to remain high - even in 2025 it is three-times the 10-year average.""
Predicting the peak of inflation levels has been a mug's game in the last nine months. 
Bank of England originally predicted last year it would peak at 5%, then 10, then 13. HSBC recently revised its forecasts to 14% and on Monday global investment bank Citi set a new high watermark of 18%. 
Almost all of this inflation of inflation estimates has been caused by rocketing gas prices, which find their way into almost everything we buy. 
What is clear is that the forces that have propelled prices higher look like they are going to get worse before they get better.

entertainment	Jet Black: 'Inspirational' drummer for the Stranglers dies aged 84	"Jet Black, the original drummer for 1970s and 80s punks The Stranglers, has died aged 84, the band has confirmed.
musician, who was born Brian Duffy, was a founding member of the Guildford group, playing on hits like Golden Brown, Peaches and No More Heroes.
He last performed with them in 2015, announcing his retirement a few years later due to ill health.
In a statement online, his ex-bandmates described him as an ""elder statesman"" of British music.
Bassist and co-frontman JJ Burnel said: ""After years of ill health, Jet has finally been released. He was a force of nature. An inspiration. 
""The Stranglers would not have been if it wasn't for him. The most erudite of men. A rebel with many causes.""
Sil Willcox, the band's manager, added: ""Jet Black was the real deal. Astute in business, a talented drummer and an obsessive perfectionist. 
""I will cherish the times we planned, pranked, ate, drank and laughed on so many great nights together.""
Stranglers, formed in Surrey in 1974, went on to became an integral part of the riotous UK punk and new wave scenes.
Despite the indolent, youthful rage associated with the genre, Black - a semi-professional drummer in the late 1950s and early 1960s - was, in fact, by then a successful businessman in his mid-30s.
He owned a fleet of ice cream vans and later an off-licence called The Jackpot and a home brewery. In the early days, the Stranglers used one of the vans as a tour bus and his shop as their headquarters.
Speaking to the band's official website in a 2010 interview, Black said he never doubted the decision to shift his focus away from business and back into music.
""Once I had made the decision, and then the commitment, I then pretty much burnt my bridges, there was no turning back,"" he said. ""I told myself that one way or another I was going to succeed. 
""Now, there were many, many problems, but my thoughts were focussed on how to solve them, not on questioning whether I had made the right decision.""
Black, who always rejected the term ""punk"" to describe his band, later told BBC Breakfast: ""We were on a mission to break all the rules and create something new and exciting; and that's what we've been doing for the past 40 years.
""We've developed a style of music that is very aggressive and exciting.""
Drummer Jet Black: ""We on a mission to break all the rules""
Supporting US punk stars the Ramones and Patti Smith at their UK gigs, The Stranglers' musical virtuosity set them apart from the more DIY aesthetic of their peers.
After original frontman Hugh Cornwell left in 1990, the band continued touring and recording. According to Cornwell's autobiography, when he phoned Black to announce his resignation, the drummer's response was simply ""OK, fine"".
On Thursday, Cornwell paid tribute to Black, noting how they had ""shared a special period"" of their lives together, achieving their dreams of becoming musicians.
""We were immediately drawn to one another, he had a singular sense of purpose that I identified with,"" wrote Cornwell. ""He threw everything in his previous life out, to dedicate himself to our common goal.""
Adding: ""The Stranglers success was founded on his determination and drive... His timing was faultless.""
In 2007, the band announced that Black was suffering with heart issues and he took a step back from performing, being temporarily replaced by his drum technician.
He resumed his duties full-time for the band's tours in 2010 and 2011, but the following year he was taken to hospital after falling ill just before he was due on stage in Oxford.
musician, who had suffered respiratory issues since childhood, began to restrict his live work to the UK, although he vowed to ""carry on until I'm incapable of doing it"".
Despite difficulties in performing towards the end of his career, he remained a fan favourite. Audiences would often chant his name as he took his place behind the kit, until he finally retired in 2015.
Black wrote several books chronicling his time in the band - most notably The Stranglers' infamous 1980 arrest in Nice, France, where they had allegedly incited a riot (they also famously clashed with members of the Clash, Sex Pistols and Ramones, as well as journalists).
An enthusiastic furniture designer, he also patented the Jet Black Power Bass Drum Pedal.
When asked how he would like be remembered by the band's website in 2010, Black replied: ""I guess if we are actually remembered, then that will do.""
In a statement, his representative confirmed the musician had passed away ""peacefully"" on Tuesday 6 December at his country home in Wales.
He leaves behind his wife Ava, and his two children Charlotte and Anthony. 
Black's death comes two years after The Stranglers' keyboard player Dave Greenfield died at the age of 71 after testing positive for coronavirus.
Greenfield, originally from Brighton, had contracted the virus following a prolonged stay in hospital for heart problems."	/news/entertainment-arts-63904248

After Liz Truss's ""shock and awe"" blitz of policy announcements rapidly became the awe and shock for her of them imploding, the new PM and cabinet are seeking to make a virtue of stepping rather tentatively, rather gingerly. 
But that means, right now at least, we know very little in concrete, specific terms about what the government wants to do, let alone will do. 
Anything with the merest hint of economics, or budgets (ie almost everything) is stonewalled with a plea to wait for the Autumn Statement. 
fortnight away. 
re is political and economic logic to this: there are big and difficult decisions to make beforehand, and they take time. 
But in the meantime, lots of non-answers. 
As for those summer promises, the prime minister's press secretary told us the government was ""considering all of them"" and asking ""what is deliverable and what is possible"". 
""We are committed to the sentiment of them,"" she added. 
Inevitably, we reporters asked what is the point of making a promise if it isn't deliverable? 
In response, we were told they were promises made ""a few months ago"" and that ""the context, especially economically, had changed significantly since that time."" 
We can't do what we wanted to do because of Liz Truss, they seemed to mean, even if they didn't say. 
And yes, the economic circumstances have changed and Mr Sunak is desperate to be seen to be measured, cautious, patient, and thinking.
Everything her critics said Liz Truss was not. 
So what of the 2019 Conservative election manifesto, so often referred to by the prime minister?
It is, after all, that document that underpinned the policy prospectus of the winning Tory campaign at the last general election.
rime minister is committed to the ""promise of the manifesto"".
Which is not quite the same thing as the individual promises within it. 
Again, the government can point to how much the world has changed in the last three years - not least the pandemic. 
And for the next week or two they'll continue to lean on variations of ""we don't know yet"". 
But that line will only last so long."	/news/uk-politics-63486668
business	Juul: US bans all products from leading vaping company	"US is banning the sale of all products sold by Juul, one of the country's top e-cigarette companies.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it did not have enough data to be sure that marketing the firm's products was ""appropriate for the protection of public health"".
Juul said it would challenge the move.
It comes after other recent anti-smoking efforts by the FDA, including plans to reduce the amount of addictive nicotine allowed in cigarettes. 
gency had already barred the fruity flavours that helped make Juul a phenomenon among teenagers a few years ago.
""Today's action is further progress on the FDA's commitment to ensuring that all e-cigarette and electronic nicotine delivery system products currently being marketed to consumers meet our public health standards,"" FDA commissioner Robert M. Califf said in a statement.
Juul, founded in California in 2015 by a pair of former smokers, has promoted its vaping pods as a healthier alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes.
But the products, which contain high concentrations of nicotine, raised alarm as use among teens exploded, with more than quarter of high schoolers using e-cigarettes in 2019, according to a federal survey.
In 2020 the FDA said it would require companies to submit their e-cigarette products for approval. It has since granted some of them a green light.
In its statement, the FDA said it had not received any information to suggest an ""immediate hazard"".
But it also noted the major role Juul, whose products under review had nicotine levels of 3% and 5%, still plays in the market.
""We recognise these make up a significant part of the available products and many have played a disproportionate role in the rise in youth vaping,"" Mr Califf said.
Juul said it would seek a stay of the ruling, which would allow it to keep selling as it explores options including an appeal.
""We respectfully disagree with the FDA's findings and decision and continue to believe we have provided sufficient information and data based on high-quality research to address all issues raised by the agency,"" the firm's chief regulatory officer, Joe Murillo, said in a statement.
""We intend to seek a stay and are exploring all of our options under the FDA's regulations and the law, including appealing the decision and engaging with our regulator.
""We remain committed to doing all in our power to continue serving the millions of American adult smokers who have successfully used our products to transition away from combustible cigarettes, which remain available on market shelves nationwide,"" he added.
Juul has already seen its business hit by regulatory action, as officials investigated its marketing practices to teens and tightened rules on what flavours could be sold. International restrictions have also limited its expansion outside the US.
Altria Group, which took a 35% stake in the company in 2018 for more than $12bn, has been forced to write off much of the value of its investment.

entertainment	PnB Rock: Father and son pair charged with rapper's murder	"A father and son have been charged with the murder of rapper PnB Rock. 
musician, 30, was shot dead at a Los Angeles waffle house on 12 September.
Authorities say Freddie Lee Trone, 40, and his 17-year-old son were each charged with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree robbery and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery.
Mr Trone's wife Shauntel has also been arrested and charged with one count of being an accessory after the fact.
PnB, real name Rakim Hasheem Allen, rose to fame with the release of his 2016 hit Selfish and had collaborated with artists including Ed Sheeran.
He was having lunch with his girlfriend on the day of the shooting when a gunman approached the pair at Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles in south LA.
Police said the suspect demanded they hand over valuables shortly before he opened fire, removed items from the victim then fled in a waiting getaway car.
PnB suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead in hospital 45 minutes later.
ger, who name was not published in the charge announcement, made his initial appearance in a juvenile court and is scheduled to return on 19 October for a pre-trial hearing.
Los Angeles's top prosecutor, District Attorney George Gascón said PnB's killing had ""dimmed a bright light in the lives of his fans, friends and most importantly his family. 
""The accused individuals' alleged actions in this case were heartless and cruel and robbed the world of Mr Allen's talents.""
ributes flooded in for PnB after his death, from artists including Drake, who posted a photo of the two together on his Instagram story.
Rapper Offset posted a Twitter tribute urging followers to pray for PnB's two children, with Nicki Minaj calling him ""a pleasure to work with"".
PnB Rock was born in Philadelphia in 1991, going on to record two studio albums, Catch These Vibes and Trapstar Turnt PopStar.
He released his final song, Luv Me Again, just two days before the shooting.

politics	Labour promise biggest ever transfer of powers	"Watch: The Labour leader says the first five years of a Labour government would see the House of Lords abolished
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has promised ""the biggest ever transfer of power from Westminster to the British people"" if elected.
Labour published a report on Monday by former prime minister Gordon Brown setting out plans for sweeping constitutional change, including abolishing the House of Lords.
would release £200m a year and change the economy, Sir Keir said.
He called the reforms an end to short-term ""sticking plaster politics"".
Sir Keir told BBC Breakfast the unelected second chamber was ""indefensible"", and added that a Labour government would abolish it and replace it with an elected body ""with a strong mission"" - but did not provide an exact timeframe.
""I'm very keen that all of the recommendations in the report are carried out as quickly as possible,"" he said, adding the proposals could be implemented within five years of a Labour administration.
report, entitled A New Britain, put forward 40 recommendations, including proposals for handing new economic powers to English mayors, local authorities and devolved governments.
Sir Keir said he commissioned the report ""because I profoundly think that the fact we hold too much power in Whitehall is holding us back, not only politically - with people feeling more distant form politics - but economically"". 
""Amongst the reasons we have failed to grow our economy in the last 12 years is we're not allowing every part of the UK to play its part economically,"" he told the BBC. 
Keir Starmer is making a big pledge: a massive transfer of power away from London to the rest of the UK.
Is it the biggest priority facing the country? Not everyone will think so. But Labour is adamant it is a way of making sure better decisions are made that work for local people in different parts of the UK.
Gordon Brown has been working on this report for two years. It's a chunky read and there is a lot in there.
At the moment though, Labour isn't endorsing everything. It's a direction of travel, Sir Keir says, but he wants to now go away and discuss the detail and a timetable.
Will it actually happen? Scrapping the Lords has been on Labour's agenda for quite some time. Some are sceptical it is the best use of time for a new Labour Govt, if there is one. 
But the hope in the Labour party is this starts a process that will end in a rewiring of the UK's political system.  
report argues the ""continuing over-concentration of power in Westminster and Whitehall is undermining our ability to deliver growth and prosperity for the whole country"", creating a ""vicious circle"".
One of its most eye-catching recommendations is the proposal to scrap the Lords, but other recommendations include:
government is ""doing a great deal to devolve power to local areas"" and has relocated ""thousands of jobs"", the prime minister's official spokesperson said.
Responding to Labours plans to restrict second jobs for MPs, the prime minister's spokesman said ""outside interests and experience outside Westminster can bring benefits"".
ze and role of the Lords has come under scrutiny in recent years, amid warnings that unelected membership has grown excessive, with about 800 sitting members.
Observer reported last month that Sir Keir told Labour peers part of the argument for reform was the public having ""lost faith in the ability of politicians and politics to bring about change"".
However, Labour peer Lord Mandelson warned that, without agreement from other parties, Labour's plans risked dragging the party into a ""quagmire of disagreement"".
""It's going to soak up acres of time and energy, which, frankly, a Labour government would be better devoting to other priorities and other needs in the country,"" he told BBC Newsnight.
""Don't imagine that you're going to be able to pull it off simply by the Labour Party agreeing with itself and imposing some outcome on everyone else.""
Director of the Institute for Government, Dr Hannah White, said the plans were ""certainly ambitious"". 
""It would require the House of Lords to agree to itself being abolished or at least significantly reformed,"" she said.
""We have had multiple efforts in the past to reform the House of Lords in the past which have fallen foul of the politics, which have failed to achieve consensus.""
Speaking to Times Radio, Conservative peer Lord Norton argued the Lords should remain unelected and urged caution over ""Big Bang reform"".
He said the ""detailed legislative scrutiny"" done by the Lords ""improves the law of this country"".
Former Cabinet minister, Tory MP Simon Clarke criticised the move, saying: ""Anyone who has looked at the institutionalised gridlock in US politics can see the utter stupidity it would be to create an elected upper house.""
But Labour sources insist the party remains committed to abolishing the Lords.
rty will consult on the report's proposals and the timeframe in which they can be delivered before deciding whether to put them in its next election manifesto.
One Labour source said ""everything in our manifesto we will seek to deliver in a parliamentary term"".
report comes as Labour enjoys a handsome lead in the polls over the Conservatives, who lost a by-election in Chester by a large margin this week."	/news/uk-politics-63851922
technology	Ofcom urged to help end broadband loyalty penalty	"ms regulator Ofcom has been urged to do more to help broadband and mobile customers who pay a ""loyalty penalty"" for staying with their provider.
Some long-standing customers pay more than new customers for the same service and Citizens Advice wants action taken.
In 2021, Ofcom estimated switching could save people £83 a year on mobile bills and £61 on broadband. 
A Citizens Advice survey of 3,087 UK people suggested up to one-in-seven may be paying a ""loyalty penalty"".
Citizens Advice told BBC News the survey suggested one-in-three broadband customers and one-in-10 mobile customers with bundled contracts - who pay for their handset and airtime together - could be affected.
Stopping the penalty, it argues, will make a big difference to hard-pressed households.
Ofcom said that since it had introduced new rules requiring providers to send prompts to shop around, the number of out-of-contract broadband customers has fallen by more than one million. 
It also said overpayment among mobile customers with bundled contracts had dropped by £100m, after operators committed to cut prices when initial contracts end.
regulator also requires companies to give details of their best annual deals to customers who stay with them without taking a new contract.
Citizens Advice analysed 165,000 budgets of people who came to it for debt help.
Its findings suggested that those with the lowest incomes spent almost double the proportion of their income on telecoms, when compared to the highest earners.
rity cited the example of Tracey, who it said is reliant on disability benefits.
According to Citizens Advice, she signed up to a £30-a-month package which included TV, landline, broadband and international calls in 2006.
In January, she started going through her bills looking for potential savings, and found its cost had risen to £80.
""Everything is going up; gas, electric, food and I have a mortgage to pay. I shop late in the evenings to get yellow-sticker discounted food, I turned off my gas as I can't afford to repair the boiler or use the heating, and I don't go anywhere other than my hospital appointments,"" she told Citizens Advice. 
""New customers pay £50 less than me for the same deal. I have paid nearly £3,000 more for being a loyal customer. How on earth can they justify me paying so much more - especially as I was with them for 16 years?""
Mike Emmett, who runs training for advisers at Citizens Advice Cardiff & Vale, said: ""Many people see their mobile and broadband as a lifeline. They need them to speak to people and do things like manage their universal credit account, and help children with their homework."" 
He said many were reluctant to switch out of fear of ""rocking the boat, particularly because of the prospect of credit checks"". 
""It's so frustrating when we see people who are on the lowest incomes paying the loyalty penalty, as they're forced to jump through so many hoops to try and sort it."" 
In January the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) effectively ended gradual year-on-year increases, so-called ""price walking"", for car and home insurance by requiring companies to automatically switch their customers to better deals. 
Citizens Advice is looking for similar action from other regulators.
Ofcom said its focus was on making sure customers can get the best deal. 
It said switching to a new deal when an existing one ends can result in significant savings and that it had taken action to make the process simpler and quicker - a  ""One Touch Switch"" system is also due to be introduced in April 2023.
Ofcom added: ""There is also a moral imperative on providers to support out-of-contract customers suffering financial hardship, and it is vital they do all they can to help them secure a deal that is more affordable."" 
In February, Ofcom found that 4.2 million households could halve broadband bills by taking up social tariffs, low-cost deals offered by broadband firms to people on low incomes, but only 55,000 homes had in fact done so.
Ofcom wants firms to promote these deals more widely.
Internet Service Providers Association - a UK trade body representing many broadband firms - said industry efforts had led to ""more customers than ever"" switching.
It said its members were determined to help customers through the cost of living crisis and urged those struggling with bills to contact their provider."	/news/technology-62347172
sports	Commonwealth Games: Daniel Powell and Lachlan Moorhed win judo golds for England	"England's Daniel Powell and Lachlan Moorhead took Commonwealth gold as the host nation claimed five judo medals on Tuesday.
Walsall's Powell delighted a raucous crowd at Coventry Arena with a nail-biting men's -73kg golden score win over The Gambia's Faye Njie.
""To have the crowd, I didn't want to disappoint them,"" said Powell. ""They were the reason I won.""
Moorhead defeated Canadian Francois Gauthier Drapeau in the men's -81kg.
He dedicated his gold medal to his father, who was celebrating his birthday.
""My dad was my first coach. I'm sending out a birthday message to him,"" Moorhead said. ""He hates birthdays and presents, but he can't be mad at me today.""
Gemma Howell took silver as Katie-Jemima Yeats-Brown and Kelly Petersen-Pollard won bronze.
""My career has been a rollercoaster; I thought I'd quit in 2016 and I don't know how I managed to keep going, but I did,"" said Howell, 32.
""I couldn't be more grateful to those who kept me going as this year I've ticked off three of my career goals.""
Wales' Jasmine Hacker-Jones also clinched bronze in the women's -63kg, beating Cameroon's Audrey Jeanette Etoua Biock by ippon.
re was disappointment for Northern Ireland trio Eoin Fleming, Rachael Hawkes and Joshua Green as they all lost their bronze medal matches.
European champion Howell initially enjoyed the better of her final against Canada's Catherine Beauchemin-Pinard, but she could not find a way to end the contest with her opponent forcing a brilliant golden score win.
It was a second Commonwealth bronze for Yeats-Brown, eight years on from her first in Glasgow, as she defeated Northern Ireland's Hawkes by ippon in the women's -70g.
Peterson-Pollard claimed the other bronze in that category with a win by ippon over Joy Oluchi Asonye of Nigeria."	/sport/commonwealth-games/62399126
health	East of England Ambulance Service: Inside a 999 control room	"Faced with answering thousands of calls a day, often concerning life-or-death emergencies, what is it like to work in an ambulance control room?
""We've now got over 100 calls outstanding, waiting to be responded to,"" says Thomas Pont.
It is Wednesday and the 30-year-old is on shift as duty manager at the East of England Ambulance Service's control room in Hellesdon, near Norwich.
rust has three control rooms, with others in Chelmsford and Bedford.
Hellesdon base dispatches to Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Waveney, in Suffolk.
few days, he says, have been particularly difficult, with delays getting patients into hospital.
""We're not able to respond to patients so we then start stacking up, stacking up and stacking up,"" he says.
Calls are categorised from one - for the most serious and anything immediately life-threatening - to four, which are non life-threatening emergencies requiring transport to hospital.
Mr Pont says they should respond to category two calls within 40 minutes but they are taking 90 minutes - and they are telling those in the less serious categories an ambulance may take 15 hours.
If a doctor calls for a patient who needs to go to hospital, but it is not urgent or time critical, they will be advised it will take 22 hours, he says.
He adds they also advise people that, if they can, they are better getting themselves to hospital.
""That's the reality of the situation we're in at the moment,"" says Mr Pont.
""This is making the best of a bad situation.... It's about us being really open and transparent with people and saying, 'Look, we are struggling'.""
""It gets frustrating looking at jobs and you can't do anything,"" says dispatcher Chantelle Cornwall.
43-year-old's job is to get the most appropriate resource to patients by juggling the priority levels of calls. She is in charge of dispatching 49 crews. 
""You need to be able to multitask. Sometimes, on a crazy day, my head can feel like it's spinning. I have to be able to monitor everything,"" she says.
Ms Cornwall says delays at hospitals can be ""so frustrating"" if it means crews are stuck there.
""It can be difficult, no-one likes to have calls uncovered. It's stressful when you can't cover your own call or everyone is busy dealing with incidents or is stuck at hospital,"" she adds.
""If you haven't dispatched on all your patients by the time you leave, you feel like your job isn't complete.""
ry to reduce the number of calls waiting, the ambulance service is introducing a scheme to use more advanced paramedics or advanced practitioners to get ""the right help to the right people"".
Richard Davis is one of the advanced paramedics on hand.
""It's all about trying to get the right care to the right patient as swiftly as possible,"" he says.
Mr Davis, who has worked in the ambulance service for 20 years, describes the workload as ""stressful"". 
""I walk in that door and I sprint until I try to go home,"" he says.
He is full of praise for his colleagues.
""It's fundamentally an amazing team and I'm not sure they get the appreciation they rightly deserve for what they do, put up with, go through and come back tomorrow and do it all again, day in, day out,"" he says.
mbulance service is improving its call response times after a recruitment drive, says Rob Hazell.
30-year-old, who is in charge of recruitment, says the number of call handlers has increased by 136% within 12 months, something which, he says, has improved the average call pick-up time.
He says in July, the average call pick-up time was one minute and 18 seconds. In November, it was 21 seconds.
Calls waiting for more than two minutes per day were 804 in July. In November, it was 121, he adds.
""The increase in head count has helped massively,"" he says.
""I certainly feel that recruitment and retention has arguably had the biggest impact on what we have been able to serve our patients in terms of calls pick-up and calls waiting.""
But, he says, the trust still has a challenge with retaining staff. 
At the start of the year, he says they lost on average four call handlers every week. That average is now just below two, he says.
Helping staff feel part of a team and a well-being culture has improved retention, says Mr Hazell.
Melissa Rowlands, 39, joined the ambulance service in March 2020 as a call handler, two months after being made redundant from her previous role. 
Now a senior call handler, she says the death of someone she knew ""changed her perspective"" and made her ""realise how you really want to take care of people"".
""It all made sense,"" she says. 
She says there are calls that ""stay with you"".
""I can talk to my partner if I need to but, at work, the green family as we call it, we understand what each other are going through,"" she says.
""I love my job. It can take a toll but we are trying the best we can.""
With Christmas parties, the World Cup and the current cold snap, Ms Rowlands has a message for people heading out. 
""Take a coat out with you, be sensible, have a plan about how to get home,"" she says. ""We are not there to be a taxi service.""

entertainment	Edinburgh Fringe: The viral comedy stars leaping from TikTok to the stage	"A number of new comedians amassed huge followings on TikTok during the pandemic. Now some are trying to convert viral fame into on-stage success by performing live at the Edinburgh Fringe.
kTok has emerged as a major force in comedy, by letting anyone share short, funny videos. The company is even sponsoring Edinburgh's annual comedy festival and hosting a virtual stage this year.
While social media isn't likely to replace stand-up, it has allowed a new generation of budding comedy stars to bypass the traditional routes to make their names.
But can the online sensations cut it in front of a live audience? Here, four of the biggest TikTok comedy acts who are performing at Edinburgh this month talk about becoming viral stars, taking to the stage - and whether the two can exist together.
In the olden days (ie a few years ago), a comedian at Edinburgh would hope to be spotted by an agent or TV producer who might one day be able to help them build a global fanbase. In the age of TikTok, performers like Christian Brighty can do it themselves in a few months.
""I'm going to tour America next year - which is an obscene, ridiculous idea,"" says Brighty, 28, from Cambridgeshire. ""I'm an alternative comic who, in 2019, was doing shows in dingy pub basements where I think Covid began. And I now have enough people to go and take my show to America. That's insane.""
Just under half of his 430,000 TikTok followers are in the US, and it's easy to imagine his riotous and knowing parodies of lusty period dramas going down well in the post-Bridgerton era. He joined the platform while furloughed during lockdown, posting a video a day for a month.
""It was a safe enclosed space to be creative, to experiment, to fail,"" he says. ""There are no repercussions for posting a bad video because no-one will see it. But if you post a good one, then millions of people might see it. I learned so much in that time.""
His first video to break the million mark was inspired by watching Poldark with his girlfriend's family. He has gone on to establish regular, silly characters - a romantic poet, a highwayman with a hobbyhorse, and a running story that sends up the allure of the archetypal aloof hero.
Forcing himself to make lots of TikToks honed his joke writing and quality control, he says. ""And it's made me become a better live performer, without a doubt.""
His Edinburgh show Playboy, co-written with Amy Greaves, centres on another alter-ego, Lord Christian Brighty, a cross between Mr Darcy from Pride and Prejudice and Blackadder's Lord Flashheart.
""You can't just take what you do on TikTok and put it in front of an audience live. It won't work,"" he says. 
""I describe them as siblings because they require different sensibilities. There's stuff in the [live] show that's far too slow for TikTok, because on TikTok you need a joke immediately, it needs a strong visual, and the idea needs to be at the header. Whereas you can't really do that on stage.""
ge show is more fully-formed and is ""the more authentic version of me"", he says. It was praised by The Telegraph, which said: ""An amusing 10-second video doesn't always translate to a good hour in the theatre, but in this case it indisputably has.""
Abi Clarke was ""very new"" to stand-up after spending a year doing low-key shows on the circuit before the pandemic hit. By the time the lockdowns finally ended, she emerged with hundreds of thousands of online fans. She now has 840,000 followers on TikTok and 360,000 on Instagram.
""Before, I was able to be anonymous and if a gig went bad, I'd just disappear and think, no-one's going to remember anyway,"" she says. ""Whereas now, there's more pressure there. Quite often people in the audience do know who you are or have come specifically for you.""
Some have even turned up wearing her merch. But on stage, Clarke is still taking things slowly.
She's not doing the standard solo hour-long show at Edinburgh, instead being one of four new comics on the bill at the Pleasance venue's prestigious Comedy Reserve night. ""I'm still in training,"" she says.
""If you see someone with a large social media following, a lot of people think you're the same as the comedians they see on telly. They're like, 'Well, you're a famous comedian'. But no, any comedian you see on TV has probably been going at least six years. And I've been going since 2019, with a two-year pandemic in the middle with no live performing.""
She found success online with shrewdly-observed, shareable sketches like If Cats Were Human and If Dogs Were Human, and skits about office gossips Jill and Tracey, and life inside Asos HQ. With their quick edits, multiple characters and maximum running times of a minute, they are very different from her stand-up routine.
""They really don't bleed into each other a lot to be honest. I'd say only twice I've written [live] material and written a sketch about the same thing.""
Her live routine is also ""a lot ruder"", she says. ""You get to be a bit naughtier on stage, whereas I think on the internet things can get taken out of context or people who speak different languages don't understand you're joking. So I think you've got to be very wholesome online. You've got to be your chirpy self.
""But on stage I get to show all sides of me, which is really fun because you work to get them [the audience] to like you at the start and then you can see how far you can go without losing them.""
When Irish comedian Lee Brophy started posting parodies as a lip-syncing, LGBT-accepting Catholic priest who ""puts the bi in Bible"", he attracted more than 700,000 followers on TikTok - and reactions ranging from death threats to cries for help from queer teens in strict religious families.
Brophy's Edinburgh stand-up show, titled False Prophet, is about the double-edged impact of becoming known as the TikTok priest - and he will effectively kill off the character at the end of the festival.
""It's been a weird journey,"" says Brophy, who was also on the stand-up circuit before the pandemic. ""I wasn't prepared for any of this. I was just making silly jokes on the internet and trying to get a little bit of feedback from people. And I got a lot of feedback from people.""
His broad-minded, fun-loving priest was originally in a TV pilot that Brophy wrote at the start of lockdown. The comedian decided to test the script by posting clips on TikTok.
""The priest was a very minor character to begin with,"" he explains. ""Then I put him up online and he had this progressive point of view that people resonated with, and I was like, oh, there's an appetite for this.
""So I thought, I'll just do that. It became a scenario of me waking up every single morning, putting on what was to me a costume, and sitting in front of my phone by nine o'clock lip-synching to Taylor Swift.""
Some didn't get the joke, though. ""There are the people who believe I'm a priest and love it. And then there are the people who absolutely detest it, who are like, 'You are leading people to hell'.""
His task now, he says, is to ""not necessarily erase that part because I'm grateful for all the things that have come out of it - but to [show] I am not that person, give myself the freedom to be a performer again, and to be recognised as a performer and comedian and an artist"".
In a five-star review, Edinburgh Guide said it was ""so clear that this is just the stepping stone into something so much greater"".
So, after his Edinburgh run, he will post a video putting Father Lee out to pasture. ""I've been playing along with this because it's been funny to me, but I kind of want my life back now,"" he says.
Before the pandemic, sisters Chloe and Tabby Tingey had given up on being performers. Chloe, who trained at Berklee College of Music in Boston, was working in digital marketing. Tabby, who went to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, had retrained to teach yoga.
Covid hit, the yoga studio never opened, and the pair moved in together. They dipped their toes into TikTok with weightlifting challenges, strangely. Then, having both been recently dumped, they decided to post a comic song about relationships.
""We thought no-one would see it because nobody followed us at that point,"" says Tabby, 28. They were wrong, and tens of thousands did see it.

health	Marion Biotech: Uzbekistan links child deaths to India cough syrup	"Uzbekistan's health ministry has said that 18 children have died after drinking a cough syrup manufactured by Indian drug maker Marion Biotech.
ministry said that preliminary tests showed a batch of the medicine contained ethylene glycol, a toxic substance.
ren were given the Dok-1 Max syrup without a doctor's prescription, it said.
mount they consumed also exceeded the standard dose for children.
gation from Uzbekistan comes weeks after The Gambia also linked child deaths to cough syrups made by another Indian firm. 
India's health ministry said in a statement that its officials have been ""in regular contact with the national drug regulator of Uzbekistan regarding the matter"" since 27 December.
It added that health officials have conducted an inspection of Marion Biotech's facility in Noida in Uttar Pradesh state.
""The samples of the cough syrup have been taken from the manufacturing premises and sent to Regional Drugs Testing Laboratory, Chandigarh for testing,"" the statement added.
Marion Biotech has not responded to the BBC's request for comment yet.
News agency ANI has quoted a Marion Biotech executive as saying that the company has halted production of the syrup temporarily. He added that the government was conducting an enquiry and that the firm would take action accordingly.
Marion Biotech is based in Noida, near India's national capital Delhi. Its website is currently down, but the company's LinkedIn page says it was founded in 1999 and that its products are ""household names in Central Asian countries, Central and Latin America, South East Asia and Africa"".
India produces a third of the world's medicines, mostly in the form of generic drugs.
untry, home to some of the fastest-growing pharmaceutical companies, is known as the ""world's pharmacy"" and meets much of the medical needs of developing countries.
Uzbek ministry statement, dated 27 December, says that Dok-1 Max tablets and syrup have been sold in the country since 2012. 
""It was found that the deceased children, before admission to hospital treatment, took this drug at home for 2-7 days, 3-4 times a day, 2.5-5ml, which exceeds the standard dose of the drug for children,"" the ministry said.
ment did not specify over what time period the deaths occurred. BBC Monitoring had reported on 23 December, citing news website Gazeta.uz, that Uzbek authorities were investigating ""claims that 15 children died in central Samarkand region over the past two months after taking a cough syrup made in India"".
On 26 December, Podrobno.uz news website reported that 21 children - 15 of them under the age of three - were treated for acute kidney failure ""allegedly caused by the India-made cough syrup Dok-1 Max between September and December"". Three of the patients recovered.
ministry also said that ""preliminary laboratory studies have shown that this series of Dok-1 Max syrup contains ethylene glycol"".
In October, the World Health Organization (WHO) had sounded a global alert and linked four India-made cough syrups to the deaths of 66 children from kidney injuries in The Gambia. It said tests on samples of the syrup showed that they contained unacceptable amounts of toxic substances diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol.
Both the Indian government and the company, Maiden Pharmaceuticals, have denied the allegations.
India said earlier in December that tests on the four syrups showed that they complied with specifications, and a government official told the BBC that the WHO had been ""presumptuous"" in blaming the syrups. But the WHO said it stood by the action taken.
Last week, a parliamentary committee in The Gambia recommended prosecution of Maiden Pharmaceuticals after weeks of investigation. The committee also recommended banning all products by the firm in the country.
As with the tragic reports from Uzbekistan, deaths of children in The Gambia were linked to Indian-made cough mixtures laced with high quantities of ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol - both toxic substances with the former found in, among other things, anti-freeze. 
Indian laws do require that all manufacturers adhere to strict quality control and production practices.
Experts we spoke to said that regulations suggest drugs meant for export are subject to same standards as those meant for local consumption, but it is unclear exactly how those standards are enforced. 
Public-health activist Dinesh Thakur points out the lack of proper accountability for producing sub-standard medicine. Currently, a fine of $242 (£220) and a possible prison sentence of up to two years is the punishment.
""Unless one can causally establish a direct link between a sub-standard drug and a fatality, this is the norm of punishment meted out,"" he told the BBC.
Countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia have banned Indian-made manufacturers due to substandard medicines in the past. The US Food and Drugs Administration has also banned some Indian-made medicines due to quality control issues. "	/news/world-asia-india-64114240

Radio broadcasts in 10 languages including Arabic, Persian, Chinese and Bengali will cease, the BBC said.
Although no language services will close, many will move online, to ""increase impact with audiences"".
BBC is also making wider annual savings of £500m, with CBBC and BBC Four also scheduled to move online.
In January former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries announced the licence fee would be frozen at £159 for two years. 
, combined with high inflation and soaring costs ""have led to tough choices,"" the corporation said. 
It added that the plans for the World Service support its strategy to create a ""modern, digital-led and streamlined organisation"".
r radio services that will end are Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Hindi, Indonesian, Tamil, and Urdu.
guages that will become online-only are Chinese, Gujarati, Igbo, Indonesian, Pidgin, Urdu, and Yoruba. 
World Service is an international multimedia broadcaster, delivering a wide range of language and regional services on radio, TV, and digital. It currently reaches 364 million people a week - about half of whom access it online. 
No language services will close, and the World Service will still ""serve audiences during moments of jeopardy"", ensuring that people in countries including Russia, Ukraine and Afghanistan will still be able to access the BBC's news services.
World Service English will also continue to provide around-the-clock news, available globally, and the corporation said it would announce new scheduling, programmes and podcasts at a later date.
Liliane Landor, the World Service's director, said: ""The role of the BBC has never been more crucial worldwide. The BBC is trusted by hundreds of millions of people for fair and impartial news, especially in countries where this is in short supply. 
""We help people in times of crisis. We will continue to bring the best journalism to audiences in English and more than 40 languages, as well as increasing the impact and influence of our journalism by making our stories go further.""
She added that there was a ""compelling case"" to expand digital services. 
World Service English will also invest in a new podcast for younger audiences globally, along with an hour-long science strand from the BBC's new science unit in Cardiff, plus more live news and sports programming.

sports	World Series 2022: Philadelphia Phillies beat Houston Astros 6-5 as game one goes to extra innings	"The Philadelphia Phillies overcame an early 5-0 deficit to beat the Houston Astros 6-5 in game one of the best-of-seven World Series.
Kyle Tucker smashed two home runs to put hosts Houston in control after three innings at Minute Maid Park.
But Philadelphia rallied in the fourth to make it 5-3 and JT Realmuto's two-RBI double tied it at 5-5 in the fifth.
Extra innings were needed but catcher Realmuto hit a home run in the 10th and the Phillies clung on for a nervy win.
Game two of the best-of-seven World Series takes place on Saturday evening at the same venue.
It was all going Houston's way when Tucker twice lifted Phillies starting pitcher Aaron Nola over the right-field fence, with a solo home run in the second inning and a three-run shot in the third for a 5-0 lead.
At that stage, Astros starter Justin Verlander had not allowed a hit, but the Phillies' bats woke up in the fourth as Nick Castellanos and Alec Bohm drove in runs to reduce the deficit to two before Realmuto levelled.
Indeed, the Astros were glad to still be level at the seventh-inning stretch after Castellanos struck out with the bases loaded.
In the bottom of the ninth, Houston's Jose Altuve stole second base but was left stranded when Castellanos' superb diving catch took the game to extra innings.
Realmuto, who was also hit in the face mask by a foul tip while catching, led off the 10th with a home run to right field off reliever Luis Garcia, but there was more drama in the bottom of the inning.
Alex Bregman smacked a double into the scoreboard in left field, Yuli Gurriel walked, and both runners advanced on a wild pitch.
With the Astros down to their last out, pinch-hitter Aledmys Diaz was struck by a pitch which would have loaded the bases had not the umpire ruled that he leaned into it - and Diaz then grounded out as the Phillies triumphed."	/sport/baseball/63435674

business	House price growth at 10% a year despite squeeze on finances	"UK house prices rose by 10% in the year to August, the Nationwide has said, despite pressure on buyers' budgets.
market still has greater demand from buyers than homes for sale, leading to a double-digit annual rise for the 10th consecutive month.
mortgage lender said the typical property price had risen by £50,000 in the past two years to £273,751.
However, the Nationwide said there were signs the market was cooling, as both energy costs and mortgage rates rise. 
ual growth in house prices did slow slightly last month, down from 11% in July, but the market remains tough for first-time buyers.
""Fast-rising rents are not offering any relief and could keep some buyers in the hunt for a home for longer than they would like,"" said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor,
""Even though the housing market is slowing, it is nowhere near a crash. Strong demand for homes far outstripping available housing inventory means the housing market remains a difficult one for wannabe homeowners and those looking to climb up the property ladder.""
Nationwide is predicting that an increase in energy costs and rising mortgage interest rates will add to the pressure on household budgets in the coming months.
It suggested that the least energy efficient property could typically see bills surge by £2,700 a year, or £225 a month.
""There are signs that the housing market is losing some momentum,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist.
""We expect the market to slow further as pressure on household budgets intensifies in the coming quarters, with inflation set remain in double digits into next year. 
""Moreover, the Bank of England is widely expected to continue raising interest rates, which will also exert a cooling impact on the market if this feeds through to mortgage rates, which have already increased noticeably in recent months."""	/news/business-62751244

At a meeting attended by Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, the British PM said the UK would ""back Ukraine for as long as it takes"".
Mr Sunak criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin for not turning up to the summit held in Indonesia.
""Maybe if he had, we could get on with sorting things out,"" he added.
Mr Sunak is attending the summit for the first time as UK prime minister, after replacing former Conservative leader Liz Truss last month.
war in Ukraine is set to dominate the conference of major world economies, taking place in the Indonesian island of Bali this week.
Speaking at a closed-door session for world leaders, Mr Sunak blamed the conflict in Ukraine for worsening economic conditions globally. 
He said Russia's ""weaponisation"" of energy and food exports was harming the world's poorest.
He added that ""countries should not invade their neighbours"", accusing Russia of undermining ""fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity"". 
""It is notable that Putin didn't feel able to join us here. Maybe if he had, we could get on with sorting things out,"" he added.
""The single biggest difference that anyone could make is for Russia to get out of Ukraine and end this barbaric war.""
Mr Lavrov is representing Russia - a G20 member - at the summit after Moscow said President Putin would not be attending. 
In a video speech earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged leaders to extend a UN-backed grain export deal due to expire on Saturday.
greement, struck in July, saw Moscow agree to allow ships to export millions of tonnes of grain and other foodstuffs from Ukraine through a safe corridor in the Black Sea.
Russia said on Saturday that there had yet to be any agreement to extend the deal.
In return for allowing Ukraine to ship out food, it has insisted the West lifts sanctions on a state-run agricultural bank, which it argues has effectively blocked Russian food and fertiliser exports.
Meanwhile, Mr Sunak has said China poses a ""systemic challenge"" to the UK.
His predecessor Ms Truss was reportedly planning to designate the country a ""threat"" to the UK as part of a foreign policy review. 
Asked whether he would do the same, Mr Sunak told reporters: ""I think that China unequivocally poses a systemic threat - well, a systemic challenge - to our values and our interests and is undoubtedly the biggest state-based threat to our economic security.
""But I also think that China is an indisputable fact of the global economy and we're not going to be able to resolve shared global challenges like climate change, or public health, or indeed actually dealing with Russia and Ukraine, without having a dialogue with them."""	/news/uk-politics-63633651
sports	Sophie Robinson: Ex-Wales hockey star reflects on career	"Former Wales hockey international Sophie Robinson said the sport ""has shaped her hugely"" as she reflected on her rollercoaster career.
Robinson, 34, retired from international duty after making 54 appearances - her last coming in the Commonwealth Games this summer. 
forward spoke out about mental health struggles and the financial barriers facing elite hockey players. 
""It was very emotional, but I left for the right reasons,"" she told the BBC.
""Any athlete will tell you the preparation for a major tournament is a lot on the body and the mind. Physically I thought my body was ready for a rest.
""My coach said I looked great, but in myself I was just tired. I would have loved to do [the European] qualifiers, but I've definitely done the right thing. I will miss the girls a lot though.""
Robinson ended her international career on a high after fulfilling a lifelong ambition of competing in a major tournament.
Beeston star missed out on the Commonwealth Games in 2010 as she was not eligible to represent Wales through her grandparents' birth. 
After that an eight-year absence from the international scene followed, impacted by the growing financial costs of representing Wales.
""For some players it can be quite challenging,"" said Robinson. 
""You look at the year ahead and you have to count not only what Wales hockey need off you financially, but also food, petrol and potential accommodation costs. 
""It was part of the reason why I left. It's so disappointing to still be in a situation where you are having to fund an international career. It makes no sense whatsoever.""
Robinson had stick sponsors who helped provide equipment and kit, but they could not support her financially. 
A close friend and former coach helped fund Robinson's career, but had to withdraw during the Covid-19 pandemic.
""It's disappointing I had to take eight years out of my international career. I could have hit 100 caps at the Commonwealth Games maybe if it wasn't for that. 
""The girls do struggle mentally with the financial difficulties, definitely.""
Robinson's international career was ""special"" but was a big commitment as players worked or studied full-time outside of hockey and travelled long distances for tournaments and training camps.
""We have to do other things to support this country to do well in sport and to keep inspiring the younger generation. It is always a privilege and an honour to put the Wales shirt on though,"" she said.
Preparing for the Commonwealth Games was demanding as Robinson developed anxiety during Covid.
Supposedly basic tasks like sitting in on team meetings or eating during set meal times were a struggle for Robinson.
""It spoilt some of my experiences after that,"" she said.
""It got to the point where I said 'I don't think I can play, I don't think I can put myself through this.' I still struggle now and then, but it's got better because I spoke up about it.
""The Commonwealth Games was very overwhelming. There were so many people, cultures and changes. I was more nervous about the opening ceremony than I was playing the games. It was strange.""
Robinson is grateful for the support she received from staff and team-mates during the Games but knew the time was right to end her international career afterwards.
""I didn't want to overdo it and get into bad habits where I wasn't eating enough sometimes due to my anxiety. 
""I've been back training with my club again and it's great. Beeston is home to me and always has been. I love it. When I finish playing for them too it will be really overwhelming! 
""Hockey has been a huge part of my life. It's like I don't know anything else. It has shaped me hugely. If I didn't have the hockey family I think I'd really struggle to cope. 
""My family and friends are amazing, but having that extra help is sometimes what you need.""

sports	Friendship Games 1984: When Great Britain took part in the 'Iron Curtain Olympics'	"Jayne Mitchell turned the key and pushed open the door.
""There was a small single bed, a weird thing in the bathroom that seemed like a mix of shower and bath, and this dodgy wallpaper, grease patches all over it, that looked about 100 years old,"" she remembers.
ree weeks before, on 28 July 1984, a man on a jet pack had flown into the Los Angeles Coliseum to open the city's Olympics. But in a divided era, Mitchell was on the other side.
Instead of Los Angeles, she was in Prague. Instead of the athletes village, she was in a low-rise hotel. And instead of the Olympics, she was at the Friendship Games. 
were an alternative Games for a different world view. After the United States and a clutch of its allies had stayed away from the Moscow Olympics in 1980, the Soviet Union and its allies retaliated with their own boycott four years later.
Pravda, the Soviet state newspaper, said the Friendship Games, organised by the USSR and its satellite states, would show ""that Socialist society provides more favourable facilities for the human beings' all-round physical and spiritual development"".
Sergey Bubka, the fresh-faced 20-year-old Soviet pole vault world holder, went further.
''It is a pity that the Olympic flame in Los Angeles was darkened by the spirit of profit-making,"" he was quoted as saying by the Soviet Union's official press agency. 
""The atmosphere of anti-Soviet and anti-socialist hysteria in the USA prevented athletes from most Socialist countries from participating in the Olympic Games. 
""We hope that 'friendship' competitions will show to the world at large anew the strength of athletes from socialist countries and their loyalty to the Olympic ideals.""
Mitchell, then aged 21 and competing under her maiden name of Andrews, had little knowledge of what she and the four-strong British team of female athletes were getting into.
And, more pressingly, as she stood surveying her sparse hotel room, she had no luggage.
Friendship Games had its own opening ceremony. One with fewer jet packs and more political messages.
In Moscow's Lenin Stadium, about 100,000 spectators, including future leader Mikhail Gorbachev in the VIP seats, watched troupes of dancers go through precisely choreographed routines.
Banners were unfurled exhorting the 'health of the people' and the place of sport in the Communist government's latest five-year plan.
Finally, there was a song. Specially composed for the event, it included the lyrics: ""To a sunny peace, yes, yes, yes, to a nuclear war, no, no, no.""
As Mitchell and her team-mates had gathered together on the tarmac at Heathrow, they'd thought they were heading to a regular continental meet.
Joyce Hepher was a long jumper. She had gained the distance to qualify for Los Angeles - but only two days after the British team had already been submitted to the International Olympic Committee. There was no way of adding her. So, instead she was boarding a plane to Prague, where the women's athletics events for the Friendship Games would be held. 
In all, nine countries served as hosts. The table tennis was in North Korea, the boxing in Cuba. 
""I only heard about it a week before we are about to travel,"" Hepher, then competing under her maiden name of Oladapo, tells BBC Sport.
""I had no idea about the magnitude of it all. I initially thought it was a Grand Prix type meeting and it was only when we arrived at the hotel and saw all of the other athletes. Literally anyone who was anyone in the Eastern Bloc was there.""
In the lobby were East Germany's Marlies Gohr and the Soviet Union's Lyudmila Kondratyeva, the world and Olympic 100m champions respectively. East Germany's Marita Koch, whose 1985 400m world record still stands today, was there. As was Czech Jarmila Kratochvilova, whose 800m mark from 1983 also remains unsurpassed.
Hepher looked down her own startlist in the long jump. Nineteen-year-old world champion Heike Drechsler was joined by Russian Galina Chistyakova, another whose world record from the era still endures.
""The qualifying round was quite intense,"" Hepher says. ""I remember waking up really early to warm up and when we got to the stadium, they had all this high-tech equipment on the runway that measured your speed coming to the board.
""I certainly hadn't come across that in any other competition.""
final was won by Drechsler with a leap of 7.15m. The top four at the Friendship Games all produced jumps greater than the one that had won gold in Los Angeles earlier in the summer.
""It was definitely a stronger competition than in the Olympics,"" Hepher adds. ""The first three got well over seven metres; it was a very competitive and very strong field.""
Mitchell's 100m event was similarly stacked. Gohr took gold in a faster time than American Evelyn Ashford had run for the Olympic title. Alice Brown, who won silver behind Ashford in Los Angeles, finished down in fifth, as the sole US track competitor.
But times and distances from the era came with questions. In the years since, the Iron Curtain has rolled back to reveal the work of state-sponsored doping regimes, even if many of its results still stand.
""Those rumours were always there,"" remembers Hepher. ""Things about Eastern Bloc athletes and their programmes and 'vitamins'. But until anyone was caught, no-one could really say whether they were drug takers or not.""
Mitchell adds: ""It was hard times for them as well. It wasn't really their fault; they were plucked from society as talented athletes and offered a better life for them and their families. It would be hard not to follow the regime in those countries.""
rformances, in-stadium technology and out-of-competition pharmaceuticals might have been world-leading. But life away from the track, on the street, was not.
After her luggage failed to follow her from Heathrow to Prague, Mitchell went to find supplies.
""I went to a series of local shops and in each there was a glass counter with one of everything on display - a toothbrush, toiletries, some clothes,"" she says. ""You would point to what you would want. 
""The underpants came in a pack of seven, with different days of the week written on them.
""There was a lot of poverty. We were given some canned drinks at some point and kids were clamouring around us because they wanted this can of Coke. It was really special to them to have something that, to us, was so ordinary.""
Eventually Mitchell's luggage - complete with the cans of beans and portable stove that she'd packed - arrived just in time for her return to London.
When they landed, there was no reception or ovation. In fact, there was little recognition of the Friendship Games at all.
re had been no coverage on television. There were no reports in the newspapers. With no British athletes taking part in the men's athletics events, Mitchell believes she and her team-mates were on the wrong side of the gender, as well as political, divide.
""In that era, male and female athletes in the same team were treated differently,"" she says.
""We were just not considered as important. We would get expenses by going up to a table and getting an envelope. Some of the other athletes went to a better table to get their expenses. There was a 'jobs for the boys' culture.""
But what they got back from the Friendship Games couldn't be counted in pounds. 
Neither Mitchell nor Hepher ever went to an Olympics. For them, a forgotten corner of track history remains a high point.
""It's not recognised, even within the athletics community, as being what it was,"" says Hepher. 
""It hasn't got the same sort of kudos as the Olympics. But looking back now, even if at the time I didn't realise the magnitude, I feel honoured to be part of it.
""I look back on it as my Olympics."""	/sport/athletics/58822355
politics	How big-bang economic plan and political turmoil sank Liz Truss	"Liz Truss came to power promising a new economic and political era. It is 45 days since she became PM - the shortest premiership in British history.
Yet that period saw an historic economic gamble, an almost unthinkable number of U-turns and the junking of an entire political programme. It's been short. But not simple.
Over the summer, it all felt very different. As we travelled around the UK for hustings, it was clear Ms Truss was highly popular with Conservative members.
Her promises to slash tax and govern as a Conservative were exactly what they wanted to hear. She wasn't a flawless media performer, but she knew how to work a friendly crowd.
re were warnings from former Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his supporters that her economic plans were risky and could backfire. Some said it would be electoral suicide. But they lost the argument in the Conservative Party.
With victory imminent, along with her close friend and political ally Kwasi Kwarteng, Ms Truss got to work on formulating a plan for power which would be radical and bold. 
rip up the rules, which had been followed by previous Tory prime ministers. The economic ""orthodoxy"" was to go out the window. The pair prepared what aides called a ""big bang"" of measures - to hit the ground running.
""We are not going to be tinkering at the edges,"" a senior figure in Team Truss boasted.
Ms Truss modelled herself on former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Her allies said that like the former prime minister, Ms Truss would be resolute in power; the lady wasn't for turning. 
made it clear she would make unpopular decisions and stick with them, whatever happened. Ms Truss wanted to be the new Iron Lady.
Within 48 hours came the first of a series of bold economic gambles, which went considerably further than almost everyone expected.
First there was the energy support package, which promised to cap the unit price for two years. For a candidate who had said there would be no more handouts, political reality had hit and the cheque book had been opened.
But within hours of being in Downing Street, politics had to take a back seat.
Ms Truss was told in the House of Commons that the Queen was ill. By the end of the day, a prime minister in office for two days was on the steps of Downing Street paying tribute to the longest-serving monarch in British history. Over the next few days, the government's focus was firmly on national mourning.
After the Queen's funeral though, Ms Truss had to make up for lost time. She went on her first and only major diplomatic trip to the United Nations in New York, where she told broadcasters she was prepared to make difficult decisions in pursuit of economic growth.
On her return came the economic ""big bang"" she had been thinking about for years.
Her mini-budget - which was anything but mini - was the most radical in recent history; taxes were slashed, particularly for the higher paid. It would be funded by borrowing, despite warnings that could make inflation worse.
Senior figures in Number 10 believed they were about to launch a bright new era for the UK economy. Economic libertarians had their chance and they were determined to take it.
One told me: ""Something different and bold needs to be done.""
m Truss believed the markets would give the country space to restructure the economy. But within days - it became clear they had been wrong and the wheels started to fall off their economic experiment. 
re were few details on how the government would fund the package, which left financial markets reeling, sent the pound plummeting, and forced the Bank of England to bail out pensions funds.
ry MPs began to panic quickly. Within 72 hours of the mini-budget, many were making it clear that they were unhappy. Conservative MPs spoke privately of the government already provoking a political crisis.
Over the coming week, that would only increase until a full-blown crisis emerged at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. By the time Ms Truss arrived, it was clear there was a significant rebellion brewing on the decision to scrap the 45p top rate of tax.
Under pressure from backbench MPs, Ms Truss buckled. The same day, she told the BBC she would not change her mind - she did. She sent the chancellor out to explain the decision.
U-turn was supposed to show that Ms Truss was listening. Number 10 believed it would allow rebellious MPs to move on. Instead, it did the exact opposite; rebels smelled blood. ""It feels like the last days of Rome,"" remarked one former minister.
Over the next few weeks, Ms Truss's authority collapsed completely. 
She sacked her chancellor and scrapped a plan to keep corporation tax down. She appointed Jeremy Hunt to run the Treasury - someone who had backed Mr Sunak.
Mr Hunt decided on Saturday that the whole economic strategy had to go and told the prime minister at Chequers the next day. Weakened by events, she had little option but to agree.
""Jeremy Hunt is de facto PM,"" said one MP, speaking for many. ""I don't see the point of her,"" added another.
By Sunday, the wheels were in motion for the end of Ms Truss's premiership. The BBC contacted many MPs and the mood was dark. Nobody was suggesting Ms Truss's authority would recover. One Ms Truss loyalist told me: ""We've lost"".
A senior party figure added as the mood turned: ""People know that this is over. It's a question of how and when.""
re was however, still a ray of hope for Ms Truss. 
Some MPs were nervous about bringing the prime minister down without having a unity candidate to replace her. They feared it would mean even more chaos, which nobody would be able to control. 
Some of the PM's internal critics urged caution. As one senior figure put it to me: Ms Truss's future might be decided by what her opponents can't do at this stage.
But what followed was even more humiliation.
On Monday, Mr Hunt took control and junked the economic plan. The prime minister was widely ridiculed for not speaking herself in Parliament. She dodged an urgent question from the Labour leader, then sat beside the chancellor briefly as he ripped up her economic plan in the Commons.
A couple of days later, the home secretary resigned over a breach of the ministerial code - but launched a blistering attack on the prime minister and her programme.
re was trouble brewing on the right of the party, which had campaigned so vigorously for Ms Truss over summer. And yet Prime Minister's Questions had ended without disaster, buying Ms Truss at least a few more hours.
final straw for Conservative MPs was the chaos over a vote on banning fracking. MPs were told it was confidence vote - that by not voting with the government, they were saying they didn't want it to continue. Then they were told it wasn't a confidence issue. Then they were told it was - and those who rebelled would be disciplined.
It all meant that by Thursday morning, the Conservative Party had decisively turned. When the prime minister summoned Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee, to test the mood of the party, it was game over.
w economic era was over. Twenty-four hours after saying she was a fighter, she had resigned. Ms Truss had failed, her ""big bang"" plan in tatters.
urmoil has defined Ms Truss's time in office. But it has also helped define 2022. In less than one year, there have been four chancellors, and by next week there will have been three prime ministers. 
Conservatives now have to choose a leader they think can bring stability. Whoever it is will want to last a lot longer than Ms Truss."	/news/uk-politics-63335671
health	Oliver Dowden firm on pay as nurses warn of more strikes	"Oliver Dowden: Unions please call off strikes
government has said it is ""resolute"" on pay after nursing unions threatened to escalate strike action if ministers do not join talks within 48 hours of Tuesday's walkout.
Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) are due to stage a second strike on 20 December.
Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden insisted ministers were ""reasonable"" but had a duty to keep finances under control.
He insisted that nurses' pay should be decided by the NHS pay review body.
In July, this body recommended a £1,400 rise, with slightly more for experienced nurses - an increase of about 4% on average.
RCN is calling for a pay rise of 19%, but union leader Pat Cullen said this was a ""starting point"" and any new offer would be put to members.
Urging the unions to call off the strike, Mr Dowden told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: ""We will be resolute to this, because it would be irresponsible to allow public sector pay and inflation to get out of control and we owe a wider duty to the public to make sure we keep our public finances under control.""
Challenged about the government's reluctance to engage on pay, the cabinet minister in charge of contingency planning for strikes, said the government was ""always willing talk"".
""We're trying to be reasonable, we're trying to be proportionate and we're trying to be fair,"" he said.
He added that the government was trying to ""take the politics out"" of the issue of pay by accepting the NHS review body's recommendations.
But Ms Cullen says ministers are using the recommendations as ""cover"" and her union was ""seriously looking at whether we take part anymore"".
""We have been hoodwinked into lending credence to this process for years and if we aren't being listened to then it cannot be independent,"" she added.
A small number of Conservative MPs have called on the government to revisit its offer to nurses. The latest to do so, former minister Caroline Nokes, called for the government to take ""another look at the negotiations"". 
Some Tories, including former cabinet minister Robert Buckland, have also said the pay review body should be asked to make fresh recommendations.
Mr Dowden repeated the government's claim that inflation-matching pay rises across the public sector would cost a further £28bn - insisting the figure was ""robust"" despite criticism from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank who provided a figure of half of this.
Labour-run Welsh government, which is responsible for the NHS in Wales, has also accepted the pay review's recommendations, saying it was taking this decision to protect spending.
On Sunday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the UK government had not given it a big enough budget to pay for a higher increase, and funding a rise from its existing budget would reduce treatment for patients.
In Northern Ireland, the power-sharing government would normally negotiate pay but is suspended due to a political stalemate over post-Brexit rules.
Scottish government has offered NHS workers pay rises averaging 7.5% in a bid to avoid industrial action. It has been accepted by Unite and Unison, two major NHS unions representing paramedics, midwives, nurses and support staff. However, it has been rejected by another, the GMB.
Meanwhile, a ballot of RCN members in Scotland closes on Monday. It is not clear when results will be announced.
RCN's strike on Thursday was the largest in its history. Across England around 9,999 staff were absent, while nearly 16,000 appointments, procedures and surgeries were rescheduled. 
It involved around a quarter of hospitals and community teams in England, all trusts in Northern Ireland and all but one health board in Wales. 
Ms Cullen said an escalation would involve a greater number of hospitals and scaling back support for non-emergency services.
During action so far, the RCN has said it will still staff chemotherapy, emergency cancer services, dialysis, critical care units, neonatal and paediatric intensive care.
Some areas of mental health and learning disability and autism services are also exempt.
urses will be followed on 21 December by a strike by ambulance staff, when Unison, GMB and Unite members take action on 28 December. GMB union members will go on strike again on 28 December.
Around 1,200 members of the military are being drafted in to cover for ambulance workers, as well as striking Border Force staff.
However, health unions warn military staff are not ""sufficiently trained"".
Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, said there was ""unfortunately more risk"" to patients during a strike, but said: ""Every single day patients are being put at risk because of the staffing crisis"".
Chief of the Defence Staff's words are carefully calibrated.
When asked about the strikes, he does not criticise the government for calling in the armed forces, nor those who're taking industrial action.
Admiral Sir Tony Radakin knows the armed forces must stay out of politics and he makes clear the military is there to serve the nation, whatever the task. 
But his words do reflect some of the frustration within the armed forces at once again being called out to do someone else's job. It's by no means the first time. 
were heavily relied on during the Covid pandemic. In 2012 they had to provide security for the London Olympics.  
When asked about the strike action, the head of the armed forces reminds the public that's not their primary role - it's to defend the nation. 
Being pulled away to fulfil other roles can often have an impact on training, although it will not affect military operations. 
Admiral Radakin's comments do reflect frustration, rather than anger over what they're being asked to do. He also knows that when the armed forces help out most people are grateful.
Industrial action has also been taken by rail workers, Royal Mail staff and other sectors in recent weeks over pay disputes as the cost of living rises.
government has announced it will publish a new ""resilience framework"" on Monday, aimed at improving how the UK prepares for and responds to critical issues like strikes.

sports	Chippenham's fully accessible centre 'one-of-a-kind'	"A state-of-the-art skate park and climbing centre has helped to make local sports more inclusive, according to residents.
Para-climber Mary Meilton, 23, said she was ""buzzing"" when The Arc's fully accessible facility opened last month.
""Inclusion means disabled and non-disabled sport side-by-side,"" she added.
urpose-built facility in Chippenham, Wiltshire, offers bouldering, roped climbing, and a cafe.
Local residents had spent 18 years campaigning for a skate park in Wiltshire's largest town, which it was said ""suffers from a lack of investment"".
Phil Tansley from the Chippenham Borough Lands Charity which built the £2.9m facility said the skate park had always been a ""contentious subject"". 
""There are those that want it, there are those that don't want it, those who think it brings anti-social behaviour, those who don't want it in their back gardens.""
He said this one was able to be built because it is locked up with the rest of the centre at the end of the day, reducing the chance of anti-social behaviour. 
Arc is one of the first climbing centres in the UK to be built from the ground-up, rather than adapted from existing space.
""We wanted to really push the boat out and put Chippenham on the mark but also offer the people of Chippenham something you don't usually get in a market town,"" added Mr Tansley.
He added that despite being the county's largest town, Chippenham did not receive enough investment, hence the charity funding the project.
Ms Meilton, who has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, said she had previously travelled to Swindon or Bristol to climb.
Her disability means she can sometimes only climb for 20 minutes at once. 
""When you're driving for two hours for a 20-minute session.. it wasn't working very well.""
""I'd always said 'I love Chippenham but the one thing it's missing is a climbing centre'.
""When they said they were opening it I was like right, I'm happy to live here forever now!""
She said The Arc was one of the only centres she had been to that had a lift. 
""Which isn't rocket science, but people think because you can climb a wall you can climb the stairs but that's not necessarily the case.""
Ms Meilton said the facility would be great for local people's physical and mental health. 
""When you're on the wall the only thing you can be thinking about is climbing and the wall.""
She said disability and climbing were not always put together but that the para-climbing community was actually ""huge"".
""To have a fully accessible climbing centre creates an atmosphere of inclusion and puts greater value in our community. 
""We're legitimate climbers in our own rights, our bodies just move a little differently to everyone else.
""We don't need to be separated and have special groups and special clubs.""
Local skater Jon Wills praised the new skate park, which he said would stop the public from seeing younger skaters as a nuisance in public places. 
He said he now uses the centre alongside his children who were ""very excited to start a new hobby rock climbing"".
finishing touches to the site are still to be completed, including a children's play park. 
re will be officially opened with a ceremony on 9 April, attended by Gloucestershire-based Mount Everest climber Kenton Cool.

sports	Canoe Slalom World Cup: Britain's Mallory Franklin takes overall extreme slalom title	"Britain's Mallory Franklin clinched the overall extreme slalom title at the final Canoe Slalom World Cup event of the season in La Seu, Spain.
Olympic silver medallist, 28, won the final to move her from seventh to first in the overall standings.
Earlier she finished second overall in the C1 category, having secured silver in the K1 on Saturday.
""It's pretty crazy really, but I'm really happy with how I paddled,"" Franklin, 28, said.
Franklin had failed to make the C1 final but had done enough to secure the runners-up spot, with Tereza Fiserova of the Czech Republic taking the overall title.
Fiserova also finished second in the extreme slalom.
On Saturday Franklin was ninth in the K1 final but finished behind Australia's Jessica Fox - who beat the Brit to gold in Tokyo last summer.
""It's a bit of an odd one really, in the sense that I obviously didn't have the best weekend's racing this weekend or last weekend,"" added Franklin.
""It's cool to end up second (in C1) but it's a bit weird feeling as it feels like - as it kind of is - that people's results fell in a good way for me. 
""Being able to be up on that podium is a testament to my consistency over the year and the level that I've been putting in, and even when I'm not at my best still being able to maintain a bit.
""I'm really happy with ending up on the podium. It's really cool and I think it says a lot about my consistency this year."""	/sport/canoeing/62785610
health	Linden Centre: Jayden Booroff's abscond risk not recorded - inquest	"A 23-year-old man who died after fleeing a mental health unit was not properly recorded as being an ""absconding risk"", an inquest heard.
Jayden Booroff absconded from the Linden Centre in Chelmsford, Essex, on 23 October 2020.
Patient safety investigator Paul Binyon told Essex Coroner's Court that written care notes showed he was an ""absconding risk and an impulsivity risk"".
Jurors heard this was missing from the SBAR electronic forms used by staff.
Mr Booroff, described as a talented musician, had been sectioned twice at the point he left the Linden Centre's Finchingfield Ward shortly after 19:45 BST.
His body was found near Chelmsford railway station about two hours later.
quest heard he had a history of undiagnosed mental health issues and was being given anti-psychotic medication.
Mr Binyon's serious incident investigation, on behalf of the Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, noted that staff observations of Mr Booroff were reduced two days before his death, from four times per hour to once per hour, which did not follow a ""detailed plan"".
""The heightened level of engagement leading to the incident may have given opportunity to detect behaviours, such as an unusual interest in exit routes, which may have indicated an impending attempt to abscond,"" he said on Thursday.
urt was told a nurse tried to ""grab"" Mr Booroff as he fled the unit, but that she had left her Pinpoint security alarm, used for alerting colleagues, in her car after arriving late to her shift.
report outlined nine similar incidents between 2017 and 2020 where inpatients ""tailgated"" staff out of unclosed doors.
""Lessons learnt had not been completed [on incident forms] leading the investigation to find that risk tolerance had been bound in favour of accepting the inevitability of absconding,"" said Mr Binyon.
""There were missed opportunities to learn from patient safety incidents.""
matron at the time of Mr Booroff's absconding previously told jurors that staff would always discuss what ""they've learnt"" from each incident.
wo-week inquest is due to conclude on Friday.

health	Ulster Hospital: Bed pressures 'worse than during Covid'	"Emergency department situation 'worse than during Covid'
urrent pressure on hospital beds is ""worse than it was during Covid"", according to a senior manager at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.
Seaneen Pettigrew works in the hospital's discharge hub and her role is to free up beds by facilitating the discharge of medically-fit patients.
She said they were having difficulty securing care in the community for vulnerable patients leaving hospital.
Ms Pettigrew said demand for carers ""is currently outstripping supply"".
""We've more patients attending emergency department (ED), we've more patients coming through the hospital and more patients with complex needs who are needing more support on discharge than maybe previously,"" she said.
BBC News NI was granted access to the hospital's discharge hub this week, as well as its emergency department.
On Wednesday afternoon, 135 patients were in the emergency department, with 50 of those waiting for admission to a ward.
At the same time, there were 67 patients in the hospital who were ready to be discharged into the community, but could not leave because of delays securing onward care. 
One patient, who required admission to the hospital, had been waiting nearly 60 hours in the emergency department.
Seven ambulances were also waiting outside with patients onboard.
Andrew Dobbin, a consultant at the Ulster Hospital, warned that patients waiting long periods in emergency departments to be admitted are ""going to come to harm"".
He said there was ""almost a one-in-one out-policy"" due to delays discharging medically-fit patients.
Dr Dobbin said it had become normal to see 50 patients waiting in the department for admission to wards and for hospital staff to be under ""significant pressure"".
""We know, as our Royal College of Emergency Medicine has said, that crowding and long waits in emergency departments are directly linked to harm for patients and we know that patients staying here for long periods of time are going to come to harm.""
He added there were two reasons why emergency departments were facing ""significant problems"".
""The first thing is demand has increased and the second problem, which is the main problem at the moment, is that we have a significant number of patients who need to continue their care in hospital that we cannot move through our system to create the capacity to run an efficient, safe, effective emergency department.""
In the hospital's discharge hub a team of nurses, social workers, administrative staff and occupational therapists work seven days a week sourcing suitable placements for patients who are ready to leave hospital. 
Ms Pettigrew told BBC News NI that the ""picture is worse than it was during Covid"" because of the demand.
""The challenges we are having would be in accessing domiciliary care and sourcing appropriate care homes to facilitate patient discharge, and as a result those patients are delayed in hospital awaiting their care package or care home.""
Ms Pettigrew said the team at the discharge hub were appealing to patients and their families to work with them. 
""Given the challenges we may have to look at an alternative interim bed to go to, to await your package or await your home of choice.
""We know its not ideal, but it frees up the hospital bed for those patients waiting to come in through ED to also get the treatment that your loved one will have had.""
rge hub manager said there was a need to increase the number of care workers both within care homes and the domiciliary care sector. 
""It is a very complex issue within domiciliary care, the demand for the service is outstripping what's available at the minute.
""And then within our care home sector it is the appropriate care home placements for patients - potentially those who have complex nursing needs, complex behavioural needs.  It's trying to source the right placements for those patients,"" Ms Pettigrew explained. 
Separately, the number of people waiting for a first appointment with a consultant increased by 20,000 in a year, according to the latest figures from the Department of Health. 
More than 375,000 people were waiting to see a specialist at the end of September, up more than 5% from the same time last year.
Department of Health said its target by March next year is that at least 50% of people should not be waiting any longer than nine weeks for a first outpatient appointment.
urrent number of patients waiting longer than nine weeks is 82%, with over half of people on a waiting list for more than a year.
figures also show that almost 124,000 people were waiting to be admitted to hospital for inpatient or day care treatment.
And almost 164,000 patients were still waiting for a diagnostic test at the end of September - up 11% on the same time last year."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63746844

politics	Labour 20,000 homes pledge may now include renovations	"Soaring costs mean some old homes might be renovated instead of only building new ones to hit Welsh Labour's social housing pledge, ministers have admitted.
Labour's manifesto promised ""20,000 new low carbon social homes for rent"".
But the finance minister said her budget had not kept up with rising prices and it could also affect plans to build schools in Wales.
Capital funding - which pays for building work - has been squeezed hard.
As a result, some things might take longer, Rebecca Evans told the Senedd's finance committee, the day after unveiling her budget.
Ms Evans told the government may not be ""looking at all new homes now"".
""We could be looking at homes which are brought up to standard or further empty homes brought into use, and so on.""
A commitment to spend £1.5bn building schools would be honoured, but ""inevitably we are not going to get so much for that money"".
She added: ""There will be parts of the budget where we are just simply not able to deliver as much as we originally intended.""
mmittee heard the cost of building schools had grown 15%.
""That means you're kind of getting 15% less school for you money this year, compared to last year,"" Welsh government Treasury director Andrew Jeffreys said.
uesday's budget confirmed that capital spending will stay flat next year and will not keep up with inflation. 
means the budget could really be worth 8% less in 2023-24 because of rising prices.

entertainment	Avatar: The Way Of Water passes $1bn at the global box office	"Avatar: The Way Of Water has made $1bn (£831m) at the global box office in just 14 days, becoming the fastest film to pass the milestone this year.
g-delayed sequel has proved a hit with audiences despite wildly varying reviews.
It is one of only three films to surpass $1bn this year, after Top Gun: Maverick and Jurassic World Dominion.
However, director James Cameron has said his technologically innovative movie needs to make $2bn to break even.
film picks up after the events of 2009's Avatar, which is the highest-grossing film of all time, with box office receipts of $2.97 billion (£2.47 billion).
Analysts say the new instalment is unlikely to beat that figure, as cinema attendances are still down, post-pandemic.
But based on current performance, the film is likely to overtake Top Gun: Maverick as the biggest film of 2022.
ws may come as a surprise to critics, some of whom panned The Way Of Water as a ""lumbering, humourless damp squib of a movie"" in which ""nothing meaningful happens"" and ""the story is really pretty stupid"".
Others were more enthusiastic, calling the film an ""eye-popping, jaw-dropping spectacle"" and a ""fully immersive waking dream"".
riginal Avatar was essentially a science-fiction version of Pocahontas - following the story of greedy, colonialist humans stripping the resources of a distant planet called Pandora. 
It was told through the eyes of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a human soldier who fell in love with a native warrior called Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), and came to recognise the importance of Pandora's delicately balanced ecosystem.
quel is set several years later, as Sully and Neytiri head under water to protect their planet from another human invasion while attempting to raise a family.
re is a lot riding on its box office performance, as it is the first of four planned sequels, with future instalments coming in 2024, 2026 and 2028.
Cameron shot the third movie in tandem with The Way Of Water, as well as ""a little bit"" of the fourth to ensure his child actors still looked the right age.
""I love Stranger Things, but you get the Stranger Things effect where they're supposed to still be in high school, and they look like they're 27,"" he said.
In Avatar four, the child actors ""age six years in the middle of the story on page 25,"" he explained, ""so I needed [to shoot] everything before then, and then everything after, we'll do later.""
rector, whose other credits include Terminator, Titanic and The Abyss, has admitted that his plans will be dictated by the films' profitability.
""The market could be telling us we're done in three months, or we might be semi-done, meaning: 'Okay, let's complete the story within movie three, and not go on endlessly,' if it's just not profitable,"" he told Total Film magazine.
""We're in a different world now than we were when I wrote this stuff, even. It's the one-two punch - the pandemic and streaming. Or, conversely, maybe we'll remind people what going to the theatre is all about. This film definitely does that.""
As well as topping the global box office chart, The Way Of Water is also the UK's number one film, making £25.03 million in its first two weeks of release."	/news/entertainment-arts-64115028
technology	West Yorkshire Police: Receives 200 accidental emergency calls daily	"About 200 accidental 999 calls are being received by a police force every day.
West Yorkshire Police said pocket dialling and children playing on their parents' phones accounted for a number of the calls.
Staff said every emergency call needed investigation, sometimes requiring a personal visit, and misdials were adding to workloads.
force said it receives about 1,300 emergency calls a day.
Senior contact manager with the force, Tom Donahue, said the growing number of misdials came as they saw a 6% year-on-year rise in emergency calls.
""It can be very easy to pocket dial,"" Mr Donahue said.
""The problem for us is that every one of these calls needs to be investigated to make absolutely sure no-one is in danger.""
He said people were ""horrified and extremely apologetic"" once they were aware of the error.
Mr Donahue said it was also important people did not hang up if they realised they had dialled by mistake.
""A lot of the time parents of children who have dialled 999 accidentally will panic and hit 'end call'.
""We then have to ring them back.
""We would rather they stayed on the line and quickly told us everything was OK.""
When a caller dials 999, they are put through to the BT emergency operator who then directs calls to the most appropriate service.
BT does not have the resources to investigate all suspected misdials so they are put through to the police, Mr Donahue said.

But a number of MPs were in discussion about making formal complaints to Conservative head office unless Sir Gavin resigned, the BBC understands.
re now unlikely to do so.
Separately, the BBC understands that two formal complaints to Parliament's ""bullying watchdog"" - the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) - have been submitted.
Sir Gavin had a meeting with the prime minister on Tuesday - at his own instigation - at which he tendered his resignation. 
It was the first time the two men had discussed the allegations face-to-face.
Despite some reports that Sir Gavin had been ""forced"" to resign, neither No 10 nor sources close to the former cabinet office minister said Rishi Sunak asked for Sir Gavin's resignation. 
Complaints against Sir Gavin first emerged when The Sunday Times published a series of expletive-laden texts he sent last month to Ms Morton, the then-chief whip.
In the texts, he reportedly warns Ms Morton ""not to push him about"" and said that ""there is a price for everything"".
An official from the Ministry of Defence later told the Guardian that, during his time as defence secretary, Sir Gavin told them to ""slit your throat"" and, on another occasion, to ""jump out of the window"". 
On Tuesday, his former deputy, Anne Milton, also claimed he had behaved in a ""threatening"" and ""intimidating"" way towards MPs while serving as chief whip.
Ex-Conservative Party chairman Jake Berry has said he told Mr Sunak about Ms Morton's complaint on 24 October, the day before Sir Gavin's appointment.
In his resignation letter, Sir Gavin said claims about his conduct had become a ""distraction"" but defiantly vowed to ""clear my name of any wrongdoing"".
Sir Gavin said he refuted the ""characterisation"" of the claims ""about my past conduct"" but felt they had become a ""distraction from the good work the government is doing"".
He added that he had apologised to the recipient of the text messages and would comply with the complaints process.
In reply, Mr Sunak said he accepted the resignation ""with great sadness"" and thanked Sir Gavin for his ""personal support and loyalty"".
October 25: Mr Sunak becomes PM and appoints Sir Gavin to the cabinet as a minister without portfolio
November 5: Expletive-laden text messages sent by Sir Gavin to Ms Morton are published by the Sunday Times
November 6: Mr Sunak says the messages are ""not acceptable"" and acknowledges he is aware of a disagreement between Sir Gavin and Ms Morton
November 7: The PM says he will wait for the results of a complaints investigation into Sir Gavin ""before making any decisions about the future""
Later, a Guardian story claims Sir Gavin told a senior civil servant to ""slit your throat"", when he was defence secretary, something he denies.
November 8: Sir Gavin's texts to Ms Morton are referred to the ICGS, the parliamentary watchdog
Shortly after 20:00, Sir Gavin resigns claiming the allegations against him were becoming a distraction."	/news/uk-politics-63578525
technology	Aerospace electrified by new technology	"From a small office overlooking an airfield, once home to the UK's first Spitfire squadron, a tiny British start-up is hoping to make a little history of its own - as one of the pioneers of commercial electrified aviation.
Faradair is planning to develop and sell a hybrid-electric passenger plane, aimed at the regional aviation market. It would have up to 19 seats and would be propelled by a fan driven by an electric motor. The necessary electricity would be provided by a small gas turbine. 
In order to provide extra lift, and allow take-offs and landings from short runways, it would also have a triple level wing. This would give it a passing resemblance to a World War One fighter, despite having state-of-the-art aerodynamics.
mpany's chief executive, Neil Cloughley, argues that such a plane would have far fewer moving parts than a conventional propeller aircraft, making it cheaper to run. It would also be much quieter, and produce fewer emissions.
""Why do we not use aeroplanes like we would a bus?"" he asks.
""The reason is cost of operation, primarily. Also if you start using lots of aeroplanes it creates a lot of noise, and of course we have now got into an age where sustainability really is a key part of our future.
""So we decided we would come up with an aircraft that would not only be economic to use, and therefore cost-effective, but would also be quiet and sustainable.""
Faradair design, he says, would allow short hops between cities such as London and Manchester for £25 each way - less than the cost of a rail ticket. 
In more remote or inaccessible regions, meanwhile, such planes could provide a transport lifeline from small airstrips, avoiding the need for major investments in road or rail lines.
It plans to have the aircraft flying by 2025 with commercial use starting in 2027.
Faradair is far from alone in seeing the potential of electric aviation, at a time when governments around the world are searching for ways to reduce carbon emissions. Nor is its project the most ambitious. 
California-based start-up Wright Electric, for example, plans to bring a fully-electric 100-seat aircraft into service by the middle of the decade. It would be based on the existing Bae146, with its four turbofan engines replaced by electric motors. 
mpany, which has a partnership with Easyjet, says the aircraft would be used to carry out one-hour flights, allowing it to serve routes such as London-Paris, New York-Washington or Hong Kong-Taipei.
More technology of business:
However, in testing, the plane will run as a hybrid. Initially just one of the four engines will be replaced by an electric motor, with others following if the tests are successful. 
According to Wright Electric's chief executive, Jeffrey Engler, potential customers think this is a good approach and one they could also follow when the aircraft enters production.
""When we spoke to the airlines, they said, 'Well why don't you go hybrid initially, instead of full electric from the start?'"" he explains.
""Just like the car industry started with hybrids as well. So that's something we're looking into.""
main reason electrifying aircraft is so difficult is that even the best batteries contain far less energy per kilogram than traditional aviation fuels, making them much too heavy to power an airliner over long distances.
""The specific energy of today's batteries is far from what you would need,"" explains Dr Andreas Strohmayer, head of the University of Stuttgart's Institute of Aircraft Design.
Institute has been researching the potential of electric and hybrid aviation since the mid-1990s, and first flew its own experimental two-seater electric plane, the e-Genius, more than a decade ago.  
""We build our own battery systems for our electric aircraft,"" he explains
""We are getting in the region of 200 watt [hours] per kilogram, where we would need 1,000 or 1,500. So we are far from what we would need for a large aircraft.""
His view is that small, light electric aircraft, of up to six seats can be built with today's technology.
He also believes it should be possible to build a larger commuter aircraft, with up to 19 seats while still relying purely on battery power, though it would be ""at the edge of what is currently possible"".
Alice, a nine-seater plane being developed by Israeli firm Eviation, would fit into this category. The aircraft, which has been under development for several years, has been designed to fly up to 600 miles, purely on electric power.
Anything larger, meanwhile, would need to be a hybrid, combining electric motors with conventional engines or on-board generators.
For Dr Strohmayer the potential is there for both types of aircraft to create new aviation networks, with small all-electric planes delivering passengers on short hops from local airfields to regional hubs. There, larger hybrid aircraft would be available to carry them on journeys of up to 500km.
""It would be a denser aviation network,"" he explains.
""It would be of most use in regions like Scandinavia or in mountainous areas, where you can't really just build networks of high-speed railways.
""There are places like Indonesia, Polynesia, where you have all these islands that have to be connected. There are places in the world where such networks are desperately needed.""
Eviation is planning its first test flights of Alice this summer.
But such technology is unlikely to be much use over long-distance routes and that may explain why the European aerospace giant Airbus has decided its own priorities lie elsewhere.
In 2017, the company began developing a prototype hybrid plane, the E-Fan X, in partnership with Rolls-Royce and Siemens. Like Wright Electric's project, it was based on the existing Bae146. 
But three years later, the programme was cancelled. Dr Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus Upnext, the division responsible for researching new technologies, thinks it was the right decision.
""Our focus is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050,"" she says. ""In order to achieve that we need to look at two different technologies, associated with different time horizons.""
In the short term, to reduce emissions, the company is focusing on using sustainable aviation fuels made from renewable sources and waste.
Beyond that, Airbus has its sights fixed firmly on using hydrogen to power a new generation of clean aircraft.
""Our ambition is to bring the first zero-emission commercial aircraft based on hydrogen to the market in 2035,"" she explains.
""I already have teams working on cryogenic and superconducting technologies. We are already exploring what will come next."""	/news/business-62120130

Lilia and her mother Polly Petrova from Marlborough, Wiltshire, started a business called Lilia's Smiling Horses in April 2020.
""Lilia loves riding horses, she's been riding horses since she was two,"" Ms Petrova said. 
""The first line of toys that we made were a line of horses with smiles on their faces,"", said Ms Petrova.
Lilia said that seeing her drawings become toys was ""exciting and a dream come true"".
Wanting other children to experience the joy of seeing their drawings become toys, the mother and daughter duo began offering the service to others, with Ms Petrova admitting that her daughter is a ""bit of a control freak"" when helping, in order to make sure the toys look similar to the original drawing.
""She is constantly supervising, she is very outspoken and always has an opinion"", Ms Petrova, who works in the medical centre at Marlborough College, said.
""You know how artists are with their art, and she wants to make sure everything goes to plan, so is very involved with the whole thing.
""It is also a hobby for both of us that we love to do and gives us valuable bonding time together.""
Lilia added that being part of the process is ""satisfying, especially the part when we send them to the kids - I feel proud and accomplished"".
A toy that really ""stood out"" for Ms Petrova and her daughter was a ""memory toy"" they made using the last drawing of a young girl before she died - a little princess with hearts.
""It was a gift from her aunt to her mum - and it got emotional for me and I did all that I could to make it as good as possible"", Ms Petrova said.

politics	EU moves to ensure animal medicine supplies	"Current post-Brexit arrangements to ensure the continued availability of veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland are to be extended.  
A ""grace period"" had been due to expire at the end of this year. 
A group of MPs had warned this would mean a risk of shortages in veterinary drugs, including vaccines and anaesthetics for operations. 
However, on Monday the EU's chief Brexit negotiator confirmed the grace period will be extended to 2025. 
Maros Sefcovic said the EU Commission had ""taken steps to ensure the continuity of supplies of veterinary medicines to Northern Ireland, but also Cyprus, Ireland and Malta"". 
It means businesses will be still able to buy medicines from within the UK. 
rotocol means Northern Ireland is still inside the EU's pharmaceutical regulatory system.
However it gets most of its medicines from Great Britain, which is not.
Earlier this year, the EU changed its laws in an effort to help guarantee supplies of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but that arrangement did not cover veterinary medicines.
Mr Sefcovic said extending the grace period to the end of December 2025 was ""a practical solution to a practical problem"" and would allow ""ample time to adapt"".
UK's Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the announcement brings greater clarity to the veterinary industry in Northern Ireland.
resident of the British Veterinary Association, Malcolm Morley, said the sector was delighted by the announcement.  
""The extension of the grace period is extremely positive, and we welcome a solution which provides ample time to adapt for future compliance. 
""Our thanks go to our BVA NI Branch officers, who all worked incredibly hard to help secure a positive resolution to this serious issue.""
Ulster Farmers' Union president David Brown said work would continue to ensure the continuing supply of the full portfolio of veterinary medicines.  
""The implications of achieving anything less will be hugely damaging for animal health and welfare in NI, and local food production at a time when we need to be sustaining and developing food security to meet the rising demand for food,"" he said.
""Although the full detail of the extension is not yet known, the UFU will keep working on the matter, with the aim of securing a permanent solution.""
Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director, said:""UK and EU negotiators have shown pragmatism here, but the extended time must be well-spent in securing a lasting, practical solution to this problem.""  "	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64027133
technology	WhatsApp: Mark Zuckerberg reveals new privacy features	"Meta has announced new privacy features for WhatsApp users. 
Users will be able to leave group chats silently, control who can see their online status and block screenshots on View Once messages.
Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said this would help keep WhatsApp messaging ""as private and secure as face-to-face conversations"". 
It will begin rolling out the features this month, highlighting them in a global campaign, starting in the UK.
ular messaging app currently alerts all members of a group chat to someone leaving or being removed by default. 
And while there are ways to disable this for individual group chats, the option to leave silently is not presented to users when they choose to ""exit group"" - sometimes causing awkwardness, embarrassment or drama for those trying to leave unnoticed.
With the recent changes, users will be able to leave without notifying the other group chat users, only alerting group administrators.
Product head Ami Vora said it was part of the platform's focus on ""building product features that empower people to have more control and privacy over their messages"".
""We believe WhatsApp is the most secure place to have a private conversation,"" she said.
""No other global messaging service at this scale provides this level of security for their users' messages, media, voice messages, video calls, and chat back-ups.""
update will also see users given the option to allow only certain contacts - or no-one - to see when they are active on the platform, bringing online status options into alignment with ""last seen"" settings.  
Janis Wong, research associate at The Alan Turing Institute, told BBC News: ""It's always nice to give users more control - users like, and need to have, more control.""
But unless users were prompted to use the features, or made fully aware of them in the app, their impact could be limited, she noted. 
""If it's not default, or if users aren't prompted to reconsider their options, then it's not necessarily very useful - if users aren't aware this is something that they can do,"" she said.
On Tuesday, Snap also announced new app features for instant image-sharing, as well as updates to the messaging app Snapchat.
mpany has launched a Family Centre, which builds on child safety measures by allowing parents to have more oversight of their child's experience on the app.
However, this will only be implemented once parents and Snapchat users have both accepted invites to the supervisory hub. 
Family Centre tools include letting parents see who their child is friends with and chatting to, but parents will not be able to view message content.
Jacqueline Beauchere, global head of platform safety at Snapchat, said the Family Centre aims to provide parents with ""a window into their teen's online life"".
""For parents, we know understanding how their teens are interacting online is important,"" she said. ""We hope these tools will empower both parents and teens, and boost online safety and wellbeing.""
-app Family Centre will also let parents independently report users interacting with their child or engaging in concerning behaviour on Snapchat. 
From autumn, teen users will be able to notify parents of any accounts or content which they have reported. "	/news/technology-62464243
politics	Stormont: Resolve protocol issues to avoid election - DUP	"government should focus on negotiations with the EU over the Northern Ireland Protocol instead of calling an election, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader said there had been ""little focus"" on dealing with the issue due to political chaos at Westminster.
rty has refused to return to power-sharing at Stormont.
Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill accused the DUP of hiding behind the protocol.
Northern Ireland is on course for an election after politicians missed the deadline set by Westminster for restoring the Stormont executive.
Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, now must call an election to be held within 12 weeks.
On Sunday evening, he said he would meet Sinn Féin, the DUP, the Alliance Party and the Ulster Unionist Party on Tuesday.
""The duty to call an election is not one I bear lightly, and I will be outlining to the parties that the people of Northern Ireland deserve a strong and accountable government,"" he said. 
""There are a number of things I could do, including taking action on MLA pay, which I know many people feel is deeply unfair while the assembly is unable to function fully. 
""I am also concerned by the issues within the Stormont budget and will address these urgently with my officials and those from the Northern Ireland civil service.""
Sir Jeffrey told Sky News he wanted to see the assembly restored as soon as possible, but a new election would not resolve the deadlock.
rotocol is part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with some EU trade rules.
was designed to ensure goods could move freely across the Irish land border, from the UK into an EU member state, the Republic of Ireland.
However, it also created a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses.
DUP said the protocol had undermined Northern Ireland's position within the UK and the party collapsed the Northern Ireland Executive, which is similar to the UK cabinet, in February.
An election in May saw Sinn Féin become the first nationalist party to win the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly. 
Sinn Féin to nominate a first minister for the first time.
Also speaking to Sky News, Ms O'Neill said it was not lost on the wider public that the DUP did not like the election results and they had ""difficulty"" entering an executive led by her party.
""The DUP hide behind the issues of the protocol,"" she said.
""What I want to see in the time ahead is very mature, sensible political discussion between the British government and the EU side. Let's find an agreed way to solve the issues around the protocol.
""The protocol is a necessity and it is here to stay. There are things that can be smoothed out, there are things that can be made to work better and I up for that and I hope that is what we achieve.""
She urged the negotiations to continue in ""earnest and be ramped up"".
An agreement would ""provide certainty and stability, and would remove any pretence from the DUP in terms of forming an executive with myself and the rest of the parties,"" she added.
Sir Jeffrey denied his party was reluctant to enter a new executive with a Sinn Féin first minister, and said he withdrew his ministers in February before the election outcome in May.
He summed up the last six months since the election: ""We've had three prime ministers, Westminster has been in chaos, there's been little of focus on getting a solution to the protocol. 
""The talks with the EU only resumed a couple of weeks ago, and even then only at a technical level.""
He urged the UK government to ""double down on either getting a negotiated solution with the EU or bringing forward the legislation in Parliament that will resolve the issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol"".
Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which is currently with the House of Lords, would give the UK government unilateral powers to change the operation and oversight of the protocol.
In recent weeks, the UK and EU have resumed technical talks aimed at reaching agreement on reforms to the protocol.
Officials have been discussing matters such as reducing the burden of customs administration.
On Friday, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly spoke to the EU's chief negotiator, Maros Sefcovic.
Mr Cleverley said the teams had agreed to speak again soon, while Mr Sefcovic said the EU was committed to finding joint solutions."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63445506
health	Children’s Tylenol in short supply - here’s what parents can do	"A severe season of cold and flu is leading to empty pharmacy shelves and thinning supplies of antibiotics in the US and other parts of the world.  
Parents are struggling to find children's versions of over-the-counter medicines like Ibuprofen and Tylenol as well as the antibiotic Amoxicillin.
Some major pharmacies are limiting customers' purchases to ensure everyone has access to the drugs. 
But there are a number of strategies for parents looking for help. 
Hillary Dalfonso, a mother to a toddler, wanted to take action after she learned her sick friend had to travel to four different stores in town to track down medication for her ill child. 
She started a Facebook group where parents could share posts highlighting which stores have the products in stock. She said she was inspired by such groups that popped up during the recent infant formula shortage in the US. 
""I'm hoping this group can do the same for parents to prevent the stress of running around, using gas while it's expensive and [losing] valuable time"" when dealing with a sick child, she said.
rug shortage is unusual, experts say.
""In most seasons, it is rare to experience shortages of these medications, especially as widespread as this,"" said Brandon Dionne, an associate clinical professor at Northeastern University School of Pharmacy in Boston, Massachusetts. 
Globally, countries have been battling an earlier and severe season of viruses, including the flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can be dangerous for young children. 
rwhelmed children's hospitals.  
Supplies were prepped to keep up with previous winter seasons, but the uptick in illnesses earlier in the season meant manufacturers fell behind, said Stephen Schondelmeyer, a professor in the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy.
Johnson & Johnson, which makes Children's Tylenol and Children's Motrin, told the BBC the company has not been experiencing widespread shortages of the products, but that they may be less readily available due to consumer demand caused by a difficult virus season. The company is maximising production capacity, a spokesperson said. 
Amoxicillin has been affected by the sickness season as well. Though Amoxicillin does not treat viruses, respiratory illnesses have caused an increase in secondary infections that the drug can treat. 
Fearing the shortage, some parents are hoarding over-the-counter medications, which experts say they should never do, as it makes the problem worse. 
CVS Pharmacy told the BBC it has had to limit each customer to two children's pain relief products to help ensure access to the drugs, while Walgreens said it has restricted online customers to six over-the-counter paediatric fever reducers.  
Dr Schondelmeyer said drug makers are beginning to catch up to market demands, but short supplies could persist for up to another month. 
US, Canada and parts of Europe are all dealing with children's medication shortages. 
More than a dozen states in the US had ""very high"" levels of respiratory illnesses last week, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
uthern states of Florida, Alabama and Mississippi as well as some states on the east coast, including Washington, DC, Virginia and North Carolina, have been hit hard by shortages, Dr Schondelmeyer says.
Public health experts say Americans should stay up to date on Covid-19 and flu shots to avoid respiratory infections. 
Parents should avoid giving children cold medicines besides Tylenol and Ibuprofen because they do not work well, said Sean O'Leary, chairman of the Committee on Infectious Diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
Parents can use other methods to make their children more comfortable, he said, including salt water nasal sprays and humidifiers for stuffy noses.
If parents struggle to find children's Tylenol and Ibuprofen for their children at the pharmacy, they should consult the pharmacist about other options, said Dr Schondelmeyer. 
Pharmacists can instruct parents on how to cut and crush adult dosage fever and pain relievers into child doses, but parents should never attempt to do this on their own. "	/news/world-us-canada-64034568

business	Cost-of-living payments branded insufficient as energy bills soar	"Ministers must offer bigger cost-of-living support payments as energy bills are expected to soar further this winter, a committee of MPs has said.
Financial help for the vulnerable and poor needed to be ""updated"" to reflect higher bills in October, they said.
Witnesses told the Business Committee: ""If you think things are bad now, you've not seen anything yet.""
Its report also called energy regulator Ofgem ""incompetent"". Ofgem said it was working hard to reform the market.
In recent days, millions of low-income households on benefits have been receiving the first £326 instalment of payments to assist with the rising cost of living.
Further payments will come later in the year, including extra support for pensioners and people with disabilities, and a £400 discount on everyone's domestic energy bill.
ments were set when the typical energy bill was anticipated to rise by £800 - a prediction Ofgem says is now too low. Influential industry analyst Cornwall Insight has predicted a rise of more than £1,200 a year in October, pushing the typical bill to £3,244 a year from October, then £3,363 a year from January.
How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch.
A normal bill at present is about £2,000 a year, which follows a £700 a year rise in April.
Business Committee's report said the government's support package was ""no longer sufficient""
""The impact of the energy price crisis on households is likely to cause an unacceptable rise in fuel poverty and hardship this winter,"" the report said. 
""The government must immediately update its support, targeting this at customers who are on low incomes, fuel poor, and in vulnerable circumstances, and develop a scheme to support vulnerable customers to accelerate the repayment of energy debt resulting from this crisis.""
mmittee has been hearing from experts, ministers and industry insiders for months.
""We were told by a number of witnesses, 'if you think things are bad now, you've not seen anything yet,'"" said Darren Jones, who chairs the committee.
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""No national government can control global inflationary pressures; however, we have introduced an extraordinary package of support to help households.""
wide-ranging report made a series of other recommendations, including:
Members of the Business Committee follow the Public Accounts Committee of MPs in heavily criticising regulator Ofgem for its role in allowing suppliers to set up and operate without sufficient oversight. It said there was too much focus on competition instead.
Owing to the failure of 29 companies, 2.4 million customers were moved to other suppliers, and often to more expensive tariffs, and one large supplier - Bulb - is in special administration.
""Ofgem has proved incompetent as the regulatory authority of the energy retail market over the last decade,"" the report said.
""It allowed suppliers to enter the market without ensuring they had access to sufficient capital, acceptable business plans, and were run by individuals with relevant expertise.""
A spokesman for Ofgem said the regulator had been ""clear and transparent"" that suppliers and its own regime had not been robust enough. 
""No regulator can, or should, guarantee companies will not fail in a competitive market but we are working hard to reform the entire market, as well as closely scrutinising and holding individual energy suppliers to account, to further strengthen the regulatory regime,"" he said.
mmittee also questioned the future of the price cap, which sets a limit on the cost of each unit of energy and the standing charge for domestic customers in England, Wales and Scotland.
It said the government should consider a social tariff instead for the most vulnerable, and then a relative tariff for everyone else.
Social tariffs were phased out by suppliers about a decade ago.
Prepayment meter customers, who pay for their energy in advance, have a different - slightly more expensive - price cap. Citizens Advice has warned that the number of people seeking help because they cannot afford to top up their meter has reached a new record.
known as self-disconnections and the committee said that Ofgem and suppliers should identify those at risk and allow them to pay for energy after they have used it.
MPs also called for an ""urgent, far-reaching, and long-term"" insulation programme for UK homes.
""Ultimately, the UK needs to reduce its dependence on imported gas. Energy efficiency is the quickest and most cost-effective way to reduce gas demand and lower energy bills,"" the report said.
Ofgem spokesman said: ""We are also working with all parts of government and industry on the long-term solution to the energy crisis by moving us away from imports of expensive gas towards a more secure, reliable, home-grown energy system."""	/news/business-62291652

business	Firms will close this winter without help, warns business group	"Businesses ""will close their doors this winter"" if they are not given support with soaring energy bills, the head of the British Chambers of Commerce says.
Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith said the government needed to provide measures on the same scale as at the height of the Covid pandemic to help firms.
She said the country needed an ""action plan"" to be delivered next week.
Her comments come as Chancellor Nadim Zahawi said companies could be given VAT reductions or other tax breaks.
mes reported Mr Zahawi has been working on a multi-billion pound emergency energy strategy for the new prime minister, who will be elected by the Conservative Party and take office on Monday.
Baroness Ruby, a Conservative peer, said the scale of support for businesses was going to have to be ""particularly considerable"" for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs).
Unlike households, businesses are not protected by an energy price cap, meaning their bills are usually higher. Pubs in particular are seeing their energy costs soar by as much as 300%, and bosses of six of the country's largest breweries have called for ""immediate government intervention"".
""One of the big measures we are asking for, and have been for some time, is for Covid-style support to be given by measure of a government emergency energy grant for all SMEs,"" said Baroness Ruby.
""I think unless there is immediate and urgent support, we will see many businesses close their doors this winter.""Warning firms will close this winter without help
BCC president said measures reportedly suggested by Mr Zahawi, including reductions in VAT and business rates for retail and hospitality and tax breaks for energy intensive industries, was the ""right territory"" to help people this winter.
""We cannot be in a situation where more and more businesses are shutting down, because of costs that are absolutely outside of their control,"" she added.
""We are not just talking about big businesses, we are talking more and more and more SMEs which are the lifeblood of our economy. 
""They need more support now as they did during Covid, this for us is no different. All we have had so far, publicly, are many words and not an action plan. Now we need an action plan, we need a plan and we need it delivered next week.""
Pressure is growing on the new prime minister to act quickly on the rising cost of living, with inflation, the rate at which prices rise, at 10.1%. 
Wholesale gas prices have been increasing since last year but have worsened recently because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin's decision to squeeze energy supplies to Europe. 
Small businesses across a number of industries have voiced their concerns over rising energy bills.
government has previously said no new policies will be announced until the new prime minister, either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak, is announced on Monday.
Restaurants will just close until spring - Tom Kerridge
On Thursday, chef Tom Kerridge told the BBC he had been quoted £35,000 a month by his electricity supplier at one of his restaurants. The business currently pays £5,000 per month.
He said many people in hospitality were considering ""mothballing"" their businesses, which means closing through the winter because they cannot afford to remain open.
""The numbers are so ridiculous and ludicrous that no wonder so many businesses are closing, [or] talking of closing,"" he added. 
Bank of England has forecast that the UK economy will fall into recession later this year, whereas the BCC has predicted a bleaker picture and a recession hitting sooner, with negative economic growth in three consecutive quarters before the end of 2022. 
Baroness Ruby said she did not believe government support would prevent a recession, but added the measures would help reduce the impacts of a shrinking economy.
A Treasury spokesman told the BBC preparations were being made on various ""options"" for the next prime minister to make firm police decisions on.
""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices, and while we can't shield everyone from the global challenges we face, we're supporting British businesses to navigate the months ahead,"" he said.
""We've cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance and slashing fuel duty. We've also introduced a 50% business rates relief for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses and put the brakes on bill increases by freezing the business rates multiplier, worth £4.6bn over the next five years."""	/news/business-62764121
sports	The teenage Scot surfing the world's big waves	"A new film charts the rise of young Scottish surfer Ben Larg, who is earning a reputation for tackling some of the world's biggest waves.
""I think the first time I ever surfed I must have been about two years old, on the front of my Dad's surfboard,"" says the 17-year-old from the Isle of Tiree.
From his early ventures into the surf as a toddler, Ben has gone on to compete for Scotland at European and world championships.
When he was 14 he become the youngest person to surf the 9m (30ft) waves that crash into the coast at Mallaghmore in south west Ireland.
Ben later went on to ride another monster of between 18m (60ft) and 21m (70ft) off Nazaré in Portugal, where enormous waves have been generated in the past by severe Atlantic storms that battered Scotland. 
Ben, whose parents Marti and Iona are often among his spectators, admits to fighting nerves as he prepares to ride giant waves - some as wide and tall as three double decker buses parked in a row.
""When you're out the back and you're super, super nervous and you're paddling on to one of those waves there's so many things going through your head,"" he says. 
""But as soon as you stand up it all clears and you are just focused on trying to survive.
""I don't know how fast you're going down one of those waves, but it must be like 40mph.""
New film Ride the Wave was three years in the making and charts Ben's exploits from the ages of 12 to 14. 
It is a debut feature documentary from Bafta-winning director and producer Martyn Robertson, and will be released in UK cinemas from 9 September. 
Martyn, who grew up with Ben's father in Fife, says: ""In the film we pick up Ben's story when he is 12 and just been crowned the under-18 Scottish surfing champion.
""The film follows Ben and his father initially going around the world to different competitions, trying to become a champion surfer.
""For various different reasons that play out in the film, Ben decides to change direction and instead of competing takes on a massive cold water wave in the south west coast of Ireland.""
Martyn adds: ""I suppose I wanted the film to observe a young boy being propelled to adulthood in a really explosive way."""	/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-62677222
technology	Molly Russell inquest: Online life was 'the bleakest of worlds'	"father of a 14-year-old who took her own life has told her inquest he was shocked that such ""dark, graphic, harmful material"" was readily available to be seen by children online.
Molly Russell, from Harrow in north-west London, died in November 2017 after seeing content about suicide and self harm.
Ian Russell told North London Coroner's Court he looked at some of his daughter's web history after her death.
He called it ""the bleakest of worlds"".
Mr Russell told the inquest much of the content seemed to ""normalise"" self-harm and suicide and discouraged people to get help with mental health. 
He said relentless images and videos promoted the idea that the world was dark and hopeless. 
""I also looked briefly at Molly's YouTube account and saw a… pattern - many normal teenage 'likes' and 'follows', but a similar high number of disturbing posts concerning anxiety, depression, self harm and suicide.
""On the family computer I saw that Molly continued to receive emails after her death from another social media platform, Pinterest.
""I was shocked to see the subject lines of the emails clearly promoting depressing content.""
Mr Russell earlier told North London Coroner's Court that he hoped Molly's death would remind people that it was ""OK not to be OK"" and to seek help.
He said the family noticed her change during the last year of her life, as she became more withdrawn.
""I knew Molly had an Instagram account and a Twitter account as I also had accounts on these platforms and we 'followed' each other, as did other members of the family.
""Molly closed the Twitter account of hers that we were all following and it was only after her death that I found out she had opened another account on Twitter.""
Mr Russell told the inquest: ""Just as Molly would have wanted, it is important to seek to learn whatever we can and then to take all necessary action to prevent such a young life being wasted again.""
A statement read out to the court on behalf of Molly's mother Janet outlined what happened when she discovered her daughter's body.
Mrs Russell said on the morning of her daughter's death, she was doing household chores and said goodbye to one of her other daughters who was leaving for school, before she began looking around the house for Molly, but could not find her.
Her statement said: ""I knew then something wasn't right. I saw a load of her clothes on the floor (of her bedroom). For some reason I thought Molly had run away.
""As I looked in her room, I found her… I had no doubt it was her.""
In a witness statement read to the court on behalf of retired Metropolitan Police detective Michael Walker, the coroner was told Molly watched videos uploaded by an American social media influencer who spoke about ""suicide and depression on a regular basis"".
urt was told the youngster had also followed a Twitter account which ""displays depressing quotes"".
unt has since been suspended.
Mr Russell said: ""Five years ago, Molly's feelings of worthlessness grew and her sense of helplessness deepened, and ending her life seemed to her like a solution - while to us her life seemed very normal.
""It's all too easy to forget the person she really was: someone full of love and hope and happiness, a young person full of promise and opportunity and potential.
""And so, as this inquest starts, we, her family, think it is essential to remember who Molly really was so we can each hold a picture in our minds of a caring individual, full of love and bubbling with excitement for what should have lay ahead in her life.""
Senior employees from Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, and Pinterest, are due to give evidence in person at Molly's inquest.
quest, which is expected to last for two weeks, will examine the algorithms used by social media to channel content to users.

business	Stansted Airport accepts council's £2.1m legal costs offer	"London Stansted Airport has accepted a council's ""all in"" offer of £2.1m to cover its legal costs following a High Court battle over expansion. 
rport won an appeal against Uttlesford District Council (UDC) in 2021, allowing it to increase capacity to 43 million passengers per year.
uncil was ordered to cover the airport's legal costs after an appeal and voted to offer £1.4m in June 2022. 
But this was rejected by the Essex airport in June. 
Earlier this month, the council voted to make two new offers of £2.05m, including £50,000 interest, and a second ""all in"" offer of £2.1m.
According to a council report published ahead of that meeting, £1m had already been paid to the airport in June, and this was included in the £2.1m figure.
was expected to wipe out the council's strategic initiative fund, which had a balance of £1.65m before the £1m was paid.
report said the medium term financial strategy will be used to cover the remaining £437,000.
In a statement, the airport said: ""We can confirm we have accepted UDC's offer in relation to our planning appeal costs, which it was ordered to pay by the Planning Inspectorate.""
At a meeting earlier this month, councillors from local authority's ruling Residents for Uttlesford (RfU) party said the airport had asked for a far larger figure, but that this had been negotiated down.
Stansted Airport said ""we welcome this positive step forward"" by the council.
ffer, which included £50,000 in interest, was voted through by councillors, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
RfU previously said the group hoped the offer would bring an end to the saga for the council.
Opposition councillors had criticised the administration over the legal case.

sports	Non Stanford: Former World champion 'will give her all' in final professional race	"Former World Triathlon champion Non Stanford will have ""mixed emotions"" during her final professional race.
33-year-old competes in Super League Triathlon's 2022 Championship Series Grand Finale in Saudi Arabia.
Stanford said ""reality had not set in"" that she would be competing for the last time on Saturday.
""On one hand I'm quite sad and some of the messages I've received have been quite tear inducing and really touching,"" she said.
""They've helped me reflect on the career I've had.
""Although this is my decision and I'm ready for the next step it seems really strange that it is going to be my last race.
""But on the flip side I'm really excited about the future.""
Bridgend-born and raised in Swansea, Stanford was a promising young track and cross country athlete before switching to triathlon.
She was 2012 ITU Under-23 World Champion before becoming senior World champion a year later.
""Now and again I've sat down and thought about my career as a whole and what I've been lucky enough to do, the places that I've been and the competitions I've been to ,"" Stanford told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
""I have a little bit of an appreciation but I don't think it's really going to sink in until the months that follow.
""I've had a really busy few months because I started work with British Triathlon at the start of October, so the last month has been absolutely hectic and I've barely had time to sit down.
""I've also got my wedding next month so I think probably in the New Year when the wedding and honeymoon is done and life settles down and I get more into a normal routine I will reflect on it.
""When you're an athlete you never take that time and you're always looking at the next event, the next race.""
Stanford's final season of competition saw her win gold at the European Championships in Munich in August, her final major international competition.
was preceded at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, when she won silver for Wales in the mixed triathlon relay.
""It's always been a lifelong dream to stand on a podium and see the Welsh flag flying and to finally fulfil that in Birmingham this year was really special.
""It was really special to do that as part of a team in such an individual sport. But on this one occasion to stand there with three other members of the Welsh team and experience that moment was really special.
""It's definitely something that will always stand out when I think about my career.""
In Saturday's final race in Neom, Stanford - who has taken up a role as assistant coach with British Triathlon - returns after recovering from a calf injury.
""I'm trying to not get too emotional beforehand and I can stand on the start line as calm as possible,"" Stanford said.
""I have no expectations going into the race. I haven't actually run in the last five weeks because of my calf and this will be my first run for quite a while.
""I will stand there with a smile, soak it all up and enjoy it and give it my all one last time.""

health	Superbug fight 'needs farmers to reduce antibiotic use'	"Health and animal welfare campaigners concerned about the spread of superbugs in humans are calling for a ban on the overuse of antibiotics in farm animals.
routinely using antibiotics in livestock can lead to bacteria becoming resistant and such 'superbugs' could spread to humans.
Sample tests they carried out in rivers near farms, in slurry and in chicken litter found resistant bacteria.
government said it is considering new restrictions on antibiotic use.
A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said: ""We do not support routine preventative use of antibiotics in animals - they should not compensate for poor husbandry practices and we will continue to look into strengthening legislation in this area.""
National Farmers Union said UK farming was ""a leader when it comes to the responsible use of antibiotics"". 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been described by the World Health Organisation as ""one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.""
ruse of antibiotics, in both human medicine and agriculture, has seen them become less effective and led to the rise of 'superbugs' - strains of bacteria that can no longer be treated by certain drugs.
ublished by the UK Health Security Agency shows that the estimated total number of serious antibiotic resistant infections in England rose by 2.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, from 52,842 to 53,985.
Researchers for the Alliance to Save our Antibiotics and World Animal Protection carried out tests for superbugs in rivers alongside a dozen intensive and higher-welfare pig and poultry farms in Warwickshire, Herefordshire, Devon, Norfolk and the Wye Valley and in the slurry from four intensive dairy farms and in one chicken litter sample.
found a range of antibiotic-resistant genes and resistant strains of bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).
gher levels of at least one type of resistance were found downstream of five of out eight intensive farms. None of the four higher welfare outdoor pig or chicken farms tested had higher levels of any type of resistance downstream than was found upstream, according to the report.
""Overall, our findings suggest that factory farms are likely to be discharging resistance genes and superbugs into public waterways,"" concluded the report, which was drawn up with Fera Science and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.
Intensive 'factory' farming methods have been blamed for contributing to the rise in AMR, with claims that a high number of animals kept closely together can be a breeding ground for disease and can lead to antibiotics being given to whole herds or flocks simply to keep illness at bay.
Cóilín Nunan, scientific adviser to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, said that higher-welfare farming methods were needed to keep the risk of illness and antibiotic use down.
""Most antibiotics taken by people or animals are excreted, along with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. When manure or slurry is spread on land, this increases the number of resistant bacteria in soils and water,"" he said.
""The best way to reduce farming's impact is to make large cuts to antibiotic use, and this means keeping animals in healthier conditions so they rarely need medication."" 
Professor Isabelle Durance, director of the Cardiff Water Research Institute, who was not involved in the study, told the BBC it was accepted that faecal matter entering water bodies can carry with it drug-resistant bacteria and genes, and that could come from farming.
""We know that with faecal material from agricultural production, there is an amount that enters wastewater. You can have perfectly healthy chickens with bacteria that have antimicrobial resistance. As soon as there is faecal material in water bodies there will be anti-microbial resistant bacteria,"" she explained.
But she warned it was ""extremely difficult"" to link the bacteria in rivers to a specific source.
Peter Greig, the co-founder of Pipers Farm, oversees 45 higher-welfare outdoor farms across Somerset, Devon, Cornwall, Wales and East Anglia which, he says, only use antibiotics when sick animals are in need and not as a routine preventative measure.
Mr Greig said he was not surprised by the report's findings: ""It's a no-brainer. The excreta which comes out of an industrial pig or poultry environment is then spread so that it feeds into the groundwater and into the rivers. That causes a major disruption to the balance of nature.""
In January, the EU banned all routine farm antibiotic use and all preventative antibiotic treatments of groups of animals in order to tackle the overuse, and inappropriate use, of the medicines.
government had supported a ban in 2018 but has yet to carry out the public consultation it said it would.
Defra said proposed changes to existing regulations on antibiotic use on farms would be put out for public consultation ""in due course"". 
Meanwhile, the latest annual UK Veterinary Antibiotic Resistance and Sales Surveillance (UK-VARSS) report, published earlier this month, showed sales of antibiotics for use in livestock had reduced by 55% since 2014.
Cat McLaughlin, of The Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture (RUMA) Alliance, said livestock farmers were continuing to ""make positive progress on antibiotic use reduction targets"". 
But she added: ""We must remember that antibiotics are important tools that the veterinary sector needs at its disposal to protect animal health and welfare against disease challenges.'"	/news/science-environment-63666024
sports	Aaliyah Powell: Overcoming taekwondo ‘fear’ and rivalling Jade Jones	"""When I first started taekwondo I hated sparring and I was really scared!""
Aaliyah Powell wanted nothing to do with the combat side of her sport as a 10-year-old. 
Fast-forward almost a decade and she has not only become a junior world champion, but also broke Jade Jones' record as Britain's youngest-ever senior world medallist.
19-year-old is now the double Olympic champion's biggest rival for a place at Paris 2024.
Powell's rise is all the more impressive given she sustained a serious knee ligament injury that threatened to derail her career.
On Sunday, Powell aims to remind rivals of her prowess when she goes head-to-head with her ""idol"" in the same -57kg division at the European Championships in Manchester.
""Europeans will be exciting, especially with us both being in the same category,"" she tells BBC Sport. ""I'm pushing to achieve the same goal as her, which is gold in Paris.""
Powell laughs when reflecting on the ""fear"" she experienced when first stepping on to the mat. Back then, the girl from Huddersfield had other dreams.
""I originally thought fencing looked fun, but I was too young and after watching my cousin do a taekwondo taster session, I followed her,"" she says.
""I said I'd do it for one or two years until I was old enough to drop it for fencing, but I've been doing it ever since.""
She initially ""fell in love"" with the more traditional form of the martial art - the Poomsea discipline - which sees players assessed on their ability to perform sets of movements, such as kicks, blocks and punches in a 'meaningful order' in response to imaginary attacks.
""My coach would have to stand behind me and force me to fight people otherwise I'd run away,"" she recalls. 
""As I got older the tactical elements hooked me though, and once I got over the fear of fighting, I progressed very quickly.""
Powell began to realise she could have a career in the sport after winning her maiden international title - Dutch Open cadet gold - in 2016.
Euro Youth silver (2017) and World Junior gold (2018) followed before a 'shock' senior British team call-up for the 2019 World Championships in Manchester.
""I was still a junior athlete, I wasn't full-time and my dad just put the application in on a whim on the last day it could be submitted,"" she recalls.
""I didn't think I'd get the pick and when I did, I was shocked and didn't want to do it.
""In fact, I said 'I'm not doing it!' because when you're a junior taking on seniors it is really daunting and I was scared.""
Powell was eventually convinced to compete and despite the event taking place during her GCSE exams the then 16-year-old stunned the home crowd - and taekwondo community - by securing what she describes as an ""overwhelming"" -53kg bronze.
She soon became a full-time member of the senior GB Taekwondo programme, joining the likes of Jones as well as fellow Olympic medallists Bianca Walkden and Lauren Williams.
Dreams of immediate sustained senior success were soon dashed, though, after partially tearing knee ligaments, before a complete rupture of her meniscus in late 2019.
""I cried a lot at the beginning,"" admits Powell, who feared for her future in the sport.
""I had to have a couple of surgeries and on top of that there was Covid and lockdown, which stopped me training and halted my progress for sure, but it's given me a lot of mental resilience which will hopefully help me in my career.""
fighter says she has drawn ""confidence"" from speaking with team-mate Walkden, who returned from three potentially career-ending knee injuries before claiming the first of her three world titles.
Since her own comeback, Powell has claimed bronze at the World Taekwondo Women's Championship and silver at the Swedish Open last month - losing 9-5 to Jones in the final.
""We're the same weight, only one of us can go [to the Olympics]. I'm looking to achieve it for the first time and obviously she's been really successful for a long time,"" says Powell.
""It's hard for both of us,"" she continues, ""but I think we both really push one another and make each other better.""
2022 Europeans - which run from 19-22 May - are the first major event of the Paris 2024 qualification cycle and Powell has only one target as she begins the race for GB's sole Olympic -57kg berth.
""Gold is what I'm going for,"" she states. ""It's what I want and for me it would just show the hard work, sacrifice and perseverance to push through the injury was worth it."""	/sport/taekwondo/61479663

business	Pace of UK house price rises slows to 11-month low, says ONS	"UK house prices rose at the slowest rate for 11 months, according to official figures, but property values were still up 7.8% in the year to June.
ual increase in the UK average house price slowed from 12.8% the previous month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
It reflects sharp rises in demand and prices a year ago, just ahead of the withdrawal of a stamp duty tax break.
Scotland recorded the biggest rise in house prices in the latest figures.
Property prices were up by 11.6%, compared with a 7.3% rise in England, an 8.6% increase in Wales, and a 9.6% rise in Northern Ireland.
Among the English regions, the East recorded the fastest rise (up 9.7%) with the slowest in the North East (up 3.6%).
In the rental sector, the ONS said that prices paid by tenants accelerated by 3.2% in the 12 months to July - the largest annual growth since January 2016.
rising cost of living and higher interest rates - leading to more expensive mortgages - will have an effect on the housing market. However, the ongoing mismatch between the number of homes on the market and the number of potential buyers is keeping prices relatively high.
rage UK home cost £286,000 in June, which is £20,000 higher than a year earlier, the ONS said.
Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Right now, price rises are being driven by an imbalance of supply and demand, and a shortage of property for sale. 
""However, with buyer numbers slowly falling and seller numbers rising, this will shift. Buyers are also starting to lose confidence, which is key.""
rising cost of living was not the most significant factor in the slowdown in house price rises in June.
Instead, it was the state of the market a year earlier as buyers raced to complete to take advantage of the stamp duty discounts in England and Northern Ireland.

technology	Mario Kart: Next game could be 'victim of current title's success'	"most successful racing video game franchise of all time started with a simple concept.
In 1992, Nintendo released Super Mario Kart on their Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) console.
game was produced by Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and followed the release of F-Zero - a well-received debut on the console for another popular racing series - but as a single-player experience, the company wanted to take things further.
ment team set out to create a two-player racing game which displayed both players on the same game screen simultaneously. But due to the limitations of the SNES, it wouldn't have been possible to illustrate the futuristic high speeds of F-Zero, so it needed to slow things down a bit. 
As a result, they decided to go with karts. However, it wasn't originally planned to feature Mario, Princess Peach and friends. 
A few months into development, when they had a prototype of two karts featuring generic racers of guys in overalls, they decided to see how Mario would look in the game. According to Miyamoto, everyone agreed it looked better with the inclusion of their famous mascot and so, the Mario Kart series was born.
Industry analyst Serkan Toto of Kantan Games describes the title as a ""system seller"" for the SNES.
""Already back then, Nintendo was leveraging the Mario brand,"" he tells the BBC. ""So they put Mario in there to sell more copies of the game than with, for example, a new character that they would have to come up with.
""It actually made a lot of sense to put characters of the Mario universe into that racing game.""
wer-ups - which are now synonymous with the series - were there, including the ability to throw shells and bananas to hamper opponents as well as collect coins to boost speed. 
It also included battle mode where players attempt to try and pop their opponent's balloons in more open environments, which remains a popular part of the series. 
rty years later, the fun of playing with friends and family remains a huge part of Mario Kart's charm. 
Following the initial game, Nintendo has gone on to release at least one new title for almost all of their subsequent consoles, along with various spin-off titles including a mobile game.
In total, nearly 168 million copies have been sold worldwide and it remains the most popular Mario spin-off game series.
""I think that as far as racing games go, in terms of sales, status or impact on the genre, it's difficult to think of a more influential one than this,"" says Toto.
game's popularity has resulted in the creation of various similar concepts by other developers such as Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and Crash Team Racing to name a few. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Nintendo Switch is the latest release in the main series, and, in February 2022, a paid ""Booster Course Pass"" was announced for the game. The download pack (known in the industry as downloadable content, or DLC) will eventually bring a total of 48 more courses, in six instalments. The new racetracks will include classics from series' history, alongside various new tracks. 
With the release doubling the number of circuits available, much of the gaming community felt it was good value for money and welcomed the update. However, some were left disappointed about the lack of a new entry in the main franchise, five years after the release of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
Furthermore, when the first batch of DLC courses dropped, not all players were happy. 
Some complained that the additional circuits lacked the quality of the game's original content, while it's also been claimed that too many of the new courses are ported from the Mario Kart Tour mobile app, bringing that game's art style with them. 
Eurogamer's Oliver Mackenzie said as part of his in-depth look: ""The best MK8 tracks combine challenging sets of fast corners with extended anti-gravity sections, multiple viable routes, and track hazards.
""Most of the new tracks are sedate in comparison, with laid-back layouts, less interesting track features, and little in the way of vehicle transformations.
""Simply porting mobile tracks over without major modifications means they don't match the gameplay concepts in Mario Kart 8 especially well.""
Following the recent release of the second wave, in the conclusion of his review, Ollie Reynolds from Nintendo Life said: ""Ultimately, Wave 2 Of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe doesn't quite knock it out of the park. 
""We know we've been bashing these courses left, right, and centre, but when it comes to Mario Kart, we have pretty high standards, you know. However, none of the tracks on offer are straight-up bad; most of them just feel like 'b-side' filler when compared to the main tracks created specifically for Mario Kart 8.""
""We have to keep reminding ourselves of the bigger picture, too; we've now got 16 new courses for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and we're not even halfway through yet. We've still got a ways to go.""
With new courses releasing periodically until the end of 2023, a sequel to the bestselling game in the series so far before then is unlikely.
Nintendo declined to comment on this article.
WATCH: Mixed-reality Mario Karts race around the home
Other than Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, an augmented reality game where a radio-controlled toy car races around the player's house while streaming video from the onboard cameras directly into the video game, there hasn't been an original release title since 2014 - with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe essentially an enhanced Nintendo Switch update of the original Mario Kart 8 title on the Wii U. 
Another highly successful game, Grand Theft Auto Five, didn't get an official sequel throughout the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One era, essentially skipping a generation and it looks as though Nintendo might do the same with the Switch and Mario Kart 8. 
However, both developers will feel as though their games have received sufficient improvements to keep them fresh. Mario Kart 8's initial upgrade to Deluxe featured various additions, including a further five playable characters and now the subsequent DLC release.
With both GTA 5 and Mario Kart 8 in the top 10 best-selling video games of all time and a GTA 5 release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X earlier this year, they continue to generate a significant amount of revenue - so perhaps it's no surprise that neither Rockstar nor Nintendo have been in a rush to release sequels.  
In terms of an eventual follow-up to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Toto predicts gamers may have to wait until the release of the Switch's successor. 
""It's hard to say but if I had to, I think there would be some distance to Mario Kart 8, maybe 2024, something like that,"" he says.
""But I think, if Mario Kart 9 comes out with a new Switch console, I think they will launch it as a launch title, or very close to launch."" 
However, any new game in such a popular series will look to bring fresh ideas to the table - something Nintendo have been able to do so far, but Toto feels one of their biggest challenges is to keep delivering moving forward.
""Mario Kart 8 is so well made, that it might even be a victim of its own success,"" he explains.
""I heard that apparently, Nintendo came up with a new idea for Mario Kart 9. I think that they need a little bit of a reboot for Mario Kart 9. I'm not saying that Nintendo is rebooting the series, but what I'm trying to say is, I think they need a new angle for the series.""
""I think that Mario Kart 9 actually has to offer something new because just a rehash of Mario Kart 8 is probably not going to cut it for Nintendo."""	/news/entertainment-arts-62362647
sports	Manchester City: Pep Guardiola vows to quit if he needs to despite contract extension	"Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says he will quit if he feels something about the club is ""broken"".
Guardiola signed a two-year contract extension with City last month that will take him to 2025.
If he fulfils the deal, it would take his overall tenure to nine years.
However, Guardiola said at a news conference on Friday: ""The moment I feel something is broken, I will resign or not extend.""
Guardiola was only slightly younger when he joined City than Sir Alex Ferguson was when he quit Aberdeen for Manchester United in 1986, and younger than Arsene Wenger was when he left Japan for Arsenal a decade later, but has ruled out replicating the lengthy tenures both men went on to enjoy at those clubs.
""I continue to say I'm not going to stay like Fergie and Arsene,"" Guardiola said. ""The contract is just paper. I extended because I have the feeling we can still play good. But in the end, it's the results. If we are tired of each other, I will not finish this contract.""
Ferguson made an art form out of regenerating his squad, dumping experienced crowd favourites to ensure there was a steady stream of talent coming through the system to keep his longer serving players hungry.
Guardiola points to teenage defender Rico Lewis as an example of his attempt to achieve something similar after an impressive run of four Premier League titles in five seasons.
And while Arsenal enjoy a five-point lead at the top of the table, Guardiola still believes in his players to make a concerted effort at becoming only the sixth side to complete a hat-trick of title successes.
""It's complicated,"" he said. ""When you win a lot, it is easier to handle situations. But on the other side it is 'oh, we have to do it again'. 
""Arsenal have done brilliantly and better than us so far. For a long time they have not been there and they want to continue being there.
""But I see the desire from the way we played at Leeds, after the other contenders all won. 
""We are close [to Arsenal]. It is not 15 or 20 points. I would prefer to be closer but it is not a big distance."""	/sport/football/64130479
politics	Scottish budget likely to target higher earners	"Scottish government is expected to target the country's higher earners when it unveils its tax and spending plans for next year.
Finance Secretary John Swinney said his budget would include ""decisive action"" to tackle the cost of living crisis.
kely to include cutting the threshold at which people start paying the top 46p rate of income tax from its current level of £150,000.
re has been speculation that middle earners may also need to pay more. 
Income tax rates in Scotland, as well as several other taxes, are set by the Scottish government rather than by UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt. 
BBC Scotland political editor Glenn Campbell said the government knows it will be criticised whatever it decides to do on taxation, with the SNP's manifesto at the last Holyrood election promising not to raise income tax rates or bands during this parliamentary term.
But he said he believed the government would take the view that the political and financial pain would be greater if it did not increase the amount of money it raises from taxation. 
He added: ""I would expect for a start that he will lower the threshold for the top rate of income tax in Scotland - as the UK government has already done.
""I wouldn't be surprised if he goes much further on tax. I think tax is the key to this budget.""
Mr Hunt announced last month that the UK government would cut the threshold at which people start paying the top rate of tax in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to £125,000, and Mr Swinney is expected to at least match that.
re have been newspaper reports that the government is also considering raising the 41p and 46p tax rates.
Scottish government has frozen the threshold for the 41p higher rate in recent years - it currently begins at £43,663 in Scotland, compared to £50,271 elsewhere in the UK - and could continue to do so.
However, it is much less likely to increase the rate that is paid by lower earners, which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously said would be counterproductive in a cost of living crisis. 
Mr Swinney said the government would use its taxation powers to the ""maximum extent that is responsible"" and has warned that ""difficult decisions"" will need to be made on funding for public services.
Many departments are expected to be see real-terms cuts as the government continues to grapple with high inflation and interest rates and the cost of economic support measures.
uty first minister - who is standing in as finance secretary while Kate Forbes is on maternity leave - is expected to begin his budget speech at around 14:25.
He has said his plans would help create a ""fairer, more equal Scotland"" and will help address inequality, create wealth and opportunity and make sure public services remain sustainable.
However he has also warned that the country was still facing ""sustained economic pressure"" on public finances.
When rising prices, higher than expected pay deals and Ukrainian refugee support ate into the Scottish budget this year, ministers made cuts elsewhere to balance the books. 
fference now, as they look ahead to another tough year for the public finances, is that they can choose to use devolved tax powers to increase the cash they have to spend. 
re is a clamour for them to do so from the trade union movement and others, while the Conservatives and key business voices are cautioning against putting up tax. 
Ministers know they'll be criticised whatever they decide but from my conversations at Holyrood, I think the considered view is that the political and financial pain would be greater if they did not act. 
While the SNP has a manifesto commitment to avoid increasing income tax rates during this parliament, they left themselves a bit of wriggle room in the small print. 
In any event, they can still increase the tax paid by higher earners by freezing or lowering the thresholds at which the higher and top rates of tax take effect.
In the previous budget, Ms Forbes gave councils free reign to set local tax rates at whatever level they choose, and this is expected to continue next year.
government has also faced calls from firms to freeze the poundage rate of business tax, with the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland saying firms need to be given ""room to breathe and space to grow"".
Mr Swinney has said he will prioritise tackling child poverty in his spending plans, as well as moving to a ""net zero"" economy in terms of carbon emissions, and supporting public services in a sustainable way.
He has also promised to begin a ""fundamental change in the way we manage public spending"", in a bid to make public services and finances ""more sustainable and resilient"".
Fraser of Allander Institute - an economic think tank based at the University of Strathclyde - has highlighted that extra funding from the UK Treasury should offset the impact of inflation over the next two financial years.
However much of that cash has already been ring-fenced for spending on health services, meaning other departments are still likely to face real-terms cuts.
Scottish government is also committed to controversial plans for setting up a new National Care Service, which is estimated to cost between £664m to £1.26bn over the next five years. 
And ministers will face questions about £20m which had been earmarked to deliver an independence referendum in the next financial year.
Supreme Court has since ruled that MSPs cannot set up a vote without Westminster's backing, but the government insists it is committed to offering Scots a choice on their future.
Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith told BBC Scotland that she expected too see tax rises given the ""very difficult fiscal circumstances"". 
She added: ""What I'm much more worried about is the differential between Scotland and the rest of the UK.
""It is absolutely essential that Scotland is an attractive place to work and live and invest, and if we see a widening of those differentials that affects that attractiveness.""
Scottish Labour called on the government to use its tax powers, as well as cutting internal spending on advisors and spin doctors in order to funnel more cash to households.
Finance spokesman Daniel Johnson said: ""The government will have to look at using its powers flexibly and to the maximum extent it can, and I can't say they always have in previous years.""
Liberal Democrats are calling for extra funding for insulation and energy efficiency, long Covid support and social care."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63970596
entertainment	Glass Onion: Daniel Craig's Knives Out sequel continues Whodunit craze	"question of what has prompted the recent resurgence in Whodunits is practically a Whodunit in itself. 
Is the US TV series Only Murders In The Building behind their sudden popularity? The Thursday Murder Club novels by Richard Osman? Kenneth Branagh's re-imagining of Hercule Poirot? Or do the continued sales of Agatha Christie novels show that Whodunits never left in the first place? 
g we can truly be sure of is it was not Colonel Mustard in the drawing room.
Whatever the cause, they are certainly big business at the moment. Netflix reportedly paid $450m (£376m) for the rights to two Knives Out sequels, the first of which, Glass Onion, is released on Friday.
riginal Knives Out movie starred Daniel Craig as detective Benoit Blanc, alongside Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ana de Armas in her breakout role. 
An old-fashioned yet innovative murder mystery, it was not the kind of landfill superhero movie or sci-fi blockbuster that has stormed the box office in recent years. And yet, that is exactly what it did - taking $313m (£255m).
Glass Onion, which stars an entirely new cast apart from Craig, is the first of what could be many sequels. Its writer and director, Rian Johnson, isn't surprised by the enduring popularity of Whodunits. 
""It makes sense to me, because it's the same thing that's always been appealing about the genre,"" he tells BBC News. ""What's not to love? You have a rogue's gallery of interesting characters, you have a central charismatic detective, you have intrigue, you have mystery, comedy, human drama, all the ingredients are there.
""And for me, I'm a Whodunit junkie, I'm in heaven right now, the fact that there are more and more of these things, and that talents like Steve Martin are writing mysteries right now, to me, that's heaven.""
Steve Martin project Johnson is referring to is Only Murders In The Building, which also stars Selena Gomez and Martin Short. The successful comedy-drama was recently renewed for a third season.
It follows three neighbours who become suspicious that a murder has been committed in their building. The trio of unlikely sleuths team up to host a true crime podcast and solve the mystery.
Another big-screen Whodunit released this year was See How They Run, starring Sam Rockwell and Saoirse Ronan in a standout comedic performance.
It flew somewhat under the radar because it was released in cinemas the day after the Queen died, but it's now available on Disney+.
""I think murder mysteries seem to wax and wane in cinema,"" the film's director Tom George tells BBC News. ""But in the UK specifically, they're pretty constant. A year probably doesn't go by where there isn't some new imagining of an Agatha Christie story.""
Set in London's West End in 1953, See How They Run follows a director's efforts to transfer the success of Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap from the West End to the big screen.
But everything goes wrong when a key member of the production team is murdered. It is a riot - a murder mystery within a murder mystery - and one of the season's most enjoyable films.
""I think the reason Whodunits keep audiences coming back to them as stories is the audience are trying to do the same thing that the detectives are trying to do - crack the case,"" suggests George.
""And that makes for a brilliant story. In any film you're trying to get the audience to connect with their lead character or characters as soon as possible by sort of putting them in their shoes. 
""So in a Whodunit, that's kind of baked in from the start. So from very early on, the audience are locked in with the detectives. They're watching each of the suspects and trying to figure out, what are their tells? What can I learn from this interaction? And it just makes for a really compelling story. 
""And there's something really reassuring about a puzzle where you know that all the pieces are eventually going to click into place - something you don't necessarily get in everyday life or true crime.""
As well as being portrayed as a character in See How They Run, Christie was also an inspiration for Knives Out. Johnson says the queen of the Whodunit was a particular influence on him as a child. 
""It's a genre I just dearly love and have a real passion for,"" he says. ""I thought about growing up watching the Agatha Christie adaptations with my family, and how they were some of my most treasured movie experiences.
""And I thought, I think there are people who are really going to want to see something like Knives Out. So we rolled the dice, but we really didn't know [it would be that successful].""
While worldwide book sales are always a nightmare to verify, Christie's own estate claims she is the best-selling novelist of all time, and is outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare.
Last month, it was announced that Christie's The Mousetrap will finally open on Broadway, having played in London's West End for 70 years (Covid lockdowns excepted).
""The love of a Whodunit is embedded in British DNA, and I think we can trace much of this to Agatha Christie,"" says The Mousetrap's producer Adam Spiegel, who will also co-produce the show on Broadway.
""Her remarkable body of work both remains enormously popular with the public, and she is a source of great inspiration for the new generation of writers.""
wo of Christie's most famous murder mysteries have been remade in recent years with Kenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot - Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile.
A stage adaptation of another Christie mystery, The Mirror Crack'd, is touring the UK, while two new TV series about the author fronted by Alan Carr and Lucy Worsley recently aired on Channel 4 and BBC Two respectively.
Whodunits are everywhere you look. The BBC's excellent reality series The Traitors saw 22 members of the public gathered in a Scottish castle, tasked with finding three traitors in their midst. It regularly topped the iPlayer chart.
Glass Onion's producer Ram Bergman suggests Knives Out has had a positive influence on the number of Whodunits being commissioned.
""People were afraid to make those,"" he says, ""and I think because Knives Out was so successful, it kind of gave the freedom for the studios and streamers, 'there's an audience for these movies, let's make more of those'. Before, I think they were nervous about it.""
gin with, Glass Onion feels somewhat disappointing after the brilliance of Knives Out. But once the set-up has been established, the film changes gear.
""Once the twists kick in, Glass Onion is edge-of-the-seat stuff,"" said the Evening Standard's Charlotte O'Sullivan. ""The year's most ingeniously entertaining movie,"" is how Metro's Larushka Ivan-Zadeh described it.
But Kevin Maher of the Times said it is ""a bad case of sequelitis"", adding: ""It's bigger, louder, emptier. The plot, which is the driving force of any murder mystery, is conspicuously flimsy, with very few surprises and little ingenuity.""
So, how do you write a truly great Whodunit?
""First and foremost you come up with a story,"" says Johnson. ""Who is the character we care about, what is their dilemma, and how are we going to have a satisfying ending? Not just in the Whodunit sense of 'oh that person did it', but a truly satisfying story.
""And you come up with that and then you have your spine, and you start layering things on, figuring things out, and planting things here and there. The mystery part is the fun part, the tough part is coming up with a movie that's going to keep people entertained for two hours.""  "	/news/entertainment-arts-62645614
sports	Southport rugby player's emotional return after leukaemia	"A teenager, who had not played rugby for three years while being treated for leukaemia, has said returning to the pitch was ""emotional"" as it was his ""light at the end of the tunnel"". 
Connor Ellerton, 17, from Southport, was diagnosed with cancer in 2019.
His comeback for Southport Colts was marked with a guard of honour and standing ovation from his teammates.
He said he had been ""desperate"" to put the kit on again and that ""lovely gesture"" made it ""very special"".
Connor has played at Southport Rugby Football Club since he was five, while also playing at school, and he has grown up with most of the squad.  
""Rugby has been in my life as long as I remember,"" he said. 
""I played almost every day and I was desperate to play again. It was my light at the end of the tunnel.""
Connor said being back in the changing room was ""amazing"" and then walking through the tunnel with a guard of honour by both his own team and opponents Sandbach U18 Colts was a ""lovely gesture"".
His mother, Joanne Dennett, said Connor was treated for ear infections in the months before he was diagnosed with the blood cancer. 
He had to undergo gruelling treatment but sailed through his GCSEs - passing nine with grades A and B.
However, Ms Dennett said not being able to play rugby was tough for Connor, although he did still attend games. 
""He found missing rugby the hardest thing,"" she said, adding that he just wanted to get back to playing with his friends.
Now he is in remission, Ms Dennett said she did not expect the club to ""make such a fuss"" of Connor but they had always been supportive.
""The club is like family. They always go above and beyond.
""It was amazing - a lovely surprise.""
ff his comeback, Connor was awarded man of the match as his side beat Sandbach in the North West Colts League 26-19. 
""Winning the game made it even better,"" he said.

entertainment	English National Opera fights 'absurd' plan to relocate to Manchester	"English National Opera's boss has dismissed a plan to move out of London and slash its funding as ""not doable"".
On Friday, Arts Council England said it would axe the company's entire £12.6m annual grant from 2023, instead giving it £17m over three years - but only if it relocates, possibly to Manchester.
On Wednesday, the ENO's Stuart Murphy said: ""I think we're going to be saying to the secretary of state tomorrow and to the Arts Council, 'We can definitely do levelling up, but that can only happen with a big London base.'""
He described the Arts Council's plan - which he only learned about a day before the announcement - as ""absurd"" and ""insane"".
restigious company is now campaigning for the decision to be reversed, and is supporting a petition set up by opera singer Sir Bryn Terfel, which has more than 16,000 signatures.
Mr Murphy said he initially thought a move could be viable. ""We then looked at the money over the weekend,"" he told BBC News.
""We spoke to people that the Arts Council hadn't bothered to speak to in Manchester, from across the opera world, and our staff - and it's just not doable.""
One reason is because opera employs people with specialist skills, both on stage and behind the scenes, he said.
""These are skills that can't just be learned in the three years we've been given. These are people who've been in the company for 40 years. It takes a long time to train to be an opera singer. We can't just close down in one area and start in another.""
Also, opera ""requires fundraising on a pretty big scale"", and Manchester has fewer sources of money - some of which have already been tapped by Opera North, which currently tours to Salford.
""So straight away you've got a situation which is really hard, to pull up the really deep roots of an opera company and just transport it,"" Mr Murphy said.
He claimed the Arts Council had not sounded out Leeds-based Opera North, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, or the new home he said ACE had earmarked for the ENO - Manchester's £210m new arts venue, Factory International.
""This came as a complete surprise to them. It came as a massive surprise to us because our report card from the Arts Council says we're doing an amazing job,"" Mr Murphy said.
""It reminds us that one in seven of our audience are under 35, that a fifth of our singers are ethnically diverse, that our average ticket price is a quarter of that of a normal opera house and we give free tickets to under-21s.
""And we do these amazing things like ENO Breathe with the NHS that happen right across the country. So we've kind of done everything that was asked of us and more, even by the Arts Council's admission.
""So to just put in place a funding suggestion, which is half our funding level, 200 miles away, to happen in 20 weeks, is absurd.""
Mr Murphy, who recently announced his departure as ENO chief executive, called on the Arts Council to carry out a strategic review of opera provision across the country.
He warned: ""If they're not careful, they're going to dismantle an arts organisation that's been in existence for almost 100 years and is seen as a beacon for progressive work that's broken down preconceptions of opera.""
ENO is based at the London Coliseum in the West End and is one of two major opera companies in the capital, along with the Royal Opera.
grant delivered by the Arts Council, using government money, accounts for around a third of its annual income.
mpany took the headlines in a wider redistribution of arts funding after the Arts Council was told by the government to move millions of pounds outside the capital.
Arts Council has said the ENO will not receive any funding after April 2023 if it does not relocate.
A spokesperson said: ""We require English National Opera to relocate the core of their work to another part of England if they wish to continue to receive regular public funding from us.
""We raised Manchester as an option and English National Opera initially received that idea positively. English National Opera's future is in their hands - at this early stage we have announced our funding plans for the next three years, and now we hope to engage in detailed planning with them.
""This would involve English National Opera reshaping their business model and finding a suitable location outside of London.""
ENO's bosses could face the decision of whether to move out of London and keep some public funding, or stay in the capital as a privately-funded operation.
""There definitely could be a private opera house in London. There's lots in the south-east already,"" said Mr Murphy, adding that the ticket prices would inevitably increase.
""Straight away you're talking £300-350 for your most expensive ticket. That is not what brings on new work, brings on talent, brings on the next generation.
""It over-caters to the same rich metropolitan middle class audience, and that's why opera is dying as an artform.""
Manchester's Factory International said it had not been contacted by the ENO, and that the Arts Council had not suggested the ENO would move into its new building. 
A spokeswoman said: ""We would of course be enthusiastic to collaborate with ENO on appropriate projects that fitted both organisations' goals - which in our case would be on new works, not the traditional opera repertoire."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63572094

A coalition of trade unions and community organisations are taking part in the demonstration, which was organised by the People's Assembly.
group has called for a general election, action on low pay and the repeal of ""anti-union"" employment laws.
Protesters marched from Embankment to Trafalgar Square, where a rally is being held with various speakers.
Metropolitan Police said: ""There are currently a number of different demonstrations across London this afternoon.
""Several protests groups as expected are present in Trafalgar Square, with stewards on the ground working with police.""
force previously said extra officers would be on the streets as it expected demonstrations by environmental campaign group Just Stop Oil.
Speaking at the rally, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government would be ""forced to listen"" to protesters calling for improved pay and workers rights.
""Governments do eventually listen because of popular movements,"" he said.
""The people out here are very determined.""
Michelle Uden, from south-east London, took her seven-year-old twin boys to the demonstration and said she wanted a change in leadership after struggling with the cost of living.
34-year-old cares for her husband, who has epilepsy, she said: ""Enough is enough.
""If we don't stand up and fight we'll sit down and cry.""
Mrs Uden said she took her children to the protest as she wanted them to see ""democracy in action"".
Ramona McCartney, national organiser for the People's Assembly, said: ""The government is in a deep crisis and the third prime minister in a matter of months has been decided by a tiny elite.
""We want to make this the biggest demonstration possible to force them to a general election and in solidarity with every striking worker.""

technology	AI tools fail to reduce recruitment bias - study	"Artificially intelligent hiring tools do not reduce bias or improve diversity, researchers say in a study.
""There is growing interest in new ways of solving problems such as interview bias,"" the Cambridge University researchers say, in the journal Philosophy and Technology
use of AI is becoming widespread - but its analysis of candidate videos or applications is ""pseudoscience"". 
A professional body for human resources told BBC News AI could counter bias.
In 2020, the study notes, an international survey of 500 human-resources professionals suggested nearly a quarter were using AI for ""talent acquisition, in the form of automation"".
But using it to reduce bias is counter-productive and, University of Cambridge's Centre for Gender Studies post-doctoral researcher Dr Kerry Mackereth told BBC News, based on ""a myth"".
""These tools can't be trained to only identify job-related characteristics and strip out gender and race from the hiring process, because the kinds of attributes we think are essential for being a good employee are inherently bound up with gender and race,"" she said.
Some companies have also found these tools problematic, the study notes.
In 2018, for example, Amazon announced it had scrapped the development of an AI-powered recruitment engine because it could detect gender from CVs and discriminated against female applicants.
Of particular concern to the researchers were tools to ""analyse the minutiae of a candidate's speech and bodily movements"" to see how closely they resembled a company's supposed ideal employee.
Video and image analysis technology had ""no scientific basis"", co-author Dr Eleanor Drage told BBC News, dismissing it as ""modern phrenology"", the false theory skull shape could reveal character and mental faculties.
""They say that they can know your personality from looking at your face. The idea is that, like a lie-detector test, AI can see 'through' your face to the real you,"" she told BBC News.
With six computer-science students, the researchers built their own simplified AI recruitment tool, to rate candidates' photographs for the ""big five"" personality traits: 
But the ratings were skewed by many irrelevant variables.
""When you use our tool, you can see that your personality score changes when you alter the contrast/brightness/saturation,"" Dr Drage wrote.
gy news site The Register noted other investigations had reached a similar conclusion. 
A German public broadcaster found wearing glasses or a headscarf in a video changed a candidate's scores.
Hayfa Mohdzaini, from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, told BBC News its research suggested only 8% of employers used AI to select candidates.
""AI can efficiently help increase an organisation's diversity by filtering from a larger candidate pool - but it can also miss out on lots of good candidates if the rules and training data are incomplete or inaccurate,"" she said.
""AI software to analyse candidates' voice and body language in recruitment is in its infancy and therefore carries both opportunities and risks."" "	/news/technology-63228466

18-year-old from Doncaster got into darts at the age of 10. On Friday, she will become the youngest woman to compete at the championship in its 30-year history when she faces world number 37 William O'Connor.
Want to know more about darts' most exciting young player? Here are a few facts about Greaves.
Greaves comes into this tournament in terrific form. The Guardian reports that she has won 66 consecutive matchesexternal-link and eight tournament titles in a row on the PDC Women's Series. Not bad. 
In light of Greaves' performances this year, several of the top male players at the World Championship, including defending champion Peter Wright, have said they do not want to face her.
""Sometimes I forget that I am still a teenager,"" Greaves said. ""I am only 18 and I forget that when I am doing all this stuff.
""I never thought of it as a dream. I was more for just playing the ladies darts and I was content with that. It sort of happened, I didn't plan it or expect it.""
Fallon Sherrock became a trailblazer for women in darts when she got to the third round of the 2020 World Championship. 
However, Greaves beat her at a tournament in Wigan earlier this year to claim a spot at Alexandra Palace.
""I don't want to be compared to Fallon,"" says Greaves. ""What she did was amazing, but I want to do my own thing and just sort of keep to myself and keep enjoying it.""
In April, aged 18, Greaves beat Kirsty Hutchinson 4-0 to win the WDF World Championship.
revious youngest winner of a World Championship was 21. By winning the tournament, she set the record for both male and female competitors. 
Greaves has been given one of the more apt sporting nicknames in 'Beau 'n' Arrow'.
She saidexternal-link that the name was suggested by one of her dad's mates in Doncaster and ended up sticking.
Not too surprisingly, despite all her accolades, Greaves is still a normal teenager in most respects.
""Sometimes you are on a proper high and you come back and mum is having a go about something,"" she said. ""It is such a contrast when you come back from a darting weekend, I have never been treated any differently and I wouldn't want that anyway.""
Greaves has already set the darts world alight. And she is confident that she can go even further.
""I feel like no one has ever seen me play how I can really play,"" she said. ""I feel like I have got gears and I can turn it on when I need to.""

business	Sports Direct owner lifts Asos and Hugo Boss stakes	"wner of Sports Direct has become the fourth-largest shareholder in online fashion retailer Asos.
Frasers Group, which is owned by billionaire Mike Ashley, now owns 5.1% of Asos after building up shares in the company that holds the Topshop brand.  
On Monday, Frasers also announced it had raised its investment in Hugo Boss.
mpany has bought up a number of UK retailers over the past few years spanning sportswear, fashion, furniture and bikes.
It now owns 4.3% of Hugo Boss shares directly and an extra 28.5% through the sale of financial instruments known as put options.
A put option is a contract that allows the owner the right to sell an asset at a future date at a predetermined price. Unlike normal shares, buying put options does not contribute to owning a majority stake or gaining voting rights in a company.
""Frasers Group has extensive ambitions to grow the business inside and outside of the UK and is constantly exploring the potential for further expansion,"" the company said.
retail giant added the move was the latest example of its ""its drive to expand and acquire businesses and brands that can strengthen Frasers Group"".
Asos recently reported a loss as the cost of living hit shoppers' budgets and the company has warned that it expects people to cut back even further in the months ahead. 
fashion brand's share price has fallen by nearly 80% over the past year.
Frasers Group said its latest deal was part of the ""ordinary course of business to develop relationships and partnerships with other retailers, suppliers and brands"".
Mr Ashley, who founded the sportswear retailer Sports Direct, has in the past gone on to take over businesses he invests in, including House of Fraser.  
r he stepped down as chief executive of the company, handing over the role to his son-in-law, Michael Murray, though Mr Ashley remains the controlling shareholder in the group.
Mike Ashley bought up a host of well known brands over the years and it seems that his son in law Michael Murray also has a similar appetite for deals.
Frasers Group has been on a bit of a spending spree this year. It bought Studio Retail out of administration in February followed by online fast fashion retailer Missguided in the summer, and it's also having a tilt at buying the Australian online business My Sale.
Now it's the fourth largest investor in Asos. So what's the new chief executive up to? The best guess is that Frasers is after a commercial relationship with Asos, seeking more exposure to younger fashion shoppers.
Frasers has already said it wants to expand its business both here and abroad. It clearly has the financial firepower to do so.  But taking a stake in Asos could also simply be a financial punt on a business whose share price has crashed in the past year. 
Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said Mr Ashley's latest moves showed ""clearly the retail kingpin is not done with the sector just yet"".
""Asos' financial results revealed some significant problems for the business as spending by its core demographic dries up and the company faces rising costs and a more perilous balance sheet position, but Ashley clearly believes there is still value in the brand,"" she added.
rease in Frasers' shareholding in Asos - first reported by the Sunday Telegraph - will not give it any control over the online fashion business or a position on its board. 
Along with House of Fraser and Sports Direct, the group also owns Flannels, Game, Jack Wills, Evans Cycles and Sofa.com. 
group has also built a significant shareholding in the fashion brand Mulberry. "	/news/business-63370575
technology	Instagram: Posing influencers damage Notting Hill home	"Footage from Mr Lee's doorbell shows people having their picture taken outside his house
Influencers who repeatedly pose for photos outside a bright pink Notting Hill house have caused damage estimated at £2,000, the homeowner has revealed.
Peter Lee said high heels worn by models have cracked the doorstep of his west London home, and his railings had also been damaged.
77-year-old said people used his home for photos ""daily"", with tents even being set up for outfit changes.
However, the retired fashion designer added they were ""usually quite polite"". 
Footage from Mr Lee's doorbell shows people having their picture taken whilst sitting outside his front door. In one video, an individual appears to do the splits whilst grabbing the railings outside his house. 
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, photos of the house in Kensington Place are regularly shared on Instagram, and some posts have received thousands of likes.
Mr Lee said: ""I have actually got a few damaged tiles. The quote for repairing these was £2,000. It's just these girls who wear high heels. The steps are just not made for that.""
He is now cementing over the damage rather than having to pay for the repairs.
Mr Lee, who has lived in the area for over four decades, said models and influencers had been taking pictures outside his home for years, but he had no plans to put up a sign outside to stop them.
He explained he was not upset by the attention his home was getting as it ""wasn't going to harm anyone"". 
""I often have to wait for them to vacate the doorstep. They are usually quite polite but occasionally I have girls look at me and they don't move,"" he said.
""One time there was this really big group. They had changing tents outside. They had two tents there. They take it in turns to sit on the doorstep. They left their bags there and left - they never came back.""

sports	Lesley Sleight: Isle of Man archer enjoys best season yet in 2019	"Veteran Manx field archer Lesley Sleight says 2019 has been her ""best season yet"" after setting three world records during the calendar year. 
Sleight, who competes in the traditional recurve class, also took veteran World and European titles.
56-year-old former teacher from the Isle of Man said she was ""proud"" of her performances, adding: ""I never thought I would get a world record.""
She is the only Manx archer to hold a world field archery record.
Since retiring as a teacher last year, Sleight has been able to focus on her passion for the sport, training on a specially-built scaffold in her garden or utilising local glens and farms. 
In August, she claimed victory in the veteran class at the 3D European Championships, which saw competitors shooting targets in and around the castle in Doorwerth, Netherlands. 
""That was totally new, to shoot upwards in a belfry,"" she said. ""I've not managed a way of practicing uphill shots.""
Sleight set two veteran world records in the process with her score of 292 in the field round on day one and 239 in the hunter round on day two.  
Her opening-day score was enough to take the adult [21 years plus] record but registration restrictions meant she had to wait a month before she could add it to her list of achievements. 
After missing out on the adult record in Doorwerth, Sleight was ""determined to show them"" at the North American Field Championships in September. 
She made a score of 291 in the field round and went on to win the overall title.
A World Veteran Championship victory followed a couple of weeks later after a tense final-day battle with Brazilian archer Clementina Guechewski Riter. "	/sport/archery/50346099

business	Walgreens abandons Boots sale after market turmoil	"US pharmacy giant Walgreens has dropped plans to sell Boots, saying buyers were unable to raise enough funds due to instability in financial markets.
Walgreens said it had various offers for the pharmacy business after it put Boots up for sale in January.
But none of the offers adequately reflected the high potential value of the UK pharmacy chain, it said.
Walgreens Boots Alliance said it would now keep Boots and the No7 beauty brand.
Potential buyers reportedly included Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani and US buyout firm Apollo Global Management, who made an offer valuing the business at about £5bn.
Walgreens merger deal for Boots in 2014 valued the firm at about £9bn at the time.
Walgreens said it had moved away from plans to offload Boots after an ""unexpected and dramatic change"" in the financial markets.
""As a result of market instability severely impacting financing availability, no third party has been able to make an offer that adequately reflects the high potential value of Boots and No7 Beauty Company,"" it said.
Rosalind Brewer, chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, said: ""We have now completed a thorough review of Boots and No7 Beauty Company, with the outcome reflecting rapidly evolving and challenging financial market conditions beyond our control.""
""It is an exciting time for these businesses, which are uniquely positioned to continue to capture future opportunities presented by the growing healthcare and beauty markets.
""The board and I remain confident that Boots and No7 Beauty Company hold strong fundamental value, and longer term, we will stay open to all opportunities to maximise shareholder value for these businesses and across our company.""
Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth said that Walgreens had wanted more for Boots than suitors had been prepared to pay for it.
""Boots needs an awful lot of work,"" she said.
She said raising the necessary funds to buy it would have been difficult in the current market, and that Boots has a ""significant"" pensions liability.
One of the main challenges for Boots, she said, is that it is possible to buy equivalent products from competitors such as supermarkets and online shops.
In addition, Boots used to get a lot of ""lunchtime trade"" from people working in offices in city centres, but now more people were spending time working from home.
173-year-old Boots business includes 2,200 UK stores.
In 2020, Walgreens cut 4,000 jobs at Boots and closed some of its shops as the Covid-19 pandemic hit sales."	/news/business-61966202
politics	Labour left-wingers angry about being blocked as MP candidates	"Labour left-wingers claim they are being prevented from standing for the party at the next general election on flimsy pretexts, as Sir Keir Starmer seeks to remake the party in his own image.
With some MPs retiring and Labour hopeful of making big gains across the country, the battle to be selected as a candidate is heating up. 
But some supporters of former leader Jeremy Corbyn claim they are being frozen out. 
Labour selection process is rather complex but the first step for any would-be candidate is to get on to a longlist (which will, in turn, be whittled down to a shortlist).
Some would-be candidates claim Labour Party staff are being tasked with uncovering historic comments or online activity that can justify stopping an individual before they even get to the longlist. 
Labour's own guidelines say the party's ruling body should ensure that only ""high quality candidates"" are put forward for selection. They insist this is about quality control, rather than spurious blocking for political reasons.
Lauren Townsend, a Labour councillor who hoped to be her party's candidate in Milton Keynes North, was one of those who fell at the first hurdle.
With the backing of six trade unions, she had been confident she had a good chance.
But that changed when she was asked to attend to a ""due diligence"" meeting online, where senior party figures vet candidates to check their suitability. Ms Townsend was sent a dossier of examples of her online activity that had sparked concern.
uded a tweet she had ""liked"" from Nicola Sturgeon, in which the Scottish First Minister announced that she'd tested negative for Covid.
Another ""like"" she was asked to explain was on a tweet of someone joking about Matt Hancock's resignation as health secretary - they had posted a picture of themselves pretending to cry.
Some of Lauren Townsend's activity had been more overtly hostile to the party leadership. She'd ""liked"" a tweet questioning Sir Keir Starmer's fitness for office, and another praising the former shadow cabinet member Andy McDonald when he quit the frontbench.
Labour has stressed that a tweet being in a due diligence report does not necessarily mean it was used as the basis of the panel's decision.
Maurice McLeod hoped to be Labour's candidate in Camberwell and Peckham in South London. This is a safe Labour seat being vacated by the party's former deputy leader Harriet Harman.
As a serving councillor and - as he puts it - an ""upstanding Labour member"" on the left of the party, he felt he had a good shot.
But, like Lauren Townsend, he also failed to get through a due diligence interview.
rving Wandsworth councillor was presented with evidence the party felt undermined his credentials to be a good Labour MP. This included ""liking"" a tweet by Green MP Caroline Lucas where she expressed concern that Brexit could threaten the NHS. 
He had also criticised other Labour councillors online, and had left the council chamber before a vote on a definition of anti-Semitism. Writing for the Guardian, he said he'd ""mistakenly"" left before the vote, blaming ""political inexperience"".
Maurice McLeod believes the real reason for his exclusion is internal politics, and specifically his support of Labour's previous leader Jeremy Corbyn.
He told me ""it's really obvious the party is determined to distance itself from anything it sees as being in the shadow of (Jeremy) Corbyn"".
He believes the due diligence process should be used to root out people who have done ""really dodgy things"", but that it is now being used to block candidates from the left.
Emma Dent Coad says she received similar treatment. She was the Labour MP for Kensington between 2017 and 2019.
She says she was never given a reason for being blocked from standing again, and insists she's been punished for ""thought crime"".
Labour insists all candidates who do not make it through to the selection process are told why.
former MP concedes she's ""not squeaky clean"", but insists she can explain all the factors that were used to stop her standing.
She says they included a joke she had previously made about Prince Harry and referring to the former Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey as a ""token ghetto boy"" (Ms Dent Coad insists she was quoting someone else when she used this term).
She says it would have been emotionally difficult to lose out in a vote of local party members, but to be blocked before that point in the process was ""brutal"".
re are serving Labour MPs who are concerned about what they see as a heavy-handed approach. One from the left of the party told me there were figures at the top who were ""drunk on power"" and their actions went ""beyond anything from the Blair years"".
But for other members, the current approach is the right one. John McTernan, a former advisor to Tony Blair, told me the due diligence process is ""spot on"" and ""very fair"". 
He argues that some people ""not from the Labour tradition"" are trying to become candidates, and that too much ""flotsam and jetsam"" got into parliament under Jeremy Corbyn. 
He says Labour has to return ""good MPs"" with ""mainstream Labour values"" at the next election.
A Labour spokesperson said: ""Due diligence is about weeding out candidates who could cause electoral damage.""
ublic had a right to know all candidates were of a ""high standard"". The party stresses that a diverse range of candidates have made it through to selection. 
One long-serving parliamentarian, Jeremy Corbyn, is also at the centre of a selection row.
As things stand, he will not be the Labour candidate in Islington North, after losing the party whip in a long-running row with Sir Keir Starmer over comments he made about a report on anti-Semitism.
One left-wing Labour MP I spoke to, on condition of anonymity, said many in the party felt Mr Corbyn's suspension was ""politically motivated"".
Adding to the anxiety on the left, some Labour MPs are facing de-selection battles in their local constituencies.
Sir Keir Starmer may have made himself very unpopular with some would-be Labour candidates, but he appears to believe this is a necessary sacrifice to win back parts of the country the party has lost."	/news/uk-politics-63636469
sports	Max Milne: Scottish climber targeting Olympic gold after rise from tragedy	"Max Milne credits his climbing career with keeping him grounded amid a backdrop of tragedy.
Scot was 10 years old when he took up the sport as a distraction from his mother Catherine's cancer diagnosis.
More than a decade later, it has provided emotional stability and shaped the man he is today.
""My dad wanted me and my sister to keep busy and not just think about mum's situation 24-7 because it was super scary and confusing,"" he tells BBC Scotland.
""I had no idea what was going on, I was 10, I didn't even know what cancer is or what life is.
""She passed away later that year, when I just turned 11. I was so young I didn't know how huge that was and when I was an early teenager, all these emotions were coming up.
""I was starting to be a rowdy boy, and then climbing helped me to settle and find who I wanted to be, so it was powerful.""
Climbing is not a pursuit that runs in the Milne family. But it's perhaps no surprise the 21-year-old from Aberdeen is now making his mark at the highest level. Scaling objects has been second nature to him from an early age.
""I was always climbing up doorframes and everything,"" he adds. ""When we were playing tig as a child, I was always up trees, you can't catch me because I was nowhere to be seen.
""I was the kid who would get the football off the roof at lunchtime. When we used to go to a park, my mum would joke, 'if you can't find Max, just look up'.""
From difficult beginnings, Milne has prospered. His chosen discipline is bouldering, a form of free climbing, and his silver at last weekend's World Cup series event in Italy was Great Britain's first men's medal at that level for 15 years. 
2024 Olympics in Paris is the big target looming on the horizon and he has an unconventional method of motivation.
Sport climbing made its Olympic debut at last summer's Games in Tokyo and will again be part of the roster in two years' time.
""Gold medals man, it is all about that gold medal,"" Milne says. ""It is written on my bedroom in my house in Aberdeen.
""I've graffitied my whole room. I have got some old bib numbers. My first youth medal was also in Brixen - where I got my first senior medal a few days ago - and before that competition I put a nail in the wall and said 'European gold medal'.
""I just visualised it and thought, 'this is where I am going to put my gold medal' - I took a bronze but it is still nice to do stuff like this. I really enjoy having that idea, speaking about it and trying to go and do it.""
Milne has plenty to look forward to, which is entirely apt for an athlete nicknamed 'The Future'.
""A Scottish climber called Robbie Phillips gave me a few coaching sessions when I was younger and he was like, 'this kid is really good, this kid is the future',"" he explains.
""I loved that and then one of my school friends changed my name on Instagram to it, and I was like, 'you know what, I like it. I am the future, lets see how far I can go'. It has built into a little brand, it fits me."""	/sport/sport-climbing/61811169

rapper was named Diversity Champion for his efforts to ""level the playing field"" through his charities Merky Foundation and Merky Books.
""I encourage everyone in the room today to not just use diversity as a buzzword,"" he said in his speech.
""Whatever position you're in... let that be a driving factor, and not just see it as a quota or a box to tick.""
Addressing a room full of music industry executives, he stressed ""the worth and the value"" of embracing a wide range of voices in the workplace.
According to the latest figures from UK Music, 22% of people working in the music industry are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds; while women hold 49.6% of industry roles.
However, career progression for these groups remains sluggish, with representation tailing off in higher age and income brackets. 
Stormzy's Merky Foundation has pledged £10m over 10 years to organisations and charities ""committed to fighting for racial equality, justice reform and black empowerment within the UK"".
It currently supports the Black Heart Foundation, which aims to improve access to education for underprivileged children, and partners with Cambridge University to award £20,000 scholarships to black students.
AIM Awards celebrate achievement in the independent music sector, and Wednesday night's ceremony also saw outstanding contribution awards for The Libertines and Lethal Bizzle - both of whom performed at the after party in London's Roundhouse.
Soul singer Cleo Sol won best independent album for her thoughtful, intimate album Mother, which juxtaposes her feelings about becoming a new mother with the turbulent relationship she had with her own family.
Indie duo Wet Leg, whose debut album is up for this year's Mercury Prize, won best breakthrough; while their fellow Mercury nominees Nova Twins won best track for the defiantly raucous Antagonist.
US singer Mitski, who supported Harry Styles on his UK tour this summer, was named best live performer, while pop alchemist Rina Sawayama took home the innovation award.
Up-and-coming artist Nia Archives was crowned this year's ""one to watch"", as she spearheads a revival in the jungle scene.
And London singer-songwriter Nilufer Yanya won the BBC 6 Music ""difficult second album"" prize for her critically-acclaimed record, Painless.
winners' trophies all carried the symbol for Autistic Pride Day, as part of AIM's own commitment to diversity.

politics	SNP preparing for general election, says Ian Blackford	"SNP is preparing for a general election as time ""needs to be up"" for the Tory government, the party's Westminster leader has said.
Ian Blackford said people in Scotland would be appalled at the idea of Boris Johnson returning as prime minister.
Speculation has grown over whether the former PM would join the race, although Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy declined to comment on the matter.
Meanwhile, Scottish Labour said a general election was ""inevitable"".
Commons leader Penny Mordaunt is so far the only contender to have officially launched a leadership campaign following the resignation of Liz Truss.
Rishi Sunak has become the first potential Tory candidate to secure backing from the 100 MPs needed to enter the race, while Boris Johnson has flown back to the UK following his Caribbean holiday.
Supporters have publicly rallied behind the ex-prime minister.
However, Ian Blackford said it would be ""beyond the pale"" for him to return given the Partygate scandal, during which Mr Johnson become the first prime minister to receive a criminal penalty while in office.
Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, the Mr Blackford said: ""It is almost beyond belief that the Conservatives would even consider this.
""You really have to question what the Conservatives are thinking if they think it is reasonable and rational to bring this man back into some kind of leadership contest. We don't want Boris Johnson anywhere near power.""
Confirming that the SNP are preparing for a general election, he added: ""It shouldn't just be down to Tory MPs and Tory members to pick the next prime minister.""
ry leadership hopefuls have until 14:00 BST on Monday to find 100 MP backers. If any candidate reaches 158 nominations out of the 357 Tory MPs the race will be reduced to two candidates, as there will not be enough MPs left to support a third candidate.
It will then go to an online ballot of the Conservative party membership, with the result to be announced on Friday.
But if the party's MPs get behind just one candidate, there could be a new prime minister by Monday afternoon.
Scottish Conservative Party chairman Craig Hoy refused to comment on the prospect that Mr Johnson could run in the contest.
Mr Hoy told Good Morning Scotland: ""In relation to myself as party chairman, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculation about candidates.""
However, he said a general election would be a ""huge distraction"" at a time when stability was needed.
""What we need now is stability for the good of the country, so that the UK government can help people through the difficult times ahead and start to rebuild our public services,"" he said.
With a new prime minister due to be installed by Friday, Mr Hoy said he hoped ""the party unites behind that candidate and we can move forward"".
But Scottish Labour's Daniel Johnson said a general election ""may be necessitated by events"" as he too decried the possible return of Mr Johnson.
He said: ""With Boris Johnson, I think we're headed for a full-blown crisis.
""It's not just the Labour Party saying that is unacceptable, plenty of their MPs are saying it would be unacceptable and they would quit.""
Speaking about the situation the UK is now in, the Labour MSP added: ""The country's paralysed.
""I think we may very well end up in the situation where a general election is inevitable, in fact it is required to cut through the complete chaos that is at the heart of the UK government because of the Conservative Party."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63357651
politics	Welsh government 'bypassing Senedd' through UK laws	"Criticism has been made about the Welsh government relying on Westminster to make laws that ""bypass the Senedd"".
Recently there has been a big increase in legislation going through the UK Parliament that covers policies usually controlled from Cardiff Bay.
A report by a cross-party committee said the trend ""could undermine the Senedd... and the underlying principles of devolution"".
Welsh government said it was guided by ""clear principles"".
mplaint came from the Senedd's legislation, justice and constitution committee.
Members of the Senedd (MS) said it was harder for them to see what was going on because of ""behind-the-scenes conversations"" between the Welsh and UK governments.
Even though the Senedd has powers to pass laws in what are known as devolved areas - such as health, education and transport - sometimes Westminster can legislate on them too.
When that happens, MSs have a chance to let Westminster take the reins by voting for legislative consent motions, but these are ""all or nothing"" decisions and do not allow the Senedd to go through legislation in detail.
mmittee, which is chaired by Labour MS for Ogmore, Huw Irranca-Davies, said there had been a big increase in the number of such motions.
re have been 44 since last May's election, compared to 48 for the whole of the 2016-21 Senedd term.
Recent legislative consent motions also hand over ""significantly more"" powers, the report said, meaning detailed scrutiny of laws in devolved fields is happening in Westminster and not in Cardiff Bay.
""This has proved frustrating,"" the report said.
""We would much prefer to have contributed to the improvement of legislation being made in the Senedd as a means of delivering the best possible solutions for communities across Wales - a role for which Senedd members are elected.""
It also means MSs cannot ask First Minister Mark Drakeford and his ministers whether they should be relying on this system in the first place.
mmittee said some aspects of UK government bills - including on the environment and building safety - should have gone through the Senedd instead.
It added: ""Overall, we are therefore concerned that too much legislation in devolved areas is being made in the UK Parliament following behind the scenes conversations between the UK and Welsh governments, bypassing the Senedd's legislative scrutiny functions.
""If this approach continues, which would appear to be the case, there is a danger that it could undermine the Senedd as a legislature and the underlying principles of devolution.""
Welsh government said: ""Our fundamental position is that primary legislation in devolved areas should be enacted by the Senedd.
""There are sometimes circumstances where provision in UK bills can be sensible and advantageous, such as if changes are highly technical or if the relevant Welsh and English administrative systems are closely interconnected.
""Our involvement with UK bills is guided by clear principles including that the existing devolution settlement is either protected or enhanced, and we are committed to ensuring the Senedd is afforded as much scrutiny as possible through the legislative consent process."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63560757
entertainment	Coat of wings flies around the world	"A ""coat of wings"" inspired by Sir Elton John has travelled the world after being passed on to new owners at a series of gigs. 
Donna Ingram created the glittery gold and white-feathered coat to wear for the musical legend's concert.
She never imagined it would have five proud owners within months. 
Yet the humble jacket has since made a transatlantic journey to Chicago and become a symbol of ""love and connection"".
It was in July that Ms Ingram, 44,  from Calstock in Cornwall, donned her creation for the Bristol concert, where she was showered with admiring glances and curious questions from fellow gig-goers.
Ms Ingram, an instructor at Duchy College, was even ""photo-bombed"" by the Rocket Man himself.
Sir Elton, the fifth highest-selling recording artist of all time, is well known for his outrageous outfits including suits adorned with feathers and sequins.
Ms Ingram had ""tried to replicate"" a feathered coat she had seen the performer wear previously.
After meeting Amanda Hawkins in the crowd, Ms Ingram agreed to ""gift"" her the coat, as long as she promised to pass it on again. 
Ms Hawkins said the coat was the ""loveliest she'd ever seen"", adding: ""A few weeks later I took it to Glastonbury."" 
rue to her word, Ms Hawkins passed the coat on to Maria Janjua at Glastonbury Festival.
Ms Janjua said: ""I love the concept. Travelling around the world and bringing a bit of joy into people's lives.
""I love the fact it's being shared at festivals and concerts. Music helps connect us and brings us all together."" 
During Pearl Jam's set at Hyde Park's British Summer Time event, Ms Janjua found a new custodian in Charissa Armon, from Chicago, who had approached her with a compliment about the coat.
Ms Armon, a former actor who was on a European trip, said the coat represented ""connection and love"", adding: ""I felt extraordinarily honoured to be part of it.
""I hope it just keeps going and finds new countries and some day years in the future I'm at a show and see it across the arena.
""It's a sparkly reminder of how we are all right here together.""
At a Lady Gaga gig, Ms Armon could find no worthy owner, but persevered at a Killers concert in her hometown in September, where she presented the symbol of harmony to Rachel Christine, its current owner.

""My memory of the Elton concert is still such a fond one, so to have the coat of wings still spreading the love is fantastic.

business	Is it right to raise interest rates in a recession?	"Bank of England is like the organiser of a bonfire night party. In one hand it has the jerry can full of petrol to fling over the pile of wet logs, in the other there's a fire extinguisher ready to put it out almost at the same time.
's rate rise is designed to dampen down the economy and stamp out entrenched inflation. But the other announcement, that future rises will be limited, and peak interest rates should not rise above 5%, shows just how worried the Bank is about the overall impact on the economy, and especially the mortgage market.
UK is facing the start of a ""very challenging"" two-year recession, according to the Bank, the longest recession ever recorded in official statistics, and yet interest rates will carry on going up, after eight rises, including today's jumbo rise of to 3%. 
As if in recognition of this difficult to explain stance, the Bank has done something it doesn't normally do in the published minutes of its decisions. In order to reassure the markets and the public that rises won't just keep going up at this kind of rate, potentially killing off any sparks of growth, future rises are expected to ""peak lower than priced into financial markets"". 
Governor Bailey told me that the net effect of today's announcements could be that fixed mortgage rates don't reach the 6%-plus level that seemed likely in the aftermath of the mini-budget. Although variable rate mortgages will go up automatically as a result of today's interest rate rise, fixed mortgage rates are influenced more by assumptions about where rates will go over two or five years. Mr Bailey is managing those expectations down, even as he actually raises current rates. It is a tricky manoeuvre.
fferent approach to that taken by, for example, the USA. The rhetoric and actions of the Federal Reserve have been unrelenting in attacking inflation, in saying that they have a bias towards raising rates higher, even than necessary, because moves can always be rowed back.
But the US is in a different situation. The Bank of England's approach reflects the fact that the UK balancing act is much more delicate. The forecast two-year recession would mean zero growth over the entire post-pandemic period, and indeed over the five-year parliament, following the 2019 election.
mic, its aftermath, the war in Ukraine, and the energy shock, are the fuel for all of this of course. But with the Bank and the government pointing to more pain and sacrifice for millions of households, who are already facing multi-thousand pound increases in mortgage, energy and tax bills, people would be forgiven for asking: have decisions made here in Britain served to fan the flames?"	/news/business-63498306
politics	NI Protocol: Poots' suspension of Brexit checks unlawful, court rules	"Edwin Poots' instruction to halt checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from GB was unlawful and taken for political reasons, the High Court has ruled.
urt quashed the instruction of the former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) agriculture minister.  
DUP opposes the Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposed the checks.
A challenge to the legality of the order was brought by a Sinn Féin member, another applicant named Edward Rooney, and Belfast City Council.  
Mr Poots was agriculture minister when he issued the instruction in February 2022, shortly before the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed when the DUP withdrew its first minister in protest against the protocol. 
Since January 2021, food products being sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have required a range of checks and controls due to the protocol.
rotocol is a deal between the UK and EU which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding the need for a hard border with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.
Unionist politicians have condemned what they regard as the imposition of a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Mr Poots said he had received legal advice that he could direct a halt to the checks in the absence of approval for the inspections from the wider Stormont Executive.
At the High Court on Thursday, Mr Justice Colton found the wider executive did not need to approve the checks.
""It is difficult to draw conclusion other than the decision under challenge was an overtly political one, taken for political reasons, and as part of a political campaign directed in opposition to the protocol,"" he said.
By Louise Cullen, BBC News NI agriculture and environment correspondent
judge's comments that Edwin Poots' instruction was ""overtly political"" will come as no surprise to those who have watched the former agriculture minister and his DUP colleagues collapse the assembly in their opposition to the legislation that seeks to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.  
judge recognised there was political opposition to the protocol, but said ""any politically motivated decision"" that was not in accordance with the law was ""unsustainable and must be set aside as a consequence"".
It's a fair bet that, had Mr Poots still been in place, there would be further court action to follow after this decision.  
As it is, it remains to be seen what steps the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs will now take in the absence of a minister.  
formally quash an instruction that never took effect comes as London and Brussels hold more talks to try to resolve the impasse, and after figures this week showed sales to GB had increased in the year since the protocol began to be implemented. 
He said the instruction had been issued at a time when the then DUP First Minister Paul Givan's resignation was imminent, and consistent with the party's previously declared strategy of opposition to the protocol.
""It may well be that for politicians, as the DUP leader said in September 2021 'there are no easy answers when the law requires one thing and politics demands something else',"" the judge said.
""From the court's perspective there is an easy answer and that is that the law must be obeyed.
""Any politically-motivated decision that is in accordance with the law is unimpeachable.
""Every such decision which does not satisfy this indelible standard is unsustainable in law and must be set aside as a consequence.""
Formally quashing Mr Poots' order to staff, Mr Justice Colton confirmed: ""By issuing the instruction on 2 February 2022, the minister was in breach of his legal obligations.
""The instruction was unlawful and of no effect.""
Despite Mr Poots' instruction, border checks on agri-food products entering Northern Ireland have been continuing pending the outcome of the judicial review proceedings.
Anonymity was granted to the Sinn Féin member who brough the challenge because of fears he might be targeted by loyalist paramilitaries."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63983399
business	New Year's Eve parties hit by rail strikes and cost of living	"New Year's Eve celebrations look set to be hit by rail strikes and the cost of living crisis as industry experts say bars and restaurant bookings are down.
One in three reservations were cancelled in December, when the sector lost £2.3bn, UK Hospitality said.
re is ""huge"" concern that strikes will further hit New Year bookings and result in job losses in January, the Night Time Industries Association said.
government says it is doing all it can to mitigate the impact of strikes.
Paul Kohler, owner of the CellarDoor a cocktail and cabaret bar in London's West End, was hoping the first New Year celebrations since coronavirus restrictions would go with a bang. 
But he told BBC Breakfast rail strikes were a big factor in party plans fizzling out. 
""New Year bookings are down again, we are hoping it will be good but people are losing faith in the transport system, they are worried about getting home at night,"" he said.
rain services continue to be hit by cancellations and delays as rail workers stage a series of national strikes in a dispute over pay, job security and working conditions.
Kate Nichols, chief executive of industry organisation UK Hospitality told BBC Breakfast losses in December were worse than expected due to rail worker walk outs.
""We know that when the train strikes were announced... you saw cancellation rates as high as 50-60% in the centre of London and 20-30% around the rest of the country directly attributable to those strike days.""
Meanwhile, with the cost of living in the UK near a record high, people are cutting down on going out at the same time that business running costs are going up.
Angela Baker from Bolton, owns Bakers coffee shop, bar and restaurant in Egerton, and Courses by Bakers restaurant at Turton Golf Club.
She said bookings over Christmas were ""quieter than usual"" and her New Year's Eve tickets were 70% to 80% sold.
""I think they're nervous about what's happening next with the cost of living crisis,"" she added.
""We've found Covid is still impacting us,"" said Ms Baker. ""We've had people cancelling over the last few days due to Covid and lots of staff off ill.""
She said while the costs of running her businesses were rising she did not want to have to up prices when her customers were struggling themselves.
Mr Kohler said he paid his staff the Real Living Wage for London of £11.95 an hour, which is more than the National Living Wage - known as the minimum wage - of £9.50.
Combined with ""costs going up and up"", his ""profits are shrinking"", Mr Kohler said. 
""We don't have any profits at this stage - we are just surviving... hospitality is in real danger at the moment,"" he added.
Many businesses have lost up to 50% of trade during the festive period which they were relying heavily on to see them through early 2023, said Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association.
Mr Kill said the government's delay in announcing any further help on energy bills for businesses had left many facing further uncertainty. 
""We will without doubt now see a huge swathe of businesses and jobs lost in January due to the government's inaction,"" he added.
It comes after the British Beer and Pub Association said 386 pubs closed in England & Wales in 2022, with thousands more looking at altering their opening hours this winter to survive.
going cost of living crisis combined with further strike action means it is ""going to undoubtedly be a very tough first quarter of the year for hospitality"", said Ms Nichols from UK Hospitality.
raditionally, bumper profits in December driven by Christmas celebrations make up for lower takings in January and February, she said.
But this year has seen ""much more profitable sales in December being lost,"" she said. ""That means those businesses are much more vulnerable and fragile.""
Mr Kohler urged ministers to negotiate with rail workers to end strikes and to give more support on energy bills and business rates.
""Hospitality will die unless we get a grip,"" he said.
Ms Baker said: ""I have had a number of friends who have lost or chosen to walk away from the hospitality business post-pandemic, and because of the cost of living.
""I have staff who were landladies who both gave up their pubs and came to work with me,"" she added.
Ms Baker said hospitality businesses like hers relied on busy Christmas and New Year periods to help them weather the quieter winter months ahead.
""With Courses being at a golf club, the season doesn't start again until March so we are expecting a quiet couple of months,"" she said.
""But even with Bakers coffee shop, January is a notoriously tough month because everybody starts the new year with good intentions.""
government said it recognised this was a difficult time for hospitality and night time businesses and said ""we remain firmly on their side"". 
A spokesperson highlighted the Energy Bill Relief Scheme and a Business Rates package they said was worth £13.6billion over the next five years.
""We are doing all we can to mitigate the impact of this strike action, but the only way to stop the disruption completely is for union bosses to get back round the table and call off these damaging strikes,"" the spokesperson said."	/news/business-64124916
technology	NHS warns of scam Covid-test texts	"NHS is warning about widespread scam text messages telling recipients they have been in close contact with a Covid case.
""We've seen reports of fake NHS text messages about ordering Omicron Covid-19 test kits,"" it tweeted.
Close contacts of people who have tested positive are no longer advised to test.
m of the messages appears to be harvesting financial and personal information. 
Several BBC staff have received similar messages linking to newly registered websites associated with dozens of others with names indicating they have also been used in scam Covid test-ordering schemes.
witter users have sought advice after receiving similar texts.
If clicked on, the link in the messages takes the recipient to a fake NHS page asking for personal and financial information. 
In its alert, the NHS says it will ""never ask for bank details, so please be aware of suspicious messages"".
Most people are no longer advised to test for Covid and are ineligible for free tests - but some some pharmacies and shops sell them.
National Cyber Security Centre told BBC News: ""Cyber-criminals are opportunistic and sadly continue to exploit concerns around the coronavirus to trick people into sharing their financial or personal details.""
In 2020, trying to combat phishing attacks, the NCSC helped develop the Suspicious Email Reporting Service with the City of London Police. 
""As a result, we have received 12 million red flags from the public to potential phishing attacks - leading to more than 80,000 scams being removed from the internet,"" it said."	/news/technology-61882239
business	Cost of living: New Zealand steps up fight against soaring prices	"New Zealand's central bank has stepped up its fight against soaring prices, raising its key interest rate to the highest level in over 13 years.
Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) increased its key rate of interest by 0.75 percentage points to 4.25%.
was the biggest rise since the rate, known as the official cash rate, was introduced in 1999.
It comes after the country's annual inflation rate stood at 7.2% in the three months to the end of September.
Like much of the rest of the world, New Zealand has seen the cost of living rise sharply as the global economy emerges from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine has pushed up the cost of fuel and food.
RBNZ's updated forecasts also pointed to the country's economy falling into recession in September next year. A recession is usually defined as when an economy shrinks for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row.
""Because the New Zealand economy is starting from a position of very high inflation and acute labour shortages, an economic contraction is likely,"" the RBNZ said in a statement.
""Trying to avoid an economic contraction by limiting any interest rate increases in the near term would likely lead to a longer period of high inflation. In turn, this would likely result in higher interest rates and a larger contraction eventually being required to bring inflation and employment back to a more sustainable path,"" it added.
Economists at the bank ANZ welcomed the move.
""Hope is not a strategy. The RBNZ Monetary Policy Committee gets that, and deserves a pat on the back for facing the challenges head-on. If the facts change, they'll change their minds. But right now, the fact is that high inflation is looking increasingly entrenched, and dithering would only make the problem worse,"" ANZ Research said in a note to investors.
During a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday, New Zealand's Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the world economy faced a ""year of reckoning"" in 2023.
""Countries will either be in recession or feel like they are,"" Mr Robertson added.
After the RBNZ interest rate announcement, the New Zealand dollar hit a three month high against the US dollar before easing a little.

health	December strike by NHS nurses is biggest in their history	"Nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are to strike for two days next month in what is set to be their biggest walkout in the NHS's history.
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) announced strikes on 15 and 20 December in its pay dispute with the government.
Nurses will still provide emergency care, but routine services will be hit.
RCN said it had been given no choice after ministers would not reopen talks, but the government said the 19% pay rise demanded was unaffordable.
RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: ""Ministers have chosen strike action.
""Nursing staff have had enough of being taken for granted, enough of low pay and unsafe staffing levels, enough of not being able to give our patients the care they deserve.""
Under trade union laws, the RCN has to ensure life-preserving care is provided during the strikes, which will last from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT.
Watch this video quiz to test your knowledge of nurses' pay
kely to mean some urgent cancer services, urgent tests and scans and ongoing care for vulnerable patients will be protected alongside A&E and intensive care - although it will be up to local health bosses and union leaders to negotiate exact staffing levels on strike days.
Share your experiences. Get in touch.
But it seems almost certain the walkout will increase the backlog in non-urgent hospital treatment - a record seven million people are already on the waiting list in England.
Louise Ansari, from the Healthwatch England patient watchdog, said she was ""concerned"" about the impact on this group of patients.
Hospital nurse Shaun Williams only started working as a nurse a year ago.
He said the thought of striking makes him sad, but he is prepared to do it.
""I am sorry we are having to do this. 
""But we are doing it for the right reasons, we are doing it for patient safety.
""You are running on reserves most days. We do not have enough staff and because of the lack of nurses, patients are at risk.
""Unless we pay nurses more we are not going to attract people or keep people.""
And he says unless the situation changes he may even quit nursing.
GP services, however, will be unaffected as nurses working in practices were not entitled to take part in the ballot.
And because a series of individual ballots were held at NHS trusts and boards rather than one national ballot, nurses at more than 40% of England's hospitals, mental health and community services are not entitled to strike because the turnout was too low in those votes.
However, walkouts can happen at all of Northern Ireland's health boards and in all-but-one in Wales, the Aneurin Bevan.
What is not clear yet is just how many of the services where strike action can take place will see walkouts. 
It is possible the RCN could stagger the action so some services go on strike in December, with others to follow suit next year if the industrial action continues.
It is seen by the union as a way of limiting the disruption to patients, while keeping the pressure on the government.
Individual NHS trusts and boards will not find out until next week whether they will see walkouts on the two dates, because that is when the formal notices will go out.
RCN has called for a rise of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which currently stands at above 14%, but no UK nation has offered close to that.
In England and Wales, NHS staff, including nurses, have been given a rise of at least £1,400 - worth about 4% on average for nurses.
In Northern Ireland, nurses are yet to receive a pay award because there is no working government.
Strike action has been suspended in Scotland however after the government there made a fresh offer worth more than 8% for a newly-qualified nurse. More senior nurses are being offered less. The RCN said it was considering the offer.
During the ballot, the results of which were announced two weeks ago, the RCN had argued this year's below-inflation pay award came after years of squeezes on nurse's salaries. 
But England Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the RCN's demands were not affordable, adding he ""deeply regretted"" union members would be taking action.
He pointed out the government had met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in giving its award.
And it followed a 3% pay rise last year, in recognition of work during the pandemic, despite a public-sector pay freeze.
""Our priority is keeping patients safe. The NHS has tried and tested plans in place to minimise disruption,"" he added.
Welsh government said it was unable to enter pay talks without extra funding from the UK government.
Labour shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said talks should restart - although he would not commit to paying the above-inflation pay rise the RCN was seeking.
""Why on earth is the health secretary refusing to negotiate with nurses? Patients will never forgive the Conservatives for this negligence.""
will only be the second time RCN members have been on strike.
In 2019, nurses in Northern Ireland walked out over pay, while nurses who are members of Unison in England walked out in 2014 over pay.
A host of other major health unions, including Unison, the Royal College of Midwives, GMB and Unite, have all started balloting members."	/news/health-63746334

Lofi Girl channel - famous for its anime-inspired thumbnail - plays relaxing hip-hop music on a loop as a study and sleep aid.
On Sunday, its creator announced its ""radios"" had been silenced after two years of continuous streaming, sparking an outcry from fans.
YouTube has since confirmed the original claim was ""abusive"".
Lofi Girl has built up 10 million subscribers with its regularly updated mixes of low-fidelity, instrumental music.
It has inspired countless memes, Halloween costumes and even a quarantine parody version by Oscar-winning actor Will Smith.
's two streams - beats to relax/study to and beats to chill/sleep to - have almost 800 million combined views and have racked up 21,000 hours of playtime.
When both went down, fans were quick to assume it meant the death of ""a hugely important part of YouTube culture"".
One wrote: ""Lofi girl has helped me survive so many stressful study times. I loved watching 'live' and knowing that many people were also listening too.""
But some managed to find a funny side to it, joking that the anime character was ""finally ready for her exams"". 
When the ban was reversed, Lofi Girl's owner thanked fans for their support but said they were ""shocked and disappointed"" that false claims were not checked more thoroughly. 
""At the end of the day, it was entirely out of our control, and the sad part is that there was no way to appeal beforehand,"" they tweeted.
""We put in our best efforts to maintain high-quality livestreams around the clock for our audience and ensure they comply with streaming policy, leaving no reason for them to be taken down.""

technology	Ofcom report shows growing 5G coverage	"About seven in 10 UK properties can now get 5G reception from at least one mobile operator, says a new report from media regulator Ofcom.
up from about half of all UK households 12 months ago, the Connected Nations report said.
umber of mobile phones able to use 5G has also risen significantly, doubling in the past year to one in five handsets, the Ofcom report found.
But some consumers say the connection speed is disappointing.
5G has received lots of investment from the mobile operators and government and is hailed as a faster, more reliable connection.
re are about 12,000 5G mobile sites now in the UK, almost double last year's figure: 86% of those are in England, 8% in Scotland, 4% in Wales and 2% in Northern Ireland.
Mark Jackson, of ISPreview.co.uk, told the BBC that 5G rollout has been ""slowed a bit"" by the government's decision to order networks to remove technology from Huawei by 2027, which ""caused engineers at most of the operators to focus on removing and replacing related 4G and 5G kit"".
5G traffic - the amount of voice and data flowing over the network - has trebled over the past 12 months and now corresponds to nearly 10% of all mobile traffic.   
A BBC report heard from a number of people who were disappointed with the performance of 5G they experienced.
Ofcom analysed crowdsourced data from Opensignal to help judge the quality of service across the UK. 
It found for 5G devices many more areas achieve a ""high performance"" level than for non-5G devices, but found that - even for 5G - few areas met the ""highest performance"" level. 
Ofcom told the BBC it wanted to see investment in 5G networks. 
It said ""The UK's mobile companies are still in the process of rolling out 5G and are at different stages of extending their networks. So customers' experience will vary by their location and network.
""We'll be taking further steps over the coming year to shine a light on this, so people can see for themselves which operators are leading the way for quality of service."" 
me report found more than 12 million households - 42% of UK homes - now have the option to get a full-fibre broadband connection, an increase of 4.3 million from last year.
Full-fibre connections and upgraded cable networks can deliver download speeds of one gigabit per second (Gbit/s) or higher - fast enough to download an HD movie in under a minute.
report found 70% of UK homes could receive a Gigabit-capable connection. Last year they were available in less than half the UK. 
But only about 25% of households are taking up these faster connections, according to Ofcom.
Mr Jackson said after recent ""dramatic"" improvements in coverage, largely on the basis of private sector investment, he expected ""gigabit coverage to grow more slowly"".
Nearly 80,000 homes and businesses do not have access to ""decent"" broadband, defined as offering download speeds of 10 Mbit/s the report notes. That is fast enough to stream an HD film or game, but will run into problems if more than one person tries to stream at once.
figure has fallen from 123,000 last year, with Ofcom acknowledging that many of those still without ""decent"" broadband are in the hardest-to-reach parts of the UK. 
regulator said it estimates that a further 15,000 properties will be covered by publicly-funded broadband schemes going ahead in the coming 12 months.
government recently announced plans for a trial of Elon Musk's Starlink system to provide broadband to some of the most inaccessible locations in the UK. Starlink uses a constellation of thousands of low Earth orbit satellites to deliver a broadband connection.
f Starlink surprised some commentators, as the government owns a stake in another rival broadband-via-satellite firm, OneWeb.
government told the BBC it was down to ""the readiness and availability"" of Starlink's technology. 
Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it continued to discuss ""other solutions and services"" with suppliers, ""including OneWeb, at more complex sites""."	/news/technology-63974085
health	Londonderry: Future of Shantallow GP practice in doubt	"A Londonderry GP practice is at risk of closure after it handed its contract back to the Department of Health.
rtment said it was working to ensure an alternative service is put in place for the patients who attend the Racecourse Medical Group practice.
It confirmed that the department would retain the contract to deliver services for the next six months.
A recruitment process would now begin to put other arrangements in place, the department have said.
""Patients at the practice do not need to take any action,"" the department told BBC Radio Foyle. 
It will now be writing to all practice patients in the Shantallow practice to keep them informed as the process begins.
It is understood GPs at the Racecourse Road practice in Shantallow have decided to hand the contract to the strategic planning and performance group (SPPG) ahead of the retirement of a partner.
""The news that the management of the Racecourse Medical Group have handed back the contract is causing extreme concern for people in this area,"" Social Democratic and Labour Party councillor Brian Tierney said. 
""People have built relationships with the staff who provide an excellent standard of care and people in this community would be devastated to see it close.
""While the surgery will continue to operate as normal for at least the next six months, we need to see urgent action from the Department of Health to find new management so that it can continue to provide services to people in this area.""
move comes as one of Northern Ireland's largest GP practices, Maple Healthcare in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh, is at risk of closure after its operator handed its contract back to the department.
On Friday, two surgeries in Ballymena also indicated that they intended to resign affecting about 7,000 patients.
""It is very worrying when we hear it in specific areas, it's worrying when we hear it happening right across Northern Ireland,"" the British Medical Association (BMA) said.
Dr Alan Stout from the organisation said more and more practices were ""really struggling to cope, struggling to keep doors open, struggling to pay staff and also struggling to keep up with demand"".
""We are hearing far too frequently from all areas that practices are simply saying that they can't deal with it anymore and are handing back their contracts,"" he added. 
Dr Stout said as soon as a GP practice handed its contract back the ""clock starts ticking"".
""In most cases it will be six months until a contract is actually advertised after it has been handed back,"" he said.
""Everybody will then try their best to get a new contractor, like a new GP, or it might be an agreement with other practices... or worst case scenario patients will then be allocated to other practices.""
Across Northern Ireland, the number of GP practices has fallen by just under 9% in eight years according to Department of Health Figures.
Belfast - Flax Medical Centre, Belfast, County Antrim
Northern - Ballymena Family Practice, Ballymena, County Antrim
South Eastern - Priory Surgery, Holywood, County Down

politics	Teachers' strike in Scotland to go ahead as new pay offer rejected	"Scotland's biggest union of teachers will take industrial action on Thursday after a new pay offer was dismissed as ""insulting"".
Employer Cosla made the fresh proposal which will see rises of up to 6.85%.
It was an improvement on the previous offer of 5% but still well below the 10% the unions want. 
rike by members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) will lead to the closure of most schools in Scotland. 
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville believed the offer was fair and recognised that the ""cost of living crisis is the priority"".
Under this latest proposal teachers earning less than £40,107 would receive an extra £1,926 a year - equivalent to a 6.86% uplift for the lowest paid.
wo bands were being offered a 5% uplift, with those on £60,000 or more receiving no more than £3,000.
Ahead of the new offer being made, the education secretary told the Scottish Parliament that the 10% demand by teacher representatives was ""unaffordable"" for the Scottish government.
EIS said its salaries committee unanimously rejected the offer in a special online meeting on Tuesday. 
Its general secretary Andrea Bradley said it was a ""divisive offer...which is actually worse for many teachers in promoted posts"".
""Our members will see this offer for exactly what it is - a kick in the teeth from their employers and the Scottish government,"" she added. 
""This afternoon's salaries committee expressed outrage at this offer, and that outrage is sure to be replicated in staffrooms across Scotland today and tomorrow. 
""Our programme of strike action, which will commence as scheduled on Thursday, will clearly show the strength of feeling of Scotland's teachers who will be out in numbers and with strong voice on picket lines and at regional rallies.""
A spokesman for the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association (SSTA), which is planning a strike on 7 and 8 December, described it as a ""very disappointing offer"". 
""The unions have been led down the garden path by Cosla and the Scottish government and tell us they care about teachers and value their commitment over the last few years,"" the spokesman said.
""This offer will not go down well with teachers and I would expect the planned strikes to go ahead. Maybe they will listen to parents and children as they are not listening to teachers.""
Meanwhile a third teachers' union - the NASUWT - says its members have voted for strike action, which will take place on 7 and 8 December. 
will take action short of strike action from 9 December, refusing to cover for absent colleagues and attending no more than one meeting per week outside pupil sessions. 
Mike Corbett, the union's national official Scotland, said: ""Our members are angry, demoralised and have had enough. 
""They are sick of being expected to put up with declining wages while working ever harder to meet the increasing challenges being faced in our schools. They are facing increasing financial hardship with more teachers having to cut back on basic necessities.""
Cosla, the umbrella body for Scotland's 32 councils, had called on the EIS to postpone Thursday's strike.
Spokeswoman Katie Hagmann said: ""We have worked extremely hard and closely with Scottish government to ensure such a revised offer could be brought forward and made today. 
""I would call on our trade union colleagues to recognise that these are extremely challenging financial times we are operating in and we all need to make decisions with a full understanding of the consequences.
She added that it was is ""in line with offers made to all other parts of the public sector"".
Meanwhile the Scottish Conservatives were highly critical of the education secretary's role in the negotiations with teaching unions. 
""It should never have reached the stage where the SNP Government were scrambling around at the eleventh hour trying to strike a deal with teachers, and it's no surprise that this last-gasp offer has been rejected,"" Stephen Kerr, the party's education spokesman said. 
""Shirley-Anne Somerville has been missing in action as strikes have loomed large for months...The whole saga has shown that Shirley-Anne Somerville lacks the leadership required to resolve disputes satisfactorily."""	/news/uk-scotland-63715723

technology	Anti-vax groups use carrot emojis to hide Facebook posts	"Facebook groups are using the carrot emoji to hide anti-vax content from automated moderation tools.
BBC has seen several groups, one with hundreds of thousands of members, in which the emoji appears in place of the word ""vaccine"".
Facebook's algorithms tend to focus on words rather than images.
groups are being used to share unverified claims of people being either injured or killed by vaccines.
Once the BBC alerted Facebook's parent company, Meta, the groups were removed.
""We have removed this group for violating our harmful misinformation policies and will review any other similar content in line with this policy. We continue to work closely with public health experts and the UK government to further tackle Covid vaccine misinformation,"" the firm said in a statement.
However, the groups have since re-appeared in our searches.
One group we saw has been around for three years but rebranded itself to focus on vaccine stories, from being a group for sharing ""banter, bets and funny videos"" in August 2022. 
rules of the very large group state: ""Use code words for everything"". It adds: ""Do not use the c word, v word or b word ever"" (covid, vaccine, booster). It was created more than a year ago and has more than 250,000 members.
Marc Owen-Jones, a disinformation researcher, and associate professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, was invited to join it.
""It was people giving accounts of relatives who had died shortly after having the Covid-19 vaccine"", he said. ""But instead of using the words ""Covid-19"" or ""vaccine"", they were using emojis of carrots. 
""Initially I was a little confused. And then it clicked - that it was being used as a way of evading, or apparently evading, Facebook's fake news detection algorithms.""
In 2021 data from the Office for National Statistics suggested that there was a one in five million risk of dying from the Covid vaccine, compared with a risk of 35,000 deaths per five million of dying from Covid itself, if unvaccinated.
giants use algorithms to trawl their platforms for harmful content - but they are primarily trained on words and text, wrote Hannah Rose Kirk in a blog for the Oxford Internet Institute.
Ms Rose Kirk was part of a research team which created a tool called HatemojiCheck: a checklist for identifying areas where AI systems do not handle emoji-based abuse very well.
""Despite having an impressive grasp of how language works, AI language models have seen very little emoji,"" she said. ""They are trained on a corpora of books, articles and websites, even the entirety of English Wikipedia, but these texts rarely feature emoji.""
forms have already come under fire for failing to block or remove emojis of monkeys and bananas when posted as a racist gesture on the accounts of black footballers.
Rio Ferdinand: ""I have to explain the monkey emoji to my kids""
If the Online Safety Bill comes into law in the UK, the tech giants will face steep penalties for failing to identify and quickly removing harmful material on their platforms. But there are concerns that tools currently in use are not good enough to cope with the sheer volume of content that is posted, and the nuance and cultural differences that can cloud meaning.
Emojis can have multiple meanings, alongside whatever is officially declared by Unicode, the consortium which manages them.
US Drug Enforcement Agency issued a poster demonstrating how emojis can be used to discuss illegal drugs.
""It's a modern form of steganography: writing and hiding a message in plain sight, but such that unless you know where to look you don't see it,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber-security expert at Surrey University.
""What all of this demonstrates is the futility of trying to automate moderation of content to prevent the sharing of 'harmful' material,"" he said. ""At the very best you will be playing a game of whack-a-mole, as people develop new dialects with which to communicate.""
Facebook said last year that it had removed more than 20 million pieces of content containing misinformation about Covid-19 or the vaccine since the start of the pandemic.
It also says it removes content which claims vaccines in general are more dangerous than the disease they protect against, or that they are toxic.
US President Joe Biden has criticised the tech giants for not doing enough to tackle the spread of misinformation about the vaccine online. 
He said he hoped Facebook will do more to fight ""the outrageous misinformation"" about coronavirus vaccines being spread on its platform."	/news/technology-62877597
politics	What's happening in Parliament this week?	"'Twas the week before Christmas and all through the Houses of Parliament, barely a legislator was stirring... with a low-key agenda where the gentle slide towards the holiday will be broken only by a couple of big committee hearings, or possibly by ""events, dear boy"". 
Commons breaks up on Tuesday, so there will be no Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, but Rishi Sunak will still face questioning from the Liaison Committee of senior MPs. 
Connoisseurs will recall their last close encounter with a PM, back in July - that surreal session with Boris Johnson solemnly discussing his policies as his government disintegrated around him. Liz Truss didn't last long enough to get a gig at the Liaison Committee, and this will be Rishi Sunak's debut before it. 
Commons: (14:30) Home Office Questions start the week, after which Labour's Andrew Western will take his seat having won the Stretford and Urmston by-election.
main debate will be the second reading of the Seafarers' Wages Bill - a measure to ensure that seafarers working out of UK ports are paid the national minimum wage while in UK waters. The bill is part of the government's response to the outrage caused when P&O Ferries sacked 800 staff without notice earlier this year. It has already cleared the Lords. 
will probably leave plenty of time for a government statement or some other significant item to be dropped in at short notice. 
journment debate sees Labour MP Sam Tarry, recently deselected by his local party, discussing pay and conditions for NHS nurses.
Westminster Hall: (16:30) MPs debate e-petition 604509, 'Create a National Sleep Strategy', which notes that since 2018 schools have referred 1,400 children without beds to a bed poverty charity, and says this should be seen as a key public health issue affecting educational outcomes for children across the UK. The petition attracted 18,496 signatures. 
Committees: Public Accounts (16:00) looks at the work of the Passport Office, including this summer's passport debacle when it was overwhelmed by post-Covid demand and thousands of people missed holidays and important travel for sickness and funerals. Top Home Office officials including Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft will give evidence. 
Lords: (14:30) The main event is the first of five days of committee scrutiny of the National Security Bill. This is the probing, shadow boxing phase of detailed debate, where amendments are not pushed to a vote, but the arguments tee up amendments at report stage in the new year. There's already a lot of chatter about several aspects of the legislation, including a proposed register of ""foreign influence"". 
One influential voice already asking questions is Lord Anderson of Ipswich, a former reviewer of anti-terror legislation. He's already tweeted that the register is ""an ill-directed and vastly overboard control on foreign lobbying, not a national security measure"". Ministers will have a chance to answer those concerns.
re's also a short debate on plans to improve trade and investment relations with countries in Central America.
Commons: (11:30) Treasury Questions start the day. 
re will then be a ten minute rule bill; Conservative Darren Henry wants to boost shared parental leave. 
main debate will be the traditional end-of-term one where any MP can raise a subject of their choice. 
Westminster Hall: MPs debate family businesses (09:30); the future of rail services (11:00); the expansion of the London's ultra-low emission zone (14:30); the Energy Charter Treaty (16:00); and affordable childcare (16:30).
Committees: The big event is the appearance of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak before the Liaison Committee, the super-committee of select committee chairs, presided over by Sir Bernard Jenkin. The session has been divided into four segments, starting with global issues, including the war in Ukraine, migration, and the COP27 climate summit, with questioning conducted by Clive Betts of the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, Philip Dunne (Environmental Audit), Dame Diana Johnson (Home Affairs), and Alicia Kearns (Foreign Affairs). 
xt section is on the UK's place in the world and the state of the Union, featuring Sir Bill Cash (European Scrutiny), Joanna Cherry (Human Rights), Robin Walker (Education), and Pete Wishart (Scottish Affairs). 
Next will be economic issues, including the Autumn Statement and the cost of living, with Harriett Baldwin (Treasury), Steve Brine (Health and Social Care), Sir Robert Neill (Justice), and Sir Stephen Timms (Work and Pensions). Finally there's a cross-issue segment featuring Catherine McKinnell (Petitions). 
Earlier (10:00), Health and Social Care has a session on ambulance delays and strikes, with evidence from emergency health chiefs and the GMB union talking about waiting times and preparations for ambulance strikes, and what is being done to provide a safe level of emergency cover for the public during strike action after Health Minister Will Quince told MPs it was ""likely"" the most serious and life-threatening calls, categories 1 and 2, would be responded to. New chair Steve Brine promised more topical hearings - and this is the kind of rapid response hearing he had in mind. 
Lords: (14:30) The main event is the Finance Bill - this being a money bill, and therefore untouchable in the Lords, peers will take the second reading and remaining stages of debate in a single gulp. There might be some grumbles, but they're not allowed to make any changes.
Commons will have departed, but the Lords (11:00) beaver on with day 2 of committee on the National Security Bill. 
re's also a short debate led by crossbencher Lord Bird on the government's estimates of the savings that might be realised by their cost-cutting initiative. 
Committees: Justice and Home Affairs (10:00) hears from Home Secretary Suella Braverman. 
After that - barring an emergency recall - Parliament will be in recess until Monday 9 January, "	/news/uk-politics-64004891
sports	London Marathon 2022: Running for charity 'a chance to give back'	"When Hannah Delmas was diagnosed with a rare ovarian cancer in 2020, she didn't think she'd be running a marathon just a few years later.
""With my chemotherapy, I spent a lot of time lying in bed or at home, and lost quite a lot of muscle mass through because of being in intensive care,"" she says.
25-year-old doctor will be running for the charity Young Lives vs Cancer, which helps young people going through cancer treatment and the aftermath.
Like Hannah, Chris Reid will be lacing up his running boots and taking on the iconic 26.2-mile route around London.
Chris, also 25, has a learning disability and bipolar disorder, but that hasn't stopped him from competing in running events. His latest though, for the charity Mencap, will be the hardest yet.
""I'll actually give back to the charity that's been part of my history,"" he says.
rganisation, he says, has supported him with things like communication, Maths, English and work experience.
Chris, who previously lived with his parents, has since moved into supported housing and the help he receives has contributed to him becoming more confident with everyday activities such as managing his own money.
Hannah graduated early from medical school in 2020, because of the Covid pandemic, to help ""ease some of the pressures on the NHS"".
But she was then hit by the news that she had a rare ovarian tumour, having to pause her career to start chemotherapy.
After several rounds of treatment, surgery and a stay in intensive care to remove the tumour, she was back caring for patients six weeks after her final treatment.
, between work and follow up check-ups, she signed up to run the marathon despite her lack of experience in running.
""I'm not a runner, I think I've ran once in primary school and secondary school, but I've never really done much since."" 
re have been challenges in training, such as building up fitness levels after intensive treatment, and her busy schedule as a doctor.
Another challenge was finding sportswear that didn't rub on her scars from her surgery.
""I think my preparation probably could have been a little bit better. But it's now too late."" 
Chris, on the other hand, feels he is more than ready, with his prep ranging from light 5k park runs on Saturdays to a training programme of 16 weeks.
But he emphasises it's not just about the running, as his nutritional diet of ""brown rice, eggs and avocado"" is just as important.
Chris was inspired to get into running because of Sir Mo Farah's double gold medal-winning performances at London 2012.
His first run after seeing Sir Mo's success was tough and incomplete, but he persevered after a friend encouraged him and told to ""keep on going"".
He says running and taking in the air ""clears things out"" of his head and helps his mood.
And while some may be worried about completing the marathon, Chris confidently says he'll channel his inner Mo Farah and ""be able to complete it"".
Crossing the finish line is what Hannah is looking forward to most.
""Just having the relief of finishing and knowing that I've completed a marathon as well as seeing everybody else at the finish line.""
For people in a difficult situation like Hannah has been in, she says it's important ""to take it one day at a time"".
""Make little goals that you can complete because I know how frustrating it is to finish treatment, and then think it's fine for everything to go back to normal.""
""Don't give up on your dreams and keep going even through tough times,"" Chris adds.

politics	Autumn Statement: What does it mean for Wales?	"r has set out his tax and spending plans, confirming the UK is in a recession.
With thresholds frozen many will pay more in income tax as pay rises.
Welsh government can expect £1.2bn extra over two years, but Labour ministers are unlikely to say it is enough to cover inflation.
rgy price guarantee will rise from £2,500 to £3,000 for the average household, with payments for people on low incomes.
fits and pensions can expect them to increase by inflation next year, while the National Living Wage will rise by 9.7%.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: ""This is a balanced plan for stability, a plan for growth and a plan for public services.""
Labour Welsh government Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said she was ""really disappointed"" by an Autumn Statement which ""just doesn't come close to meeting the gap that we've identified in public service provision"".
""That's because mainly because of inflation and the impact that that's having on the overall Welsh government budget,"" she told BBC Wales.
Cardiff University researchers warned the autumn statement leaves Welsh government ministers with difficult decisions.
freezing of the point that people start to pay income tax means that many will pay more in tax as their wages rise.
Jeremy Hunt announced that the personal allowance threshold will be held at £12,570, and the higher rate will stay at £50,270, until 2028.
wo years longer than already planned. The national insurance threshold will also stay the same.
Currently there are 1,490,000 income tax payers in Wales, with 1,290,000 paying the basic rate and 166,000 on the higher rate.
rate will see their threshold fall from £150,000 to £125,140. 
Currently only 9,000 pay the additional rate in Wales, although that is likely to grow.
Welsh government could vary the rates themselves in Wales, but never has since it had the powers .
gally-mandated minimum wage rate, known as the National Living Wage, will rise by 9.7% to £10.42.
UK government said it would benefit 110,000 people in Wales.
Working age benefits will rise by 10.1%, and pensioners will receive an inflation-matching rise in the state pension and pension credit.
A UK government survey in 2020-21 suggested that Wales had more people in receipt of state support that any other UK nation - 56% versus 52% for the UK as a whole.
way funding works in the UK means that rises in spending in England means extra cash for the Welsh government.
It funds the NHS, social care, councils and other services in Wales.
UK government says Welsh ministers will have an extra £1.2bn to spend over two years, from 2023-2024 to 2024-25.
Its annual budget is worth around £20bn, but Welsh ministers say soaring inflation has wiped out a big chunk of their spending power, with Labour ministers expected to set out their spending plans in December.
Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University said the money could offset ""about four-fifths"" of a over £500m hit inflation has taken to the government's budget in 2024-25.
""But this still leaves a big budget shortfall in the meantime. There will still be plenty of difficult decisions for the Welsh government at next month's budget,"" the centre's Cian Sion wrote.
Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake said: ""Let's be clear - pressures on Welsh public services will continue to worsen after today's statement due to inflation.""
But Tory Chief Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said the Welsh government was getting a ""significant additional sum of money"".
Mr Glen told reporters: ""I think that there is a very significant settlement for the Welsh government that amplifies the advantages of the decisions we've taken in Whitehall and gives them a significant way of mitigating some of the pressures they face.""
Mr Glen - who said he has spoken to Welsh Finance Minister Rebecca Evans three times since he was appointed - denied that the Autumn Statement was a return to austerity, saying it would reduce the size of the recession ""and we hope the length of it"".
But a Welsh Conservative MP told the BBC they were unhappy with the tax rises announced.
""This is fiscal drag, employed to increase tax revenue by stealth,"" he said. ""It's a straightforward Gordon Brown-Tony Blair New Labour trick and it's not the way a Conservative chancellor should be behaving"".
Conservative Welsh Secretary David TC Davies said: ""The difficult and necessary decisions taken today aim to tackle inflation and restore confidence and stability in the UK economy.""
who benefit from the energy price guarantee will face potentially higher charges as the cap rises.
Bills will be limited to an average of around £3,000 from next April, rather than the current £2,500.
Households on means-tested benefits will get £900 support payments next year, while £300 payments will be made to pensioner households, and £150 for individuals on disability benefit.
who are off-grid, which includes many in rural Wales, and use heating oil, LPG, coal or biomass will benefit from a doubling in support from £100 to £200.
Welsh Secretary David TC Davies previously admitted that the £100 payment was not generous."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63662266
technology	Netflix: Why some viewers are unsubscribing and switching off	"Subscribing to a streaming service can be a bit like ordering a take-away when you don't know what you want to eat - paying the money and hoping what arrives is to your taste.
In recent months, fewer people have become willing to take their chances on the streaming menu, with Netflix losing nearly one million subscribers between April and July - although that was less than the two million it had feared.
As some find the shows less appetising and have their household budgets squeezed, and with Netflix's Covid boom over and rivals trying to cook up a better offering, it seems our streaming tastes are changing.
One of Netflix's lost subscribers is James Leiper, 26, from Huddersfield. ""I bought a house last year, so I thought I needed to take control of what I was spending, and all the monthly subscriptions added up,"" he says.
""At one point, I had four streaming services and it was a lot of money each month for things I barely used. 
""Netflix was the first to go for me because there was only a handful of things on it I was watching.""
Mr Leiper says he is now more mindful of what he spends every month because of things like his electricity and gas bills going up.
""Five or six years ago, I'd watch everything on Netflix, and now there's not so much and I'm not tempted by anything on there,"" he explains.
An increasing number of British households feel the same way about streaming, with 700,000 fewer having at least one subscription compared with the start of the year, according to research firm Kantar. 
Younger viewers have been the most likely to unsubscribe, with more under-24s turning to alternatives like BBC iPlayer or ITV Hub. 
Netflix does remain the world's most popular streaming service, but Tuesday's figures showed its biggest fall in subscriber numbers to date, three months after its first ever drop sent its share price plummeting.
Squid Game, Stranger Things and Bridgerton have given it huge hits, but the company's recent strategy of churning out content has backfired, according to TV critic Hayley Campbell, co-host of the BBC Sounds Must Watch podcast.
""I think Netflix is losing numbers because it keeps pumping out endless shows without stopping to check if they're good,"" she explains.
She says Netflix's ""ratio of rubbish to brilliant is way off"" - but thinks it's now trying harder with shows like Heartstopper.
""Apple TV+ is the most interesting place for TV shows at the moment because it seems to be actually taking risks and investing money in making things like Shining Girls or Severance,"" she says.
Amazon Prime attracted more new subscriptions in the UK than its rivals in the last three months, according to Kantar. 
Campbell adds: ""The most interesting things on Amazon Prime right now aren't made by Amazon, they come from places like HBO.""
Another viewer, Matthew Rose, 26, from Devon, agrees: ""Netflix has great shows like Stranger Things and Squid Game but there's a lot of programmes that aren't high quality.
""The brand doesn't seem premium any more, and I only watch the big hitters because everyone's discussing them.""
He only pays for Disney+, cancelling other streaming services like Spotify last year, and relying on free trials for new customers.
Mr Rose says he accesses most of his content on YouTube ""because it's shorter and it's like a long-form TikTok"" with ""really interesting short documentaries"", which are free.
""I basically only have Disney Plus because I love Star Wars,"" he says.
For Netflix, he piggybacks on his sister's account. ""If she kicked me out then I wouldn't subscribe myself.""
key point about Netflix's share price is that its decline looks structural, rather than a blip. That is because of both the scale and the underlying trends, and the range of factors causing this drop are troubling investors and Netflix's leadership.
Surging global inflation creates a cost-of-living crisis. Ultimately, great television and movies are a (very) nice-to-have, not an essential like food, water or clothing. 
Commercial rivals are exceptionally strong: from Disney to Paramount and Amazon to Apple, the competition is brutal. The likes of Disney have realised that, rather than let Netflix monetise their work, they should do it themselves. So Netflix loses content, as rich rivals grow their libraries. 
A pandemic bump in subscribers, when millions of rich people were staying at home, flattered the figures. The pandemic also halted many productions, choking the supply of fresh shows.
Sharing passwords is one thing Netflix is hoping to crack down on - believing that is stifling growth.
Even the UK Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries does it, recently admitting in Parliament that there were ""four other people in different parts of the country"" using her account.
Streaming firms are also facing the growing phenomenon of flipping subscriptions - people cancelling one and re-starting another depending on which service has something they want to watch at the time.
One thing Netflix hopes will tempt people to stay is a cheaper plan that will carry adverts - although the details and pricing have not been revealed.
And Tuesday's two million fall in subscriber numbers is still relatively small given that Netflix added 18 million subscribers around the world in 2021, which took its total it to almost 222 million.
Amazon Prime Video had 175 million viewers in 2021, and Disney Plus' base topped 118 million.
Despite those huge numbers, traditional TV viewing usually still beats streaming in the UK ratings. At the peak of Squid Game's popularity last year, Barb - the TV ratings agency - found that broadcast programmes like the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing and ITV's Coronation Street attracted more eyeballs.
""The feel of watching TV with lots of people watching at the same time makes it less lonely,"" explains one viewer, Lucy Stirman from Stockton-on-Tees.
""Soaps are drama but easy to watch and it's not a big deal if you dip in and out.
""With Netflix and Amazon Prime, it's more when you know a good movie or series is going to be added and you hear people talking about them.""
32-year-old has not given up her Netflix account, though, explaining that the children's section is played every day for her daughter, who is almost one.
Even if some younger viewers are cancelling, another generation is growing up with streaming."	/news/entertainment-arts-62219598
entertainment	Blue Peter: Bangor man Joel Mawhinney to become 41st presenter	"Bangor-born Joel Mawhinney is to become the newest presenter of long-running children's TV show Blue Peter. 
25-year-old is a magician and content creator who first appeared on the show in 2018 as a guest. 
Joel is the 41st Blue Peter presenter and will co-host alongside Richie Driss, Mwaksy Mudenda and Henry the dog.
His first live show airs on Friday 11 November on CBBC and BBC iPlayer at 17:00 GMT. 
Joel attended Bangor Grammar before going on to pursue his career in entertainment at age 18. 
""Becoming the 41st Blue Peter presenter is a surreal - and dare I say it - magical experience,"" he said. 
""I've always loved making people smile with my magic and I want to do the same for the Blue Peter audience. 
""They have high expectations and I'll do my best to live up to them, I can't wait to get started."" 
Joel guest presented the show over summer 2022 when he taught some of his co-presenters magic tricks. 
His interest in magic started age five and he began performing at the age of 11. 
He is best known for his illusions on social media where he has a huge following, with over 16.5m on one platform alone. He also starred in his own BBC NI TV series ""Life is Magic"" in 2020.
Joel will be thrown in at the deep end in true Blue Peter style with a road trip to Scotland, which will involve cliff jumping into the cold waters of Loch Ard.
Blue Peter editor Ellen Evans said: ""I think that our Blue Peter audience will love the energy and fun he'll bring to the show.""
Joel follows in the footsteps of fellow Northern Ireland presenters Adam Beales, who left the show earlier this year, the late Caron Keating, and Zoe Salmon.
Blue Peter is on CBBC every Friday at 17:00 and is available on BBC iPlayer."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63384122
politics	Good Friday Agreement: Claim Sinn Féin considered 'no' campaign in south	"Sinn Féin was prepared to campaign against the Good Friday Agreement in the Republic of Ireland, a former Irish government advisor has alleged.
Martin Mansergh said Sinn Féin considered the move as the agreement removed Ireland's claim over Northern Ireland in its constitution.
He made the claims in an RTÉ documentary called Two Tribes which is due to be broadcast on Wednesday night.
A Sinn Féin spokesperson said the claims were nonsense.
""Sinn Féin negotiated and supported the Good Friday Agreement and campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum,"" they added.
""The party did not plan to run two different referendum campaigns north and south.""
Mr Mansergh, who was an advisor during the peace process, explained how Sinn Féin's planned opposition to the Good Friday Agreement in the Republic of Ireland had worried the Irish government.
""There was a nervousness you could be exposed to Sinn Féin opposition,"" he said.
""They did contemplate supporting the referendum in the north and opposing it in the south.
""They had literature printed against the changes to articles two and three [of the Irish constitution].""
umentary linked the ""nervousness"" within the Irish government about Sinn Féin opposing the Good Friday Agreement to the decision by the then Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern to release four IRA prisoners known as the Balcombe Street gang who were serving life sentences for a string of murders and bomb attacks in England during the 1970s.
On their release the four men then appeared at a Sinn Fein Ard Fheis (conference) in Dublin supporting the Good Friday Agreement.
Mr Ahern told the programme: ""I took the decision that we should release the Balmcombe Street prisoners who had been sent back on the transfer of prisoners.
""They were released in the afternoon and turned up at the Ard Fheis. I think the euphoria made sure we got across the line.""
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald told the programme Mr Ahern deserved great credit for ""understanding when an opportunity presented, to grab that opportunity and to bring it home"".
At the time the temporary release of the Balcombe Street gang angered the Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, who feared it would damage unionist support for the Good Friday Agreement in the referendum."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64057827
technology	Israel’s balancing act over Ukraine grows trickier after drone strikes	"Israel has repeated its long-standing refusal to sell air defence weapons to Ukraine despite a fresh appeal from Kyiv after this week's ""kamikaze"" drone strikes.
weapons unleashed by Russia were reportedly Shahed-136 drones supplied by Iran - causing Kyiv to make a fresh demand for help saying Tehran's ""complicity"" should be a ""red line"" for Israel. 
Israel and Iran are avowed enemies, but the Israelis have so far refrained from providing Ukraine with weapons in a bid to maintain relations with Moscow.
On Wednesday, Israel's Defence Minister Benny Gantz said their position had not changed. 
""Our policy toward Ukraine is clear - we are on the side of the West, we provided humanitarian aid, took care of refugees and the wounded,"" he told Israel's Kan radio.  
""For obvious reasons, we did not want to involve ourselves in combat systems. This was the policy until now. I am careful about this matter.""
Speaking later to EU diplomats, Mr Gantz said: ""We will not provide weapon systems.""
At least eight people were killed in Monday's explosive drone attacks in Ukraine.
US believes the drones - or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - were transferred from Iran to Russia in violation of a United Nations resolution linked to the Iran nuclear deal, which bars transfers of certain military technologies. Iran denies supplying the drones to Moscow.
After the attacks Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the country would request air defence systems from Israel ""without delay"". 
""Now that Iran has effectively become an accomplice in the crime of aggression against Ukraine, I think that if there is anyone in Israel who is still unsure about whether or not to help Ukraine, this hesitation should now dissipate,"" he said. 
""The same drones that are destroying Ukraine today are also aimed at Israel,"" he added.
Monday's UAV strikes followed a growing number of Russian missile attacks against Ukrainian cities. 
ue of air defences rose to the top of the agenda at meetings in Brussels last week of Nato defence ministers, who said countering Russian strikes would require a patchwork of systems.
Nato countries have been supplying Ukraine with defensive weapons since the start of the war, while the US and Europe recently pledged to send more advanced systems.
week, Ukraine told Israel it wanted to obtain weapons, including Iron Dome anti-rocket batteries, Barak (or ""Lightning"") 8 systems to defend against ship-launched missiles, Patriot surface-to-air missiles, and the new ""Iron Beam"" anti-rocket laser device.
During a speech to the Israeli parliament in March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pressured lawmakers to help, saying: ""Everybody knows that your missile defence systems are the best.""
Israel's best known air defences are its Iron Dome batteries, jointly developed with the US, which are primarily used to shoot down short-range rockets fired by Palestinian militants. During recent conflicts with militants in Gaza the system has intercepted around 90% of projectiles that crossed into Israeli territory and were headed for populated areas, according to the military. 
But analysts say it would have limited effectiveness in Ukraine, whose land mass is around 30 times that of Israel, and which Russia targets with much longer-range weapons, including cruise missiles. 
Israel's reluctance to be drawn into weapons sales to Ukraine - even amid Iran's reported arming of Russia - stems from the impact it believes the decision could have in the Middle East. 
Israel effectively treats Russia like a neighbouring power with whom it ""walks on eggshells"", according to the Israeli military analyst Alex Fishman. 
Russia has controlled much of the airspace over Israel's northern neighbour Syria since it entered the civil war in 2015 to prop up President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Israel frequently launches air strikes into Syria targeting Iranian proxy fighters and Iranian weapons transfers to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. 
""The Russians are sitting on our borders, in the Golan mountains, in Syria and along the Mediterranean shores, the navies are close all the time. Israel [can't] be in an open conflict with the Russians,"" Mr Fishman told the BBC. 
Israel's military informs Russia ahead of impending air strikes in Syria, involving a hotline officially known as ""the Russian-Israeli joint work group on prevention of dangerous incidents in Syria"".  
Preserving this - what is known in Israel as military ""freedom of action"" in Syria - has been a priority for Israel's security establishment. Its concern, among others, is that aggravating Moscow would lead to further Iranian entrenchment in Syria, and advanced weapons getting to Hezbollah. 
When an Israeli government minister at the weekend called for Israel to help arm Ukraine, the leadership got a flavour of how Moscow might respond. 
""It will destroy the relations between [Russia and Israel],"" said Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin.
Israeli officials did not comment on a media report on Wednesday that claimed Israel had not carried out strikes in Syria for over a month. The report led some to question whether its co-ordination with Moscow had deteriorated.  
Israel was also pressured again by President Zelensky, who last month spoke of his ""shock"" that ""Israel did not provide us with anything. Nothing. Zero.""
Mr Fishman, the military analyst, said Israel's historical ties with both Russia and Ukraine were as much of a consideration as the diplomatic and military constraints. 
""The first priority for Israeli foreign policy is the Jewish community,"" he said.  
Israel has seen an influx of more than a million Jews from the former Soviet Union since its collapse in 1989.
f Ukraine triggered a mass migration of at least one in eight of Russia's remaining Jewish population - by August 20,500 of Russia's estimated total of 165,000 Jews had emigrated to Israel.
Ukraine also has one of the biggest Jewish communities in Europe. An estimated 15,000 Ukrainian refugees are living in Israel, about a third of whom have qualified for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return through having at least one Jewish grandparent.
But the Jewish Agency, which facilitates migration of Jews around the world to Israel, has been under pressure in Moscow. 
In July, Russia's justice ministry accused it of violating privacy laws and said it should be shut down, triggering a diplomatic row between Israel and Russia. 
""If we sell the Ukrainians such a [weapons] system, the first step is the Russians will get rid of the Jewish agency,"" said Mr Fishman. "	/news/world-middle-east-63318659
politics	House of Lords: What is it and what could Labour replace it with?	"House of Lords could be abolished if Labour wins the next election.
Lords chamber is centuries old, and replacing it would represent a huge change to the UK's political system. 
House of Lords is part of the UK Parliament. Also known as the Upper Chamber, it is independent from the House of Commons - where Members of Parliament (MPs) debate and vote on new laws.
Members of the Lords are called ""peers"". Like MPs, they also scrutinise the work of government and recommend changes to proposed legislation.
Unlike MPs, however, peers are not elected. The majority are appointed by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister.
While many peers have worked in politics - including some former MPs - others are experts in areas such as science or the arts.
Most peers stay in the Lords for life - although some decide to retire.
re are currently 785 peers, making the House of Lords the second largest parliamentary chamber in the world. Only China's National People's Congress is bigger. 
Conservatives make up the largest group with 265 peers. There are 173 Labour peers, and 185 Crossbenchers - peers who are not affiliated to a particular party.
Membership of the Lords has increased since 2000, according to the House of Lords Library.
re are three main ways to join:
Most Lords are entitled to a £332 daily allowance for each sitting day attended - although they can choose not to claim.
Some receive a salary - like the Lord Speaker and government ministers. Salaried peers cannot claim the daily allowance.
urrent system is ""undemocratic"" and ""indefensible"", according to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.
Labour says the PM should not have the power to appoint peers, highlighting recent controversial appointments such as businessman Peter Cruddas. 
Instead of the Lords, Labour wants an elected second chamber called the Assembly of the Nations and Regions.  
It could have around 200 members from across the UK. However, the way they would be chosen - and how long they would serve - remains to be decided. 
Sir Keir says the new system could be introduced within the first five years of a Labour government.
Labour will set out further details, including a timeframe, closer to the next election.
Gridlock
Former Cabinet Minister Simon Clarke MP has called the plan ""a terrible idea"".
""Anyone who has looked at the institutionalised gridlock in US politics can see the utter stupidity it would be to create an elected upper house"".
Political gridlock can make it difficult to pass new legislation. In the US, this can happen when control of both houses of Congress is split between Republicans and Democrats, meaning one house can block attempts from the other to introduce new laws.
Loss of expertise
Abolishing the Lords could also result in a loss of expertise, says Jess Sargeant from the Institute for Government think tank.
""An appointments system can bring in experts - like former doctors and supreme court judges. There is some speculation about whether these sorts of people would be willing to stand in an election.""
Undermining the Commons
If the new chamber's members considered themselves more representative of the UK than MPs, there is a risk they may undermine the Commons by blocking new laws, adds Ms Sargeant. "	/news/uk-politics-63864428
health	Suffolk nurse burned in fire proud of bodybuilding debut	"A nurse who was scarred in a fire said she felt ""a million dollars"" after finding the confidence to take part in a bodybuilding competition.
Ashleigh Charlesworth had burns to her face, hands and chest during the incident in Great Cornard, Suffolk in April 2021.
29-year-old was put on a ventilator after she and her cousin were injured when a heater exploded at a pub.
""I felt nervous and scared but I am extremely proud of myself,"" she said.
Ms Charlesworth had always dreamed of taking part in a bodybuilding contest, but put her plans on hold while she recovered from the fire, which happened not long after she had bought a house in Cornard and moved out of her father's house in Colchester.
""Taking part in the show has definitely given me more confidence in myself and my capabilities,"" she said.
""My bikini was inspired by the 'girl on fire' vibe and that's why it went from red into orange. I wanted to encompass it within the show as it's a part of me,"" she said.
Bodybuilders usually cover themselves in bronze tanning products.
She contacted the bodybuilding federation Physical Culture Association, which runs the contest, to let them know about her scars.
""I felt quite nervous beforehand and was messaging the federation and the tanning and makeup professionals to make sure they were happy to tan and cover my burns.
""I wanted to make them aware I had burns so they weren't shocked when they saw me. They were so good at reassuring me and calming me down and the make-up artist did such an amazing job.
""I was concerned that other competitors would judge me or look at me funny, but what I realised was that it was my own insecurities.
""The girls that knew about the burns were so reassuring to me and helped me right up until stepping on that stage and I feel privileged to have come away with some new friends in the competing world."" 
mpetition at the Bonus Arena in Hull was specifically for people who had never competed before. 
""For me it wasn't about winning or placing, instead it was about taking part and showing how far I've come since the fire,"" she added.
