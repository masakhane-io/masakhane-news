technology	Gamers face price rise on PS5 but not Switch	"Gamers looking to buy a new console face a price rise if they want a Sony PlayStation 5, but not if they choose a Nintendo Switch. 
PS5s will cost an extra £30 in the UK, with EU consoles going up by €50 (£42) and Canadian consoles by CAD $20 (£13).
Sony is increasing its console prices because of inflation, it says, but Nintendo says that despite rising costs, its prices will stay the same.
Meanwhile, PC gamers may soon be able to save money on their hardware.
Jensen Huang, chief executive of tech company Nvidia, said the company had overproduced graphics cards, which have been in short supply in recent years.
""Our strategy is to sell in well below the current sell-through levels in the marketplace to give the channel an opportunity to correct,"" he said, according to the Verge.
uld mean the price of high-end graphics cards, including the RTX 3000 series, and gaming laptops falling.
Despite the increase in cost of the PS5 in many jurisdictions, there will be no price rises in the US.
Piers Harding-Rolls, industry analyst at gaming research firm Ampere Analysis, told the BBC the lack of a price increase in the US was a result of the strength of the dollar.
""Sony is a global entity which is operating I guess more consistently in lots of global markets, so they are impacted by currency exchanges and the strength of the dollar,"" he said.
""And that's why you're seeing price increases in some markets, but not in others - you've got this nuanced approach which is trying to reflect the impact on the costs of goods in relation to those specific markets.""
Jim Ryan, Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive said in a blog post: ""The global economic environment is a challenge that many of you around the world are no doubt experiencing. 
""We're seeing high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends, impacting consumers and creating pressure on many industries."" 
But Mr Harding-Rolls said he did not expect the price increase to put off gaming enthusiasts.
""I think pent-up demand for PS5, even though the availability is not good, means that this price increase won't have a huge impact at all,"" he said. 
""I don't see it changing Sony's outlooks or their sales. I think they're going to sell all the products that they can get into market.""
He added the move could potentially hand an advantage to Microsoft, which makes the Xbox console, ""because it has the cheaper console in the market coupled with Game Pass"".
BBC has approached Microsoft for comment. 
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa told financial newspaper Nikkei: ""In order to offer unique entertainment to a wide range of customers, we want to avoid pricing people out.
""Our competition is the variety of entertainment in the world, and we always think about pricing in terms of the value of the fun we offer."""	/news/technology-62659688
entertainment	Alexei Ratmansky: The challenges of staging Ukrainian ballet during war	"Russian-born choreographer Alexei Ratmansky, who recently staged a production of Giselle in London with The United Ukrainian Ballet, has told the BBC about the challenges of working on it while the war in Ukraine is ongoing. 
""The dancers have families. I have a family in Kyiv. We are all checking the news constantly,"" Ratmansky, who grew up in Ukraine, told the Hardtalk programme's Stephen Sackur.
""You wake up in the morning and you want to know which cities were bombed, how many people were killed, which buildings were destroyed and check that all your loved ones are OK and safe.""
United Ukrainian Ballet is a group of Ukrainian dancers, technicians and creatives who fled their country when Russia invaded and are now based in the Netherlands.
Ratmansky, a former principal dancer with the Ukrainian National Ballet, Royal Winnipeg Ballet and Royal Danish Ballet, was artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 2004 before joining the American Ballet Theatre in 2009 as artist in residence. He was working on a new production with the Bolshoi when the conflict began and he left Russia.

entertainment	National Television Awards: Ant and Dec to miss ceremony after catching Covid	"Ant and Dec have both caught Covid, so will miss the National Television Awards (NTAs) in London on Thursday.
joked on Instagram: ""Sadly it's true... we even get ill together!""
uo have won the best TV presenter prize for the past 20 years, and could now scoop their 21st consecutive award - unless Alison Hammond, Graham Norton or Bradley Walsh can beat them.
remony will be live on ITV from Wembley Arena after being postponed following the death of the Queen.
BBC's EastEnders, ITV's Emmerdale and Netflix's Bridgerton and Heartstopper all have three nominations each. 
will be hosted by The Masked Singer presenter Joel Dommett, with performances from singers Lewis Capaldi and Sam Ryder, who has replaced Robbie Williams as the opening attraction.
Here are some more things to look out for:
ITV's chief executive last month backed Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield after the hosts were accused of jumping the queue for the Queen's lying-in-state.
NTAs are voted for by the public, though, so it has been up to the people to decide whether the pair will keep their crowns as daytime queen and king, after This Morning won the daytime award in 2021 - or whether they'll be dethroned by Loose Women, The Chase or The Repair Shop.
Notably, neither Holly nor Phil are up for best TV presenter this year, as they have been in previous years. But the nominations were announced in August, long before ""queue-gate"".
Ant and Dec, Line of Duty, Corrie and more -  watch the highlights of the National Television Awards 2021
Ant and Dec underlined their status as the nation's favourite TV hosts last year, after their 20th (yes, 20th) consecutive win in the presenting category.
me they didn't win the award was in 2000, to Michael Barrymore. Most of the nominees in this year's rising star category, including Heartstopper's Joe Locke and Kit Connor, were not even born then.
While the duo will be absent through illness on Thursday, the question is whether voters are sick of seeing them win the same award every year.
Geordie double act are also nominated in the entertainment show category for Saturday Night Takeaway and I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, as well as best talent show for Britain's Got Talent - so there's a good chance we may see an acceptance speech made over video call in their PJs at some stage.
uthored documentary category includes heartfelt films chronicling the lives of Kate Garraway and her husband Derek, who has been critically ill with Covid; Julia Bradbury with breast cancer; Paddy and Christine McGuinness alongside their three autistic children; as well as Katie Price and her disabled son Harvey.
final nominee focuses on The Wanted's late singer Tom Parker. Inside My Head, about the music star's brain tumour, was aired in October 2021 - just five months before he died at the age of 33.
Elsewhere, a new category for best expert will see Clarkson's Farm's breakout star Kaleb Cooper, 24, take on 96-year-old broadcasting legend Sir David Attenborough, Money Show Live host Martin Lewis and The Repair Shop's Jay Blades.
A special recognition award will be given to actor and comedy legend Sir Lenny Henry. Previous recent winners have included the Line of Duty team, Sir Michael Palin and David Dimbleby.

politics	Labour MP Ian Byrne reselected as Liverpool West Derby candidate	"An MP who had faced a battle to be chosen to represent Labour at the next election has been reselected as the party's candidate.
Ian Byrne, who has represented Liverpool West Derby since 2019, was announced as the winner of a ballot on Sunday. 
He had had to compete for the seat after losing a series of votes in local constituency branches.
Mr Byrne and the Labour Party have been approached for a comment by the BBC.
MP had faced competition from Liverpool councillor Anthony Lavelle and Lancashire councillor Kimberley Whitehead.
During the contest, he accused Mr Lavelle's supporters of ""intimidation"", a claim which was strongly denied by the councillor's backers.
Mr Byrne was first selected to replace the previous Labour MP Stephen Twigg in early 2019.
At the time, he was a local ward councillor in Everton and was a vocal supporter of then-party leader Jeremy Corbyn.
He is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group of backbench Labour MPs and is a familiar face on match days on Merseyside, collecting donations for the charity he set up, Fans Supporting Foodbanks.
In Parliament, he has campaigned for a right to food to be established in law and for the Hillsborough disaster to be added to the national curriculum.
Ian Byrne is part of the Socialist Campaign Group parliamentary caucus of Labour MPs - made up of MPs on the left of the Labour party. 
Some Labour left-wingers, including supporters of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn, have claimed in recent months they are being frozen out of standing for the party at the next general election as Sir Keir Starmer seeks to remake the party in his own image. 
But a Labour spokesperson previously said that the party's ""due diligence is about weeding out candidates who could cause electoral damage"".
However, the fact Mr Byrne was not automatically selected prompted criticism by Labour's left - including the group Momentum, who said that despite ""a deeply flawed trigger ballot process which broke with basic principles of fairness"", he had ""roared back to victory"".
""also struck a blow... against an out-of-control Starmer machine willing to break Labour's own rules, disregard trade unions and attack its own MPs in the service of their right-wing purge"".

sports	Bellator v Rizin: AJ McKee on his father, being a 'teddy bear' and the Pitbull trilogy	"AJ McKee Jr was about 12 years old when he asked his father what would turn out to be a lifechanging question.
Growing up in California, McKee spent a lot of time with MMA legend Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson and found himself captivated by the former UFC light-heavyweight champion's lifestyle.
""He was a big jokester, a lot like my father - very laid back and a good heart - but you don't wanna see him mad,"" McKee tells BBC Sport.
""We'd sit in a car he'd made into a limo and during camps he'd go into the gym to train while I'd be sat playing video games.
""We'd go to his house and have barbeques, pool parties, and I was like 'Dad, why don't you have this? We need this life. We deserve this.'""
McKee's father Antonio was a successful fighter who ended his career in 2019 with a fine record of 30 wins and six defeats.
Despite his sporting success, he never reached the same level of stardom as Jackson, and this is what confused McKee.
Looking back, McKee points to the difference in fighting style between the athletes.
""Rampage is a knockout artist. It was such a new, fast-growing sport and everyone wants to see the knockouts and the finishes,"" he says. 
""My father was a brute - a very high-evel wrestler - and nobody could stop his takedowns, but at the time that wasn't what people wanted to see.""
McKee says it used to bother his father when he asked why he did not have the same recognition as Jackson, and this is what initially drove him to pursue his own career in the sport.
On Saturday McKee, 27, will headline a cross-promotional event in Japan between Bellator and Rizin, when he faces Roberto de Souza at lightweight.
Former Bellator featherweight champion McKee is arguably the biggest star in the promotion and will be looking to improve his record of 19 wins and one defeat.
""That's where it became kind of personal with me, like 'I'm going to be your revenge in this sport where they have no choice but to recognise our last name in the industry',"" says McKee.
""My dad is my training partner to this day at 52 years old. He's in the gym with me every day so we came up with a style that was entertaining. 
""We know I have the wrestling background, so I can get someone to the ground, but it was trying to implement the striking and give fans the entertainment they needed - the knockouts, the submissions.""
Away from the cage, McKee describes himself as an ""adrenaline junkie"" with a passion for fast cars, shooting and snowboarding, but also a ""big teddy bear, loving and softly spoken"".
His success enables him to embrace aspects of Jackson's life he admired as a youngster, but he takes a more reserved approach, being conscious of the example he sets for his friends and family.
""When you're a provider you take care of your family and everyone around you and you have to be cognitive of your expenses - that's something my dad kind of made me realise early on,"" says McKee.
""He said you can dress a certain way, you can show people with the work you put in this is what they can expect, but if they don't put in the work they can't expect it.""
Following the sole defeat of McKee's career in a rematch with Patricio 'Pitbull' Freire in April when he lost his title, McKee went through a bout of depression.
""When I heard 'unanimous decision', it was like my whole world crumbled in front of me,"" says McKee.
""I wasn't really open to anyone about it, you know? My 16-year-old brother has lived with me for around four years now. I wasn't talking to him about anything but he could tell I was hurt. 
""I was walking through the house and not saying anything, sleeping all day, and I wasn't able to really verbalise it.""
After some self-reflection, McKee opened up to his loved ones and now uses the experience to help others.
""Depression is big right now, post-Covid, and our younger generation took a big impact on their social lives,"" he says.
""My younger cousin and brother have been through it a bit, so going through something like that myself opened my mind up, and being able to express that to other people and let them know you have people there for you, to verbalise it and reach out...
""I know the first step is hard because you feel vulnerable, but I feel that's the key.""
McKee's Bellator rival Freire is fighting in the co-main event on Saturday against Rizin's featherweight champion Kleber Koike.
McKee and Freire have one win each against each other, with McKee winning their first encounter in July last year, and he is targeting a trilogy bout.
""It's only right for his legacy and for my legacy. It's what the fans want and hopefully it's what he wants,"" says McKee. 
""I don't know how he feels about the last fight but I feel the game needs to be settled and see who the best of the best is.
""It's not about the money or the belt any more - it's for the legacy. We can't leave an open door like that."""	/sport/mixed-martial-arts/64110403
business	Cost of living: Inflation hits NI consumer confidence	"Consumer confidence in Northern Ireland fell sharply in the first quarter of 2022 as inflation hit household finances, a Danske Bank survey has suggested.
urvey was carried out in the second half of March with 1,003 people.
More than 40% of people expected their financial position to worsen over the next year. 
Only 18% believe their finances will be in a better position in 12 months.
In comparison a survey conducted in the final quarter of 2021 found at that time only 26% of people expected their financial position to deteriorate in the year ahead.
In terms of spending, 38% of respondents said they expected to spend less on expensive items over the next year, compared with 26% who anticipated spending more.
However, there is a broad expectation that the jobs market recovery will be sustained.
When asked about job security, 13% of people expected to become more secure in their jobs, while 61% expected no change in job security and only 8% thought their job security would worsen.
Danske Bank chief economist Conor Lambe said: ""In Northern Ireland and the wider UK, consumer spending accounts for a considerable proportion of economic activity and is therefore an important driver of economic growth.
""Inflation has already increased sharply and is likely to rise even higher in the months ahead, exerting a further squeeze on consumer spending.""
UK main rate of inflation, the Consumer Price Index, stood at 7% in March but is expected to rise higher when the April statistics are released this week.
Last week, two of Northern Ireland's biggest food companies warned consumers to expect further price rises this year.
Food production inputs like fuel, fertiliser and animal feed have experienced rapid inflation over the last year.
Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan said only about half of that inflation had been passed to consumers.
was echoed by Justin Coleman, director at Moy Park, which is one of Europe's biggest chicken producers.
""I don't think the full force of food inflation has hit retail shelves yet,"" he said. "	/news/uk-northern-ireland-61468186
politics	Penny Mordaunt moves first in race to replace Liz Truss	"Penny Mordaunt has become the first Conservative MP to say they will run to replace Liz Truss as prime minister.
Commons leader said she was standing to ""unite our country"" and win the next general election.
Rishi Sunak is yet to confirm he is standing, but he has already amassed 87 of the 100 endorsements from MPs he would need to take part. 
Boris Johnson has not ruled out a comeback, months after being forced out of No 10 after a Tory revolt.
former prime minister - who is currently out of the country - has 44 MPs backing him. Ms Mordaunt currently trails both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak, with only 21 public supporters.
International Trade Minister James Duddridge, a former parliamentary aide to Mr Johnson, has told the BBC: ""Boris is coming, and he has the momentum and support. He is coming home and is up for it.  
""He is the only election winner we have that has a proven track record in London, on Brexit, and in gaining the mandate we have now.""  
Ms Mordaunt is currently Commons leader and was briefly defence secretary under Theresa May.
49-year-old Portsmouth North MP backed Brexit and has worked hard to build up her profile with party activists, but did not get enough support from MPs to reach the members' ballot last time.
ry party bosses have decided contenders will need 100 nominations from fellow Conservative MPs, a much higher threshold than normal, meaning no more than three MPs will be able to stand.
Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has ruled himself out of the contest, adding he is ""leaning towards"" backing Boris Johnson.
He told reporters Mr Johnson had a ""mandate"" from the 2019 general election and ""could win the next election"".
Mr Sunak has won a high-level endorsement of his own, with former chancellor and home secretary Sajid Javid backing his leadership bid.
ry MP Angela Richardson said on Friday she had signed Mr Sunak's ""nomination papers for Conservative Party leader"". 
Ms Richardson, who has already declared her support for Mr Sunak, described this as a ""positive end to an extraordinary week in Westminster"". 
Earlier this week, the leader of the Commons Penny Mordaunt told MPs the prime minister was not ""under her desk"" hiding when she stood in for Ms Truss at the despatch box. 
It sounded more mischievous than helpful and Ms Mordaunt's own ambition to sit behind the No 10 desk has never been in doubt. 
She is hoping for early momentum by breaking cover first. Rishi Sunak currently has the most publicly declared support among Tory MPs and the former chancellor is expected to announce he's running soon.
will both pitch themselves as unifying candidates. 
With the threshold for nominations set so high, a maximum of three candidates can reach the first ballot on Monday. 
g question heading into the weekend is whether Boris Johnson attempts to boomerang back into Downing Street. 
former prime minister has already got a couple of Cabinet endorsements but other Tory MPs are horrified at the idea of Mr Johnson making a comeback. 
It's a prospect that splits Conservative MPs between delight and despair. The chance of a backroom deal and simple coronation seems to be receding as the rival campaigns fire up.
If Mr Johnson did make a comeback it would be unprecedented in modern British political history, coming three months after he was forced out by his own MPs following a string of scandals.
ry MP Jesse Norman, one of scores of ministers to quit his government over the summer, said bringing him back would be an ""absolutely catastrophic decision"".
And former Conservative leader Lord Hague told Times Radio it ""would be going round in circles"" and ""could become a death spiral"" for the party. 
""I think it's possibly the worst idea I've heard of in the 46 years I've been a member of the Conservative Party,"" he said.
Polling suggests he remains popular with Tory members, but another tilt at the leadership could prove divisive among Tory MPs, some of whom have said they would quit politics if he came back.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has ruled himself out of the race, along with Security Minister Tom Tugendhat and former cabinet minister Michael Gove.
Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman and International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch are thought to be considering bids.
Contenders have until 14:00 BST on Monday to find 100 backers. If three reach the threshold, Conservative MPs will knock out one contender in a ballot on the same day.
MPs will hold an ""indicative"" ballot of the final two, with the winner then decided in an online vote of party members, to finish next Friday."	/news/uk-politics-63348370
business	Switching to green fuel needs same urgency as Covid jab, says energy boss	"UK would be paying ""billions"" of pounds less for its energy, if it had stuck with plans to reduce fossil fuel use, an energy boss has said.
Greg Jackson, chief executive of Octopus energy, told the BBC there should be a concerted push now.
me ""sense of urgency"" should be applied to the switch to green energy, as there was for finding a Covid vaccine, he said.
government said it had delivered a 500% increase in renewables since 2010.
""Without the clean energy we have deployed over the past decade, bills would be even higher today,"" a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said. 
re were already plans to invest further in renewables, BEIS said.
In 2013, the coalition government led by David Cameron made a series of changes, including cutting back support for energy efficiency and later ended subsidies for onshore wind.
""If we hadn't done that, energy bills this year would be billions of pounds lower than they are,"" Mr Jackson told the Big Green Money Show on BBC Radio 5 Live. 
""It's short term behaviour that has left us even more exposed than we need to be.""
Octopus Energy generates electricity from renewable sources, including wind and solar and supplies energy to three million UK customers.
A report earlier this year by energy analysis site Carbon Brief said bills in the UK were nearly £2.5bn higher than they would have been if climate policies had not been scrapped over the past decade.
""We now need to get on with it, and going green will not only help prevent the catastrophic climate change we see already changing weather patterns, but will also drive energy costs down,"" Mr Jackson said.
Mr Jackson said he believed the process of creating new renewables could be speeded up significantly.
use it was the planning, consent and connection to the grid that took several years, while the engineering of a new wind turbine could be done in a year.
""In the pandemic we took that normal fifteen year process for producing and licensing a vaccine and we did it in a year.
""If we were to act with the same sense of urgency, we could let communities who want it have access to cheap energy quickly enough to make a difference,"" he said.
Some customers who have signed up to green energy suppliers have questioned why their bills aren't already lower than the typical bill, when the cost of generating electricity through renewables is lower than using fossil fuels.
But the price of electricity is currently determined for the whole market by the cost of gas because it is the most expensive form of generation.
Mr Jackson said if the UK moved towards a situation where renewables provided the bulk of energy needs and gas was ""a gap filler"", then the link between the gas and electricity prices could be addressed.
However, it would take several years, before increased renewable generation had an impact on prices for consumers, according to energy analyst David Cox.
""It's a bit of a dream,"" he said. ""To increase wind power, which is the only one you could build quickly, is five to 10 years away before you have a significant contribution.
""That's assuming you can get the parts and the steel, and the cost of that is going to go through the roof because of the cost of gas.""
Subsidising energy efficiency measures, such as home insulation, would be a faster way to reduce gas use and bring down bills, Mr Cox said.
Energy prices have become an urgent political issue in the Conservative leadership race.
frontrunner, Liz Truss, has pledged to suspend the green levy on energy bills, which in the past funded investment in renewable energy. On Tuesday she hinted she would look at providing further support to businesses and households with soaring energy costs. 
However, unlike her rival Rishi Sunak, she has ruled out energy rationing. 
Mr Sunak has pledged to scrap VAT on household energy for one year and has promised more money to help with bills.
A BEIS spokesperson said: ""Since 2010, we have delivered a 500% increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid - more than any other government in British history.""
""To build on this progress, the government recent secured an additional 11GW of clean power in July's renewable auction, and we plan to go even further by driving £100billion of private sector investment in clean energy this decade."""	/news/business-62753949

technology	Encouraging self-harm to be criminalised in Online Safety Bill	"uragement of self-harm will be criminalised in an update to the Online Safety Bill, the government has said.
Content that encourages someone to harm themselves will be targeted in a new offence, making it illegal.
government said the changes had been influenced by the case of Molly Russell - the 14-year-old who ended her life in November 2017.
Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said she was strengthening the bill ""to make sure these vile acts are stamped out"". 
""I am determined that the abhorrent trolls encouraging the young and vulnerable to self-harm are brought to justice,"" she said.
Molly Russell, from Harrow in north-west London, took her own life after viewing suicide and self-harm content on Instagram and Pinterest. 
Her father has previously criticised delays to the Online Safety Bill and called for online platforms to stop self-regulating their content. 
At the inquest in September, the coroner concluded the schoolgirl died while suffering from the ""negative effects of online content"". 
In October, Coroner Andrew Walker wrote to social media firms and the government to call for changes, including separate platforms for adults and children. 
Ms Donelan said social media firms could no longer be ""silent bystanders"" and they would face fines for ""allowing this abusive and destructive behaviour to continue"". 
She said the update to the Online Safety Bill would create a new offence, bringing self-harm content in line with communications that encourage suicide - which is already illegal. 
mendment would mean social media platforms would be required to remove self-harm content and any person found to have posted such content would face prosecution. 
More details about the maximum penalty would be published in due course, the government said. 
NSPCC's Richard Collard said it was ""good news"" the government was recognising the dangers of children being exposed to online content promoting self-harm.
But he said a ""culture of compliance and accountability"" from technology firms that have allowed this type of content ""to spread like wild fire"" was needed.
Amanda Stephens, whose son Olly was stabbed to death in Reading in 2021 by teenagers who plotted his killing across numerous social media platforms, called the amendment to the Online Safety Bill ""positive news"".
""Just because something's hard, shouldn't mean that it stops us wanting to push forward,"" said Ms Stephens.
""At the end of the day, our children are losing their lives; we're losing them from our lives. It's wrong - and we need to, as quickly as possible, but in the best possible way - move forward and I can't stress how strongly I feel about this.""
ue to return to Parliament in early December, following a number of delays. 
gital department said it could not say when the amendments would be tabled. 
Earlier this week the government announced other new offences being added to the bill that would crack down on the sharing of intimate images without consent. 
Representatives from both Pinterest and Meta, Instagram's parent company, gave evidence during Molly Russell's inquest. 
Meta executive Elizabeth Lagone said she believed posts seen by Molly, which her family say ""encourage"" suicide, were safe, but the firm agreed that regulation was needed. 
Judson Hoffman of Pinterest told the inquest the site was ""not safe"" when the school girl was using it. The company said it was ""committed"" to making ongoing improvements to help ensure the platform is ""safe for everyone"". 
Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said ""lives and families"" had been destroyed by ""those who encourage vulnerable internet users to self-harm"".
""Our changes will ensure the full force of the law applies to those callous and reckless individuals who try to manipulate the vulnerable online in this way,"" Mr Raab said.
measure should come as no real surprise - it was proposed by a parliamentary committee in December 2021.  
And there are obvious questions about how effective it will be. Are police going to prosecute a distressed child for posting pictures of their own self-harm scars? Does this clause weigh the law disproportionately against the individual rather than the platforms?
Might this particular clause have helped Molly? It's hard to know. Coroner Andrew Walker concluded that Molly was likely affected by the dark and depressing content and that some posts ""romanticised"" acts of self-harm.
Molly Rose Foundation - set up in her memory - today said it ""appears a significant move"".
But I spoke to Molly's father Ian last week about the progress of the Online Safety Bill. He said years of campaigning ""have led me to not believe in anyone's words but instead judge them by their actions, because it's only when a positive step is taken will I believe it"".
It would have been Molly's birthday today. She would have been 20 years old."	/news/uk-63768496

National Grid ESO previously told the BBC the service is ""not about energy rationing"", despite fears over supplies, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine affecting oil and gas supplies to Europe.
usehold energy bill is forecast to reach £3,553 a year in October.
when the price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - goes up again. It has been forecast to rise further to £4,650 in January.
Jack Beckwith, 25 and from County Durham, said the scheme would mean he is able to put his heating on this winter. 
He expects his bill to go up to £238 per month in October - from his current monthly average of £100 - wiping out his savings. 
""I generally keep on top of my usage and pay for what I use. I have some savings - but that was meant for emergencies - my leaky roof fund. That'll all go towards paying for the price increase,"" he told the BBC. 
""It's been a gradual realisation that I can't afford it.""
Jack said he was expecting to not meet up with friends, and has already said no to taking on a gym membership. He is also considering cutting back on his Spotify subscription, which could save around £10 per month.
""Off peak heating will be a lifeline,"" he said. ""It will literally will save lives if people can be made aware of it, and can use it, because it will mean they can put the heating on.""
National Grid ESO has hosted webinars with energy firms to ask for feedback on its proposals.

health	Patients have to leave Dumfries and Galloway to find NHS dentist	"A health board has said thousands of people will have to leave its area to try to find an NHS dentist.
It comes after a dental practice in Dumfries confirmed plans to deregister more than 5,000 patients.
No other dentists in Dumfries and Galloway are accepting new NHS registrations, meaning they will have to go private or go elsewhere.
Director of public health Valerie White said the situation was one of ""significant concern"".
Blue Door dental practice is the latest in a string of similar issues across south-west Scotland.
Last month, a practice in Thornhill wrote to patients telling them it no longer intended to provide NHS services.
Similar steps were announced in Castle Douglas in October.
rd confirmed that the alternatives facing patients without an NHS dentist were now to ""secure registration outwith the region or access dental care privately"".
Paul Davies is among those affected by the decision of the Blue Door practice in Dumfries to deregister thousands of patients in March next year.
He has been trying to get an appointment since the summer - one was cancelled due to the Queen's funeral and another a week before he was due to be seen.
""In frustration I emailed the practice manager and was told that all NHS appointments were being cancelled as the practice was leaving the NHS for most treatments,"" he said.
""I have been unable to find a NHS dentist in Dumfries.
""Amazingly the pain I have been experiencing has reduced but I do have a broken tooth and some discomfort.""
He said he hoped not to wait until March to be deregistered.
""I intend to speak to Blue Door about leaving and then find a dentist outside of Dumfries and Galloway,"" he said.
Ms White said:  ""We continue work to encourage and support dentists to provide NHS general dental services and are working closely with Scottish government colleagues on these matters.
""However, lack of dentists coming to work in the region is a key issue, and challenges in dental workforce are being seen across the UK.""
Anyone who is not registered with a dentist and requires emergency dental care can access it by contacting the dental helpline on 0845 602 6417.
A Scottish government statement said: ""We understand that in certain remote and rural areas, NHS dental access is challenging - a historical position exacerbated by Brexit controls, as well as the unique difficulties following the pandemic.
""We have put in place additional recruitment and retention incentives to maximise the opportunities for newly qualified dentists to work in areas such as Dumfries and Galloway.""

sports	Mia Palles-Clark: Rider fulfils 'lifetime goal' with GB call for Veteran European Championships	"Mia Palles-Clark is set to fulfil a ""lifetime goal"" after being picked to represent Great Britain at the Veteran European Showjumping Championships.
49-year-old will be part of a five-member squad in Darmstadt-Kranichstein, Germany, next month.
She will ride Hamantha Fortuna, known as 'Maus', at the Championships, for which over 45s are eligible.
""Many years ago I did ride for England a couple of times - but this is incredible,"" she said.
""I got an email on Friday and I was at a competition. I'd just competed, she'd gone brilliantly, I picked up my phone to have a look, as you do, saw an email and my jaw fell open. 
""I grabbed the nearest friend, showed her and said, 'You can't tell anyone because it's confidential still,' but how exciting is this.""
Palles-Clark is a professional showjumping coach, who has worked with the British Army, and is based at Kentford on the Suffolk-Cambridgeshire border.
""Showjumping is my life - I was brought up into it. I'm a coach, a team manager for ponies, and a very passionate competitor too,"" she told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
""To have that GB flag on your jacket, it really does mean a lot.""
Mischa Irving, James Loffet, Faye Riddington-Smith and Michaele Tomlinson make up the rest of the GB team.
Championships, from 8-11 September, involve team and individual competitions, both won by France in 2021 - but getting there will not be straightforward in the post-Brexit world.
""I work very hard to do what I do and it costs a lot of money, but it's good for the soul - it's an obsession, it's in your blood,"" Palles-Clark added.
""I'll have to move heaven and earth to get to Germany but of course I'm going to do that.
""It's now hugely complicated, way more than it ever was - you even have to pay tax going into and out of France on the value of your animal."""	/sport/equestrian/62663019
entertainment	Louise Fletcher: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest's Nurse Ratched dies aged 88	"Louise Fletcher, who won an Oscar for her unforgettable role as Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, has died aged 88. 
US actress died at her home in the south of France, her agent said. 
While she was best known for her portrayal of Nurse Ratched, Fletcher's career spanned six decades, including TV and film. 
Former colleagues and fans paid tribute to the actress, calling her an ""absolute great"". 
Fletcher was a relative unknown when picked to play Nurse Ratched in 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. She began her acting career in the 50s but paused for more than a decade to raise her children. 
Leading actresses including Angela Lansbury and Ellen Burstyn had all turned down the part. 
Set and filmed in a psychiatric hospital in Oregon in the US,  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was directed by Milos Forman and based on Ken Kesey's 1962 novel of the same name. 
film proved hugely popular, winning a raft of awards and making it into many lists of the greatest American films of all time. 
Central to the film's appeal was Fletcher's cruel and calculating Nurse Ratched, a fearsome symbol of institutional authority who is pitted against the individualism of Jack Nicholson's Randle McMurphy.
American Film Institute put Nurse Ratched behind only The Wicked Witch of the West, Darth Vadar, Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter in its ranking of film's greatest villains. 
Fletcher won an Oscar in 1976 for her role, part of a rare clean sweep that saw the film also bag Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay. 
A child of deaf parents, she thanked them using sign language in her acceptance speech.
While her career never again hit the same heights, Fletcher had a recurring role in the TV show Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and gained Emmy nominations for guest-starring in Picket Fences and Joan of Arcadia, in 1996 and 2004 respectively. 
She married producer Jerry Bick in the 1960s, before getting divorced in 1977. She is survived by two sons, John and Andrew.
Friends and fans shared tributes on social media.
Marlee Matlin, a deaf American actress who worked with Fletcher on Picket Fences, wrote on Twitter that she was a ""brilliant actress"", and highlighted that she was first to use sign language in an Oscar acceptance speech. 
Robert Hewitt Wolfe, a writer for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, said: ""'It was an honour and a pleasure to write for Louise Fletcher, one of the absolute great A blazing talent and a compete class act."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63019250
health	Antrim Area Hospital: Hospital 'unsafe' on Saturday night	"A major incident was declared in the Northern Health Trust at the weekend because the situation was ""unsafe,"" the chief executive of the trust has said.
Jennifer Welsh was speaking after people were told not to come to Antrim Area Hospital on Saturday night ""in any circumstances"".
A major incident means there are too many patients for staff to deal with safely. 
was taken after the emergency department reached capacity. 
""At the time we called the incident there were 131 patients and about 66 had a decision to admit and no bed available,"" Ms Welsh told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.
""It's not just a numbers game but is about the acuity of the patients and how sick they are,"" she said.
""Our resuscitation unit was over full,"" she added.
""We simply could not cope. It was safest thing to do to close the door and convey people to next nearest ED [emergency department] to make sure they begin the urgent treatment they need.
""It was the right call to say it was unsafe - it was at the time.""
A social media post from the hospital said the hospital was still under ""extreme pressure"" on Sunday.
On Monday night, the Department of Health said it remained deeply concerned about the situation in hospitals and across the health and social care system.
""The fundamental reality is that we have a serious mismatch between demand for care and the capacity of the system to provide it,"" the department said.
""Hospitals do not have unlimited capacity and it is imperative that when patients have been deemed medically fit, they leave the hospital setting.""
It's a very brave decision, particularly in Northern Ireland, to declare a major incident.
Over the years we have had a culture where it's been seen as a failure when a chief executive comes out and says they can no longer cope - but when you think about it, being unsafe in a hospital is a contradiction.
I have been told that the emergency department at the Royal Belfast Hospital was in a similar position.
I spoke to a number of staff at the weekend and was told there was serious overcrowding in Belfast and in one person's words ""alarming levels of patient congestion"".
Staff said it felt like a very unsafe environment for both patients and staff. 
felt compromised in being able to deliver care in an emergency environment.
On Sunday morning there were 116 people waiting in the ED, figures similar to Antrim, and 61 people waiting to be admitted.
Staff in Belfast were saying they felt they had to keep their doors open because Antrim got in first.
We heard there was a third trust also experiencing a lot of pressure so it's not an isolated incident and the question is, what happens next?
On Monday evening, the South Eastern Trust warned its emergency department at the Ulster Hospital was under ""extreme pressure"".
rust said 164 patients were in the emergency department, 53 awaiting admission.
It issued an appeal for nursing staff to help across critical areas on Monday night.
Ms Welsh said the situation at Antrim Area Hospital would have been ""unthinkable"" five years ago but now it was ""normal business - and not acceptable"".
""The situation is pressured and not just in Antrim but across many of Northern Ireland's emergency departments,"" she said. 
She said new beds were coming in February.
Ms Welsh said Antrim Area Hospital had its highest number of attendances last month.
She added that the Northern Trust was Northern Ireland's largest health trust area geographically and had the highest number of people over 75 - two things that drive hospital admission.
Rita Devlin, from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), told Good Morning Ulster her members were at maximum capacity.
She said the threshold for a major incident was when when a hospital could no longer cope with the amount of patients in its emergency department and there was no possibility of getting patients out of the department.
""We have had times before where the trusts have asked for ambulance diverts but never in my time have I ever heard a hospital tell patients not to come under any circumstances,"" Ms Devlin said.
""I have been contacted by members from three different trusts about overcrowding and unsafe issues for patients, and nurses telling me they can't go on.""
She said the situation should be ringing ""alarm bells for everyone in Northern Ireland"".
She added that health needed ""fundamental transformation,"" which was impossible without ""political leadership"".
Dr Paul Kerr, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine Northern Ireland, warned that one hospital closing its doors put pressure on other hospitals.
""The domino effect occurs in the situation where one hospital says it has to close its doors and the next hospital is going to get more patients and they're going to face a critical incident,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.
""It's a very small system and we have to try and avoid this situation happening because that is going to put us all at risk of being in the same situation.""
Declaring a major incident is rare and under such circumstances, there is a call-out for staff to come into work. 
A potential major incident was declared at Antrim Area Hospital in February but was stood down after several hours.
On Sunday the Belfast Trust appealed to any available nursing staff for help during the nightshift."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63620959
health	Frenchay rehab facility unbuilt seven years after NHS pledge	"Campaigners who fought to stop the closure of Frenchay hospital said the NHS had not fulfilled its pledge to build a health facility on site.
Plans for a replacement community hospital were dropped in 2013.
It was decided instead to build a rehabilitation unit on site but no visible progress has taken place.
Integrated Care Board (ICB) said it remained ""committed to our plans for new rehabilitation facilities on the Frenchay site"".
Southmead Hospital is under severe pressure, as many are across the country, and a third of beds are currently blocked by patients fit for discharge.
Campaigners said given the need to relieve pressure, they could not understand why a rehabilitation centre with in-patient beds was such a long way off.
Campaigner Barbara Harris has been pushing for the unit to be built for years.
She said: ""All we're left with is a minor injuries unit, and an 800-bed acute hospital that has 300 bed blockers in it.""
""Small wonder that ambulances are queuing,"" she added.
Another campaigner, Daphne Havercroft, said there was a lack of scrutiny by South Gloucestershire Council: "" It has not come under Health Scrutiny (Committee) since January  2020.""
She added: ""If the councillors aren't taking an interest, what message is that sending to local people?""
A spokesperson for South Gloucestershire Council said: ""We are committed to working closely with our partners at North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT) and the NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire ICB around the future development of rehabilitation and extra care facilities at Frenchay and improving health and care provision across the whole of South Gloucestershire is a priority for the council.""
w ICB that runs services in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire said the facility was also very much in its plans, although no construction date has been given for it.
It would be part of a broader scheme to increase community rehabilitation, allowing more people to leave hospital earlier. 
An ICB statement said: ""Reducing delayed discharges from hospital remains a high priority for our system and we are continuing to invest in measures to improve discharge processes, reduce length of stay, and ensure that everyone can move on from hospital once they are medically well enough to do so.""

politics	Covid public inquiry promises to cover key Welsh issues	"UK Covid public inquiry will do all it can to ensure all issues the people of Wales want covered are investigated, its chair has said.
Baroness Hallett made the pledge as it was revealed the inquiry will hold public hearings in Wales next autumn.
She said she understood the ""strength of feelings"" on calls for a separate Wales inquiry but that she was ""completely neutral on the question"".
Baroness Hallett was speaking at a preliminary hearing in London.
Opening the session, to discuss the section of the inquiry that will consider how to investigate Welsh decision-making during the pandemic, she said: ""I know there have been calls for a separate Welsh inquiry, and I understand the strength of feeling that there is around both Wales and Northern Ireland asking for separate inquiries.
""It's not a decision for me, and I'm completely neutral on the question, but what I will promise you is that if a Wales inquiry is set up I will work with them and co-operate to the best of my ability to ensure that between us we cover all of the issues that the people of Wales would wish to see covered. 
""If there isn't a separate inquiry established then I will do my very best to ensure that we again cover all the issues the people in Wales wish to see covered.""
Baroness Hallett said that, from a consultation exercise visit to Cardiff she had made, ""I know the strength of feeling there are on a number of different issues because I heard them directly from members of bereaved families"".
Counsel for the inquiry Tom Poole KC added that the ""people of Wales are entitled to have the Welsh government's key decision-making in response to the pandemic fully scrutinised, and their experiences and their voices properly heard and represented"". 
""Only in this way,"" he said, ""can proper and effective recommendations be drawn up to better protect Wales in the future, from pandemics and other comparable civil emergencies.""
Speaking on behalf of the Welsh government, Christian J Howells promised the inquiry ""the fullest possible co-operation in investigating the response to the unprecedented challenges faced by the people of Wales, their communities, their businesses and their public services as a result of the pandemic"". 
Mr Howells said the inquiry was ""the best means by which the interconnected decision-making between the UK government and devolved governments can be properly explored"". 
""In particular, this inquiry can look at how distinct decisions were made by each of the four nations for their respective countries either on a four nations basis or separately. 
""We have been consistent in our determination that our actions and those of our public sector partners in Wales are fully and properly scrutinised as part of this inquiry. 
""The people of Wales deserve no less, particularly those who have lost loved ones but also everyone else whose lives were affected by this devastating pandemic.""

entertainment	Alec Baldwin reaches settlement over Halyna Hutchins shooting on Rust set	"Alec Baldwin has reached a settlement with the family of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, after she was killed on a film set when he fired a prop gun.
Filming of Rust will continue in January, with Ms Hutchins' widower Matthew on board as the movie's executive producer.
All parties believe Ms Hutchins' death was an accident, her husband said.
A lawsuit filed against Mr Baldwin, producers and others, had alleged violations of industry standards.
xact terms of the settlement, which is subject to court approval, have not been disclosed. 
In a statement, Mr Hutchins said that ""all the original principal players"" would be involved when filming resumes, which he said would be a way to ""pay tribute"" to his late wife's final work. 
""I have no interest in engaging in recriminations or attribution of blame,"" he added.
""All of us believe Halyna's death was a terrible accident.""
Mr Baldwin posted his reaction in a statement on Instagram: ""We are pleased to announce today the settlement of the civil case filed on behalf of the family of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.
""Throughout this difficult process, everyone has maintained the specific desire to do what is best for Halyna's son.

business	From Maruti to Amul: Five brands that shaped India after independence	"Some things just stick, like an iconic ad jingle or the taste of the butter you've grown up eating.
It's what makes consumers fall in love with a brand and stay loyal to it. India has a host of homegrown brands that have found their way into the homes and hearts of millions over the decades.
rands helped India become self-sufficient after the country gained independence in 1947 and, over the years, they have shaped consumer behaviour and transformed their sectors.
Seventy-five years later, they continue to bolster India's marketplace, making it viable for global investors. Here's a look at some of the most illustrious brands and how they shaped India and its people.
Amul's milk products are ubiquitous in India, making the brand a leader in the dairy category and one of India's top 10 fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies.
It started off in the western state of Gujarat as a co-operative movement, by bringing together thousands of farmers to create a thriving dairy business.
Under the leadership of Dr Verghese Kurien - a social entrepreneur credited with kickstarting ""India's milk revolution"" - the brand perfected the grassroots cooperative business model and today offers employment to millions.
Despite facing competition from multinational giants, Amul has managed to hold fort in the dairy space in India - a testament to the brand's ability to adapt and survive.
Amul also made it cool to hold up a mirror to society long before it became fashionable for brands to do so. Their ads featuring the 'Amul girl' have offered a tongue-in-cheek take on almost every significant event in India - be it a political scam or an actor's demise.
rm of Amul - it is India's original social enterprise, and one that has always had the larger collective good at the heart of its design.
A glucose biscuit brand from Parle Products, Parle-G is among the world's largest-selling brands of biscuits in terms of volume and one of the most widely distributed products in India. 
It is also the biscuit that has united India, one bite at a time.
Born out of the Swadeshi movement - a self-sufficiency movement that was part of India's freedom struggle in the early 1900s - the brand was created as a counterpoint to the expensive biscuits sold by the dominant international players at the time.
Parle-G quickly became an integral part of the Indian palate, cementing its place as the inevitable partner to a cup of tea. Apart from its popularity as a product, culturally it is part of one's collective identity. The experience of enjoying a Parle-G biscuit dipped in tea is one that people across class, caste and region can relate to within India.
For a very long time, it was only the privileged few who could afford a car in India and for the middle class, it was a distant dream. Then, Maruti came along and began offering cars at a magical price point of just about 50,000 rupees ($625; £530).
800CC cars were cute, zippy and far more reliable than bulky Ambassadors - India's only luxury car from the 1960s to the mid 1990s.
Maruti whet the appetite of India's consumption-hungry middle class and transformed consumer behaviour in the country. It democratised travel and aspirations, and represented mobility in every sense.
Families discovered that the radius of their reach - geographically and socially - had dramatically increased with the owning of a car. And so Indian society, notorious for being steeped in caution and restraint,  found itself gleefully seeking out the next frontier of consumption - and then the next. 
Up until the 1980s in India, it was legacy brands that held sway over the marketplace. But Nirma, a detergent brand with its origins in Gujarat's Ahmedabad city, took on established players in the space and humbled them.
At a time when businessmen were hesitant to invest money up-front in advertising, Nirma spent huge sums on TV ads. 
Nirma jingle, which drives home the brand's name by repetition, is an earworm that refuses to die even today. In recent years, it has taken on a new life with millennials remixing it and making it part of quirky acapella renditions.
rand's foresight and ambition helped it dominate and leverage the most powerful media vehicle of the time to drive up consumption.
Another admirable strategy of the brand was that it kept a razor-sharp focus on elements that truly mattered - it offered an adequately good product at a great price and relied on a simple, but efficient, distribution model to sell its products.
In this way, Nirma made itself indispensable to millions of Indians who wanted good-quality products at an affordable price.
rand has now become a symbol of an entrepreneurial spirit that is hungry for success and has the confidence to rely on new ways to chart a path in the Indian marketplace.
An offering of Reliance Industries, Jio is among India's biggest telecoms brands.
At the time of its launch in 2016 by Mukesh Ambani, one of Asia's richest men, India's telecoms space was already dominated by other multinational brands.
But Jio turned the tables in its favour by adapting a clever marketing strategy. It offered free data and calls for the first six months, luring millions of customers and transforming India's digital landscape.
ks to Jio, what would have been a gradual process of digital adoption became an accelerated phenomenon.
, India's digital-savvy populace has become a crucial market for global technology players. It has also helped India build a robust digital payment system, which is counted among the finest in the world. The cultural impact of the exposure digital access provides is far too sweeping in nature to be measured.
If there is one drawback, it is that this very digital revolution in India has also contributed to the polarised environment the country finds itself trapped in today.

politics	Delay to free school meal extension 'shameful', EIS union says	"rollout of free school meals to all primary pupils has been branded ""shameful"" by the country's biggest teaching union. 
general secretary of the EIS union, Andrea Bradley, said it ""runs contrary"" to efforts to tackle child poverty.
She also accused the Scottish government of attempting to ""obscure"" the move in its recent budget.
Ministers said Scotland had the ""most generous universal provision"" of free school lunches in the UK.
Scottish government had previously promised to introduce free school meals for all primary school pupils by August 2022.
So far this has only been delivered for youngsters in P1 to P5. 
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in September that the government would ""start work with local authorities to extend universal provision to all pupils in primary 6 and 7"".
But the EIS said details in the Scottish budget showed that the universal rollout of free school meals for P6 and P7 will now be delayed until 2024.
Ms Bradley said: ""Delaying the rollout of free school meals to all primary school children was a shameful decision, which runs contrary to the Scottish government's stated commitment to tackling child poverty.""
She added: ""This is now the second time that the rollout of this hugely important policy has been delayed, with serious consequences for thousands of children and families across Scotland.
""It is also extremely disappointing how this change in policy came to light - not announced in parliament, but obscured within the detail of the budget document itself.
""In a country where more than one child in four lives in poverty, and with the cost-of-living crisis pushing ever more families into financial difficulty, it is more important than ever that universal free school meals should be a priority.""
union chief said that while a ""watered-down, means-tested policy"" on free school meals is being introduced for youngsters in the final two years of primary school, many children could still miss out amid a cost of living crisis. 
She continued: ""Universal free meals remain the best way to ensure that all young people have access to a healthy and nutritious meal at school, without any stigma being attached.""
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said Scotland leads the way in the UK on free school meals. 
""All pupils in Primaries 1 to 5, children in funded early learning and childcare, and eligible pupils in Primary 6 through to S6 benefit from free meals in Scotland - the most generous universal provision of anywhere in the UK,"" she said.
""We will go further. Our additional investment announced in the 2023-24 Budget will continue to fund the expansion of free school meals for all Primary 6 and 7 pupils in receipt of the Scottish Child Payment, helping children most in need first.
""This will be the next step in fulfilling our commitment to universal provision in primary schools.""
Ms Somerville added: ""A number of local authorities have indicated that they face challenges in planning for the substantial expansion of free school meals. It is right that we work in partnership with local government to deliver our shared commitment."" "	/news/uk-scotland-64095765

Dozens of patients are also calling for an external and independent review of what happened to them.
ged a protest to highlight their cause outside Ninewells Hospital. 
Scottish government has turned down calls for a public inquiry.
Prof Eljamel, the former head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside in Dundee, harmed dozens of patients before he was suspended in 2013.
He was allowed to voluntarily remove himself from the General Medical Council's register and is now working as a surgeon in Libya.
Elizabeth Rose from L&M MediLaw said she had been approached by some of Eljamel's patients to look into any harm they experienced under his care, as well as the actions or omissions of Tayside Health Board. 
wyer also backed the patients' calls for a public inquiry.
She said: ""Although our investigations are at very early stages, a public inquiry would allow those affected to understand what happened to them and why.""
Jules Rose was among those protesting outside Ninewells Hospital.
After her operation in 2013, Ms Rose discovered that Prof Eljamel had removed her tear gland instead of a tumour on her brain.
She still has not been told exactly when health bosses knew he was a risk to patients.
Ms Rose said that a class action, or group proceeding as it is known in Scotland, was being considered.
However, she said that a public inquiry was the patients' priority.
She said: ""Patients have been complaining to NHS Tayside for years and they have got nowhere.
""They have got every door closed in their face. 
""Why was Tayside allowing the surgeon to continue butchering people for so many years, what were they doing?
""Where were their systems and processes?
""All these questions need answered by external scrutiny.""
An NHS Tayside spokeswoman said the health board was aware of the protest.
She added: ""We continue to be in contact directly with Ms Rose and have offered her another meeting with the Chair, Chief Executive and Medical Director. 
""Ms Rose has advised that she welcomes this further opportunity for discussion.  
""We are also making arrangements for other patients who wish to discuss their circumstances to be invited to a meeting."" "	/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-63877241
sports	Ukrainians resume badminton training in Ipswich	"A group of elite badminton players from Ukraine are receiving regular coaching after being given refuge in Suffolk. 
Eight youngsters have been found host families in Ipswich, in a scheme organised by coach Helen Thornton and Badminton England.
It means they can attend sessions at the town's Badminton Performance Centre at sixth form college Suffolk One.
""It's absolutely everything to all the people who are here - it's a huge sport for them,"" said Ms Thornton.
""There are two things they wanted to be - one, was to be safe and two, to be somewhere they could play badminton.
""That was their second requirement over and above school, and having a nice home.""
Yana, 17, and her elder sister, Yuliia, from the central Ukrainian city Dnipro, initially fled to Poland, and have lived with Alex and Jane Gooch since May.

""I'm really happy to be playing badminton again because I can't tell you how much I love the sport,"" she added.
""It helps me to think about something else - not the war, the news - I can concentrate on my training.""
Ms Thornton added the integration over the past few weeks has been ""incredible"".
""The kids are so involved and [playing badminton] gives them some sense of normality,"" she said.
""As soon as they walk in the hall they've got a smile on their face, and they work really hard.
""It also raises the level here, because the kids are really good players.""

politics	Earl of Shrewsbury faces suspension from Lords over lobbying claims	"A hereditary peer is facing suspension from the House of Lords for breaking lobbying rules. 
Earl of Shrewsbury was found by the Lords Conduct Committee to have approached ministers on behalf of a company marketing Covid-19 sanitiser products, which he worked for. 
mmittee recommended he should be suspended for nine months, which is subject to a vote by the upper house.
Lord Shrewsbury has said he did not realise his actions broke the rules.
Earl of Shrewsbury is one of the few remaining hereditary peers in the Lords and was affiliated with the Conservatives until October but now sits as a non-party crossbench peer.
He was paid £57,000 by healthcare company SpectrumX for his work as a consultant over a period of 19 months between 2020 and 2022. 
In 2020, at the height of the Covid pandemic, the firm was seeking regulatory approval for products including hand sanitisers and a walk-in disinfectant tunnel.
r approached ministers, including then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock to promote the company's tunnel in return for a £3,000 monthly retainer, the committee's report found. 
He referred himself to the commissioner following allegations about his conduct in relation to the company in the Sunday Times. 
Lord Shrewsbury has argued his work for SpectrumX was ""openly commercial dealing"", that he declared his interest as an adviser to the company and never sought to ""influence policy"". 
mmittee accepted that he did not act with ""deliberate dishonesty"" and did not realise his actions broke the rules. 
However, it found ""clear"" breaches of the Lords' code of conduct by seeking ""to profit from membership of the House"" and providing parliamentary advice or exercising parliamentary influence in return for payment. 
Separately, Baroness Goudie was also found to have breached the code ""by agreeing to provide parliamentary advice in return for payment"" and for breaking rules on the use of the House's facilities. 
mmittee has recommended she is suspended from the Lords for six months and Labour has also suspended her from the parliamentary party. 
reaches relate to her work for ecoLegacy in 2016 and 2017.
She was paid €20,000 (£17,454) over a 10-month period as an adviser for the company. the Lords committee said in its report. 
As part of her role, she advised the company on who to approach about their work and offered to book a room on the estate to hold meetings, although ultimately no room was reserved and Baroness Goudie did not directly approach parliamentarians on the company's behalf. 
She also commissioned research by the Lords Library on behalf of the company, in breach of the code. 
r has acknowledged she had an interest in the company during the period and has apologised for failing to register that interest until April 2017. 
However, the committee said she refused to accept her conduct had breached any other aspect of the code. 
In response to the report, Baroness Goudie said: ""Six-and-a-half years after the alleged events, I was accused by a former colleague of 'paid advocacy' and a late declaration of my interests.
""I totally refute the first allegation on which the commissioner made no finding and sincerely apologise for my late declaration in 2016, before which time I had used the Lords Library on one occasion to check facts relevant to my interests.""
upper chamber is due to vote on whether to approve the recommendations next month. "	/news/uk-politics-63998059
health	Queen Elizabeth University Hospital records worst A&E waiting times	"Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital has recorded the worst A&E waiting time figures on record, with almost two-thirds of patients waiting more than four hours to be seen.
Across Scotland emergency department waiting times for the week ending 20 November were the second worst since the recording system began in 2015. 
Just 63.1% of patients were dealt with in the four-hour target time. 
Some 9,390 patients waited more than the four-hour to be attended to. 
Public Health Scotland stats show 3,013 patients spent more than eight hours in A&E while 1,062 waited more than 12 hours.
Performance varied across Scotland's hospitals with some, such as Western Isles and Lorn and Islands in Oban, meeting the Scottish government target which aims to admit, transfer or discharge 95% of patients within four hours.
Other larger hospitals such as Perth Royal Infirmary (92.9%) and Dundee Ninewells (89.5%) also performed well against the target.
But five managed to deal with fewer than half of their A&E patients within four hours, including Forth Valley Royal (47.8%), Aberdeen Royal (46.8%), Hairmyres in East Kilbride (43%), and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (41.3%), Scotland busiest A&E department.
QEUH in Glasgow, the second busiest A&E in Scotland, only managed to see 35.1% of patients within four hours, with 1,179 waiting longer than the target.
It was the worst performance by any hospital since weekly recording began seven years ago.
revious lows were recorded by Forth Valley Royal in September and October this year.
A statement from the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board said the hospital was facing significant pressures including challenges throughout the whole hospital which had an impact A&E.
It said a recruitment campaign was ongoing and was working on new ways to treat patients, including virtual A&E care.
It added: ""Concurrently, we continue to urge any patient who thinks they need emergency care, but it's not life-threatening, to use alternatives to A&E such as local pharmacies, GPs, NHS Inform and the virtual A&E service, which is accessible through NHS24 on 111. 
""These routes mean patients will be seen and treated faster than at A&E and helps ring-fence A&E for those with life-threatening injuries and illnesses.""
Responding to the figures, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""Covid continues to impact the performance of services and pandemic backlogs, Brexit-driven staff shortages, and inflation costs have all contributed to make this winter the most challenging the NHS has ever faced.
""Despite this, I am clear that A&E performance is not where it needs to be.""
Mr Yousaf said delayed discharge continued to be the single biggest factor driving up A&E waits and he was working to ensure people were leaving hospital without delay, freeing up beds for those who need them.
Scottish Tory heath spokesman Sandesh Gulhane said: ""These figures show our NHS is heading for a truly terrifying winter on Humza Yousaf's watch.
""More and more lives are being put on the line every single week in A&E under this health secretary. We are still yet to hit December, yet he's presided over yet another deplorable set of stats.""
Dr Gulhane said the QEUH figures were ""especially horrendous"", adding that the data was ""completely unacceptable and incredibly alarming for the safety of patients and staff at the hospital"".
Scottish Labour Health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: ""These figures paint a grim picture of the continual crisis that is facing patients and staff in A&Es across our country.
""Clearly, things aren't improving despite repeated promises from the SNP that they will get a handle on this chaos.""
She added: ""The abysmal figures reported from the QEUH show the intense pressure facing our hospitals, and things are only getting worse."" "	/news/uk-scotland-63793352
technology	Apple reveals iPhone 14 Pro and Watch Ultra	"Apple has unveiled the iPhone 14, with emergency satellite connectivity and car crash detection technology, at a launch event in the US. 
mpany revealed four versions of the new handset at its Cupertino headquarters, with an audience attending in person for the first time since the pandemic.
It also showed off a new extreme sports wearable - the Watch Ultra.

Apple CEO Tim Cook was on stage at the Steve Jobs theatre inside the tech giant's California campus - but the presentation itself was entirely pre-recorded.
Apple reveals iPhone 14 Pro and Watch Ultra
Apple Watch Series 8 has a number of new features, including car crash detection, temperature sensors for tracking ovulation cycles and a new low-power mode option.
People have been cautious about menstrual trackers since changes were made to abortion legislation in the US and there are concerns that data about periods could be used by law enforcement. Apple says the data on its devices will be encrypted and only accessible via a passcode or biometrics. 
""We are taking our commitment to women's health even further,"" said Jeff Williams, chief operating officer at Apple.
Apple said a new automatic retrospective ovulation notification could help those who are trying to conceive. 
If activated, the new watch can monitor body temperate every five seconds overnight, and detect tiny changes which can signal ovulation. 
Another new feature is car crash detection. Using sensors, the watch will be able to identify a severe crash and will automatically connect its wearer with emergency services, provide their exact location and notify emergency contacts. 
Series 8 now also features a low power mode, a feature borrowed from the iPhone, that promises up to 36 hours of battery life on a full charge.
Apple Watch Series 8 is priced from $399 in the US, £419 in the UK.
Swim-proof, dust-proof and crack-resistant - Apple has announced its rival to the likes of Garmin, Polar and other rugged watchmakers. 
Ultramarathoner Scott Jurek from Born to Run appeared in the presentation for the new watch, which focused on a larger face design for extreme sports use.
All Ultra watches have up to 36 hours battery life on a single charge and an extended battery life of 60 hours, with Apple promising enough power for its customers to complete an ultra-triathlon which includes swimming, cycling and running. 
Apple Watch Ultra is priced from $799 in the US, £849 in the UK.
mpany is releasing the iPhone 14 in two sizes, the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus.
w handsets are capable of sending an emergency call for help via satellite. The phone will display the whereabouts of passing satellites overhead and demonstrate how to point the device at them correctly. 
It can take from 15 seconds to a few minutes to send a basic message.
""The investment to add satellite capability should not be underestimated,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. 
""It will likely have taken Apple years to put all the pieces of the puzzle in place, including a commercial agreement with satellite provider Globalstar, and the creation of the infrastructure needed to pass messages to the emergency services.""
Paolo Pescatore said he believed the innovation was good news for consumers ""in hard-to-reach areas"". 
""It is encouraging to see providers starting to get serious about using satellite - ultimately reliable and robust connectivity is still highly sought-after among all users,"" he said.

Being here in person, among an enthusiastic crowd of Apple fans, certainly made for a more interesting launch than recent years. But nothing was announced today that is going to revolutionise the tech industry.
Much of Apple's new tech seems ideal if you find yourself in some kind of peril on a regular basis.  The new iPhone 14 will be able to send texts by satellite when off the grid. The Ultra Watch design is chunky with extra-long battery life - the company says this is perfect for multi-day remote trips. Apple also announced a new crash detection system on new watches and phones, which will alert the emergency services when it detects an impact. The strategy here is pretty clear. Apple is continuing to pitch its hardware as a health and safety aid. Not surprisingly, Tim Cook describes the products as ""essential"".
But in reality these are interesting but fairly niche updates - features that users will hope they will never have to use."	/news/technology-62827774
technology	After the hype plant-based proteins face leaner times	"London's Vegfest this year was notably smaller and more subdued than in previous years, when queues would snake around the venue.
It's still the UK's largest indoor vegan event and this year's was the first one since the Covid-19 pandemic started.
rising price of food was one frequent topic of conversation. Like many parts of the world, grocery price inflation in the UK is very high, at 14.7% as of the end of October 2022. 
In response, a back-to-basics movement is underway among UK vegans. They're cooking more pulses and grains, buying in bulk, and relying less on the exotic processed products that have proliferated on supermarket shelves in the past few years. 
""The cost-of-living crisis in the UK has a big impact on food purchasing decisions,"" explains Louisianna Waring, the senior insight and policy officer for the Vegan Society.
So, if vegans are thinking more carefully about how they spend money, where does this leave companies with innovative plant-based proteins?
For a while in 2019 and 2020 it seemed like every month brought a plant-based meat, dairy or even fish alternative. The newcomers were trying to appeal to vegans and to non-vegans who were looking to cut down on animal protein.
But the evidence suggests that interest in the new foodstuffs has declined. Market research firm IRI has found that sales of plant-based meat products fell sharply in the US earlier this year.
ustry is partly the victim of its own success says Tom Rees, an industry manager at the market research firm Euromonitor.
He argues that as meat alternatives proliferated in the US during the pandemic, many people tried the lower-quality products and had bad experiences. 
So while wanting a healthier lifestyle might bring the veg-curious to vegan shelves, taste is often what drives them away, Mr Rees says.
Beyond Meat, was one of the brightest starts of the alternative meat sector. But in its most recent quarter it recorded a loss of almost $15m (£12.4m), and a 23% decline in sales compared with the same period in the previous year.
Beyond Meat's share price collapsed to a low of $11.56 in November 2022, a 95% fall from its record high of almost $240 in July 2019.
It expects further losses, and is aiming to recover by lowering prices.
But although these figures are concerning, we shouldn't place too much emphasis on them, cautions Friederike Grosse-Holz, a plant scientist who is currently a scientific director at Blue Horizon, an investment firm focused on sustainable food.
""Some people might have hyped this [sector] more than made sense from a business perspective,"" she acknowledges. 
But she says what we're seeing now isn't a catastrophic decline for plant-based foods, but what she calls a ""return to normal"". 
""I think it is really coming from a hype to a healthy growth trajectory, rather than a hype to death,"" she says.
Ms Waring agrees. ""In the last few years we have seen some vegan product categories in the UK see double, and even triple-digit, growth,"" she notes. ""This huge boom was always likely to lead to a slight decline in sales where the market stabilises, innovates, and then increases again.""
Another reason for caution in interpreting the data is that sales of meat are down as well. A September 2022 survey of UK adults by the consultancy Public First found that 28% were buying less meat in response to the soaring cost of living.
Despite the downturn in meat alternatives in the US, plant-based dairy sales remain high. Yet in this sector as well, consumers are increasingly scrutinising health claims. Many people no longer automatically assume that vegan equals nutritious.
More technology of business:
In one bright spot for alternative proteins, Ms Grosse-Holz believes that they are well positioned for resilience amid ongoing supply chain issues. They often have shorter supply chains than animal agriculture, as they don't need to rely on the animal feed step.
're not completely insulated from world events, of course. For German manufacturers of alternative meats, certain key ingredients remain in short supply following the Russian invasion in Ukraine. 
Retailers are also feeling the pinch, in the face of high energy prices and inflation. The Vegan Kind, the UK's biggest online supermarket dedicated to plant-based products, announced in November that it was ceasing operations, citing the challenging economic climate.
Overall, however, plant-based producers are heavily pushing to scale up production and drive down costs, in response to consumer demand. 
Developing technologies are helping with that. For instance, producers of plant-based chicken have often used pea protein isolate, for its ease in extrusion - essentially, forcing ingredients through a small opening. 
But improvements in extrusion technology mean that more companies are now able to use pea flour instead, which results in cost savings. It also translates into a food label that many consumers find more relatable.
""There is a bunch of magic happening on the product formulation side,"" Ms Grosse-Holz says.
But, as she emphasises, communication remains key: ""It doesn't help anyone if you have the greatest technological solution to the problem, if people are not going to buy it."""	/news/business-63718772
entertainment	Award launched to honour actress Phoebe Frances Brown	"'I made sense of my cancer by creating some art'
wo theatres are launching a writing award to celebrate the memory of an actress who died at the age of 29.

""Her positivity shone out of her and will continue to do so throughout this award. I am beyond proud.""
When interviewed by the BBC in 2021, Miss Frances Brown said she had started writing the play while in hospital.
""I was writing more for myself because I was just making sense of it all,"" she said.
She was born in Nottingham and trained at the city's Television Workshop, a charity known for developing stars including Vicky McClure and Jack O'Connell.
She then studied at the University of Birmingham, where she received a first class degree.
