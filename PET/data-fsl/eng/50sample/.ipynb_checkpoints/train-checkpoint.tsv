health	Wales NHS: Unprecedented health pressure, says top doctor	"Hospitals in Wales are in an unprecedented situation as they tackle flu, according to the country's top doctor.
Dr Sir Frank Atherton said all health boards were ""at the highest level of escalation"" and described the system as the busiest he had seen.
ressures meant staff felt ""wiped out"" and ""destroyed"" at the end of their shifts with many left in tears, according to one consultant. 
It comes as flu cases are rising.
For the week from 19-25 December, there were 1,877 cases recorded by Public Health Wales, with 369 of these leading to hospital treatment.
week before, the figure was 236 leading to hospital admissions, and it was 53 a month before.
""Traditionally people have called 111, but even that is under significant pressure,"" Dr Atherton said.
""We have had double the number of calls in a week compared to the same time last year.""
He said a 111 website had been set up to ease pressure, where people could get advice.
""The health and care system is under such pressure, it's the busiest I've ever seen it,"" he added.
""The new year is always the busiest time, but we are going into it with all of our health boards at the highest level of escalation.
""And that is an unprecedented situation, so we are encouraging people to find other ways to manage more minor conditions.""
Health boards have asked people not to make hospital visits if they have flu-like symptoms, to protect patients.
Figures showed there were 527 patients with flu in hospital beds in Wales in the week leading up to Christmas, a 58% jump on the week before. 
Of these patients, 29 were in critical care.
Nearly half of patients in hospital with flu were over 80, while nearly three-quarters of patients had caught flu while in hospital.
Of the 369 admissions with flu in the latest week, more than half were over 60 and nearly a quarter were children.
Dr Atherton said flu was on the ""rise in all four nations"" of the UK. 
""People who are frail and elderly will be badly affected and will need hospital services and that's what we are seeing here and that's added to the pressures that's coming from everything else,"" he said
""It's a bad season. It's on the rise because we haven't seen much flu and we haven't seen any of the respiratory diseases for the past few years because of the measures around coronavirus such as lockdowns and masks that led to far less circulation, but they're bouncing back and that's what is happening this year.""
He urged those eligible or who have a respiratory disease to get a flu jab and others not to ""go mixing with your granny if you have a cold or anyone particularly vulnerable"".
Masks are no longer compulsory in hospital, but Dr Atherton said they were still advised. 
An A&E consultant at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, said many of his colleagues felt ""wiped out"" and ""destroyed"" at the end of their shifts, due to current pressures.
Andy MacNab said his department was currently overcrowded and ""it was hard to deliver the quality of care they would like"" to patients, with many staff ""in tears"" during and after their shifts.
""Coming into work knowing you are going to have a really bad day even before you get there is really hard,"" he said.
Mr MacNab said Christmas Day had been particularly busy this year and staff had ""struggled ever since"" with keeping waiting times down.
He said some people had been waiting for 18 hours to be seen, adding: ""At the moment I've got 60 people waiting for beds in the emergency department and we have got 27 trolleys in total, so that means we have got people doubled up, it means we have got people stuck in ambulances outside, and most crucially we have got very little space to see new arrivals, so we have to prioritise people who are really, really sick.""
Wales Ambulance Service warned people to act responsibly to avoid adding extra pressure.
Mark Harris, assistant director of operations, said Christmas was ""very, very busy,"" with a 60% increase in calls to life-threatening incidents and double the number to the 111 service from last year.
He told BBC Radio Wales Drive: ""New Year's Eve is always busy. We expecting it to be similarly busy if not busier, so we're just asking people to help us by taking a few actions just to keep themselves and other safe over the next few days"".
Mr Harris urged people to drink moderately, and make sure they ate before they start mixing alcohol and soft drinks. 
He also asked revellers to avoid using fireworks, arrange transport home in advance, never drink-drive or drug-drive, and ensure they were stocked up on prescription medications.
Mr Harris further urged people to ensure they had a fully stocked first aid kit at home to try to avoid calling on the health service and take care in the forecast heavy rain.
""Things are very pressured right across the health service - a lot of planning goes into every sort of peak even and New Year's Eve is no exception,"" he said.
""So we'll be putting on more specialist resources over the night and we'll be setting a specific command structure to manage our response to the incidents and the demand comes in.
""There may be times where demand is greater than our capacity to respond and at those times some people may be advised that we don't have and ambulance that can attend their call or they'll be asked to wait."""	/news/uk-wales-64126632
technology	Lancashire and Cumbria trial drones for blood sample deliveries	"Hospitals in Lancashire and Cumbria are trialling using drones to transport NHS medical samples.
Flying drones will cut delivery times between hospitals by more than an hour and speed up pathology results, the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust (UHMBT) said.
Electrically-charged drones will slash the trust's carbon footprint, it added.
Phil Woodford from UHMBT said the Â£1.4m project will cut out traffic delays and pollution.
It is part of the government's Future Flight Challenge to develop greener ways of flying.
first phase of the 20-month trial will see samples flown by the drones between the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and Westmorland General and Furness General Hospitals in Cumbria in their own dedicated airspace at 250ft (76m) above ground level.
uld include the Royal Preston Hospital.
Similar trials have been carried out from Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight and in Northumbria. 
Currently medical samples in Lancashire travel between hospitals by van, taxi or motorbikes, several times a day.
Mr Woodford told BBC Radio Lancashire: ""This is electrically charged and runs on batteries by utilising solar and wind back at the landing pads we can get this to net zero and any surplus by solar or wind we can put back to the grid.""
He said it was ""unnecessary"" to add to pollution and have someone sitting in traffic ""when we have a machine that can do it for us safely"".
rones will cut down delivery time to 15 mins ""against a journey which might have been an hour or more"", he said. 
Prof Anthony Rowbottom MBE, clinical director for pathology at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals, added the project ""will revolutionise deliveries"".

entertainment	Black Americans' complex response to Harry and Meghan's Netflix series	"WATCH: A clip from the first episode of the Harry and Meghan Netflix series
Bryndis Roberts watched the Harry & Meghan documentary series with tears in her eyes. 
An avid fan of the royals since the days of Princess Diana, she said she cried watching the family being hounded by the tabloids and Prince Harry describing how he and his brother, Prince William, have grown apart.  
But as a 65-year-old black woman who grew up in the segregated American South, Roberts said it was the frank discussions around race and racism that resonated with her most.  
She said she recognised some of her own experiences in Meghan's admission that she felt she constantly had to prove herself and would never be good enough.  
""I've been called an angry black woman, and all of the tropes that are used to demean and dehumanise black women, and so I certainly empathised and sympathised with [the duchess],"" she said. 
Race was a core theme of the six-part series, but not in the way many had anticipated.  
re were no new revelations about Meghan's explosive allegation in her Oprah Winfrey interview that an unnamed member of the royal family had commented on how ""dark"" their baby's skin would be.  
Instead, the couple used the Netflix show to argue that Meghan's biracial heritage was often an underlying factor in what they described as a relentless tabloid campaign against her - and more obviously in the racist abuse she suffered online.  
It's a narrative that Roberts recognises. Back in 2018, she helped popularise the hashtag #SussexSquad when her timeline was flooded with racist comments about Meghan after the royal wedding. The trend quickly amassed a following from men and women around the world - predominately people of colour - who wanted to use social media to support the duchess and her family instead of tearing them down. 
""One of the things about dog whistles is that if you've not experienced the racism, or if you've not been the victim of it, then you don't recognise it,"" Roberts said. ""What may seem innocent to someone else, you can see, no that's not meant to be innocent at all."" 
In the series, Prince Harry revealed that one of the first reactions he saw to the announcement of his son Archie's birth was a tweet from Danny Baker, a former BBC presenter, who posted a picture of a couple holding hands with a chimp.  
""At the top it said, 'Royal baby leaving the hospital'. That was one of the first things I saw,"" Prince Harry said. Mr Baker apologised and was later fired.  
American tech entrepreneur Christopher Bouzy told the BBC that the couple's children were regularly compared to monkeys in online attacks, with the N-word frequently used against Meghan.  
Bouzy featured in the series after his company, Bot Sentinel, found that a small but powerful number of anti-Meghan accounts were responsible for much of the hateful content on Twitter. 
""This mimics something out of a Russian troll farm,"" Bouzy said. ""I'm not saying there aren't folks out there who just don't like her for whatever reason, but it's my opinion looking at the entire picture of these hate accounts that you can't look at that and come to the conclusion that this is not about race."" 
RS Locke, an American royal watcher and commentator, claimed the vitriol against Meghan was rooted in misogynoir, a hatred for a person simply because they're black and a woman. The documentary series, she said, captured the dramatic shift in tone of media coverage that she'd witnessed in the years after the royal wedding. 
""The UK, much like the broader world, wants to see themselves as accepting and embracing this very diverse, modern couple,"" she said. But the backlash and racist abuse Meghan says she endured since showed just how far there was to go.   
""It's a tug-of-war between how we see ourselves, and who we are."" 
While many black Americans welcomed Harry and Meghan talking about racism - as well as difficult issues such as the legacy of slavery and colonialism - the duchess has also been criticised for saying she felt blindsided by the realities of living as a black woman.  
In the second episode of the series, Meghan grapples with what it was like growing up as a biracial woman in America. The duchess implies she was never discriminated against or ""treated like a black woman"" until she moved to the UK.  
Growing up, she explained, her mother never had ""the talk"" with her, referring to the frank discussion that many families are forced to have about the realities of racism, discrimination, and the challenges of being a person of colour in America.   
For some watching the series, that admission felt like a slap in the face.  
""I don't understand that, how was she raised by a whole black woman in America and then she says that her parents never talked to her about being black,"" one user posted on Twitter. ""We're supposed to see her as this black woman but she never related to us.""  
Others wanted the duchess to clarify if she had even identified as a black woman before marrying Prince Harry. 
Roberts said she felt that statement showed that colourism is still an issue in the United States and that she didn't want to perpetuate that prejudice by blaming the duchess for having different life experiences than she did growing up with a darker complexion.    
Many online agreed with her.  
""It's Meghan realising being allowed in doesn't necessarily mean acceptance. Diversity is not necessarily inclusion,"" one user tweeted. ""It's a moment most Black people have and it's time to choose is my seat at the table worth the pain and humiliation."" 
Roberts said watching Harry and Meghan present their version of what happened - and what went wrong - was especially emotional because it felt like a missed opportunity for the royal family. 
""It's just tragic that the institution didn't realise what jewels they had in Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan and they didn't say, 'These two people can reach members of the British public and the Commonwealth that the rest of us cannot reach,'"" she said. "	/news/world-us-canada-64009156
technology	Technoblade: Minecraft YouTuber dies from cancer aged 23	"Minecraft YouTuber Technoblade has died aged 23, his family have confirmed in an emotional farewell video posted on his behalf.
, entitled ""so long nerds"" and posted to his 10 million followers, showed his father calling him ""the most amazing kid anyone could ever ask for"".
US internet personality rose to fame livestreaming and posting clips of himself playing the sandbox video game.
Last year, Technoblade revealed to fans he had been diagnosed with cancer.
farewell message, written hours before his death and read by his father, began: ""Hello everyone, Technoblade here. If you're watching this. I am dead.""
He went on to reveal that his real name was in fact Alex, reminiscing about the time he had pranked viewers into believing his name was Dave. 
""Thank you all for supporting my content over the years,"" he continued. ""If I had another hundred lives, I think I would choose to be Technoblade again every single time as those were the happiest years of my life.""
r, who won Minecraft tournaments and legions of fans talking about his life in a humorous way while playing the game, explained in a fundraising video posted in February that he had undergone chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a limb salvage operation after developing a painful tumour in his right arm.
He died from sarcoma, which is a rare bone and soft tissue cancer.
He disclosed his cancer diagnosis in August 2021, explaining that he initially thought the pain he was feeling was from a repetitive stress injury due to excessive gaming. After his arm became swollen he went to hospital and was subsequently diagnosed with cancer.
Little is known about Technoblade, who kept his true identity concealed until the end. But his online avatar was a picture of a crowned pig. 
He has 10.8 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, where he bio reads: ""I play video games too much. I might not be the best, but I do have hot elbows."" 
Following the news of his death, fans, fellow gamers and YouTubers paid tribute online.
""I'll never forget the day I met Technoblade,"" recalled J Schlatt. ""I left work early to play in a Minecraft tournament with him. I barely knew how to play... and the dude still carried us to win the entire event.
""Rest in peace, big guy. You'll always be a legend.""
YouTuber Captain Puffy aka Cara tweeted: ""Rest in peace Technoblade, He always treated me with pure kindness and never excluded me from anything. He couldn't of been a kinder person!""
She added: ""Thank you for everything you've done for this community, it will never be the same without you.""
mmy Innit said: ""Technoblade is a legend. From being a massive fan, to one of his actual friends, I can't describe how thankful I am to have been in his life. I just know he's strategizing in heaven on how to beat God...""
""I've been rewatching Technoblade's for the past hour,"" added Ludwig Ahgren. ""He was so witty and so humble even in the toughest of times. I'll always look up to him.""
Quackity expressed gratitude online too, posting: ""I had the opportunity to express to Technoblade how much admiration and respect I had for him, not only for the massive impact he had on all of us, but also for keeping his incredible humour even in the darkest moments. I will miss him so much.""
""May he rest in peace,""added eSports gamer Jake Lucky.
's father thanked fans in the farewell video, noting: ""You meant a lot to him.""
He explained that a portion of proceeds from online orders for his late son's merchandise would now go to charity.
with a written statement from his family, which read: ""We, the family of Technoblade, wanted all of you to know just how much he adored and respected his fans and colleagues.
""From Technoblade's earliest online days, he was always strategizing ways to delight and reward his audience - giving away online prizes, encouraging good sportsmanship, and most of all sharing his Minecraft adventures for entertainment and laughs.
""Even after his eventual successes he somehow managed to keep his good-natured humility, competing with an endearing balance between confidence and self-deprecating wit.""
Minecraft allows players to create their own experience in an imaginative virtual landscape, by digging holes to collect blocks.
Recent updates of the game have been used to help children explore and develop their career skills and knowledge, and to find solutions to real world problems such as flooding.
Nevison described Technoblade as being ""effortlessly funny"" and ""endlessly talented"". ""Gone too soon,"" he said.
Bad Boy Halo also paid tribute, adding: ""Words can't express how much you will be missed. The lives you've touched and the impact you've had on them will last forever.""
Slimecicle said Technoblade's ""personality and sense of humour were a true inspiration to me and countless others.""

entertainment	Duran Duran star Andy Taylor has stage four cancer	"Duran Duran's original guitarist Andy Taylor has been diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer.
musician revealed the diagnosis in a letter read by his former bandmates as they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday.
was meant to be as a reunion for the band, whose classic line-up has not played together since 2006.
r said he was ""massively disappointed"" to miss the show, and had ""bought a new guitar"" for the occasion.
Singer Simon Le Bon read Taylor's letter to the audience, which read: ""Just over four years ago I was diagnosed with stage four metastatic prostate cancer. 
""Many families have experienced the slow burn of this disease and of course we are no different; so I speak from the perspective of a family man but with profound humility to the band, the greatest fans a group could have and this exceptional accolade.""
r, who was born in Tynemouth, wrote that he was receiving ""sophisticated life-extending treatment"", but had recently suffered a ""setback,"" that prevented him travelling to Los Angeles for the ceremony.
""Although my current condition is not immediately life-threatening there is no cure,"" he added.
Formed in Birmingham, Duran Duran were one of the biggest pop bands of the 1980s, known for their lavish videos and danceable, synthesized pop singles.
were first band to be inducted at this year's Hall of Fame concert, and opened the show with a hit-packed medley that included Girls On Film, Hungry Like The Wolf and Ordinary World.
Dolly Parton, Eminem, Lionel Richie, Eurythmics, Pat Benatar, Eminem, Carly Simon, Harry Belafonte and Judas Priest were also added to the Hall of Fame roster.
Parton, whose hits include Jolene, I Will Always Love You and 9 To 5, initially rejected her nomination, saying she didn't think country music was eligible, but later relented.
""I'm a rock star now!"" she said during her acceptance speech. 
""Back when they said they were going to induct me into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I didn't really think that I'd done enough to deserve that. I didn't understand at the time. But this is a very, very special night for me.""
Afterwards, the singer performed a star-studded version of Jolene, joined by Pat Benatar, Eurythmics' singer Annie Lennox, Simon Le Bon, Brandi Carlile, and Judas Priest's Rob Halford.
Eminem was inducted by Dr Dre, who said almost everyone he knew had tried to discourage him from working with a white rapper.
But ""I knew that his gifts were undeniable,"" Dre said. ""Each of us was what the other one needed - and I was willing to bet my entire career on it.""
Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers, used his speech to namecheck the rappers who had influenced him, from pioneers Tupac, Chuck D, Outkast and Snoop Dogg to more underground names like Lord Finesse and JJ Fad.
He did so partly to highlight the Hall of Fame's lack of recognition for hip-hop (he is only the ninth rap act to be inducted alongside Run DMC, NWA, Jay-Z, LL Cool J, Biggie Smalls, Tupac Shakur, Public Enemy, Beastie Boys and Grandmaster Flash).
""Those were my rock stars, man,"" said the musician. ""And I just want to say, those are just a few of the names that I hope will be considered in the future for induction. Because without them, a lot of us wouldn't be here. I know I wouldn't.""
Eminem went on to perform his hits My Name Is, Rap God and Sing for the Moment - the latter accompanied by Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, who was sampled on the original song.
He then brought out Ed Sheeran for a live rendition of Stan.
""I'm not supposed to be here tonight,"" said Eminem following his set. ""One, I'm a rapper; two, I almost died from an overdose; and three, I really had to fight my way throughâ¦ I'm a high school drop-out with a hip-hop education.""
Janet Jackson inducted her long-time collaborators, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.
uo started out in the Prince side project The Time before becoming one of America's most prominent production teams, writing hits like the SOS Band's Just Be Good To Me, Mary J Blige's No More Drama, Usher's U Remind Me and almost all of Jackson's singles, including What Have You Done For Me Lately, Rhythm Nation, That's The Way Love Goes and Together Again.
""I feel like we broke through the music industry together,"" said Jackson ""They taught me so much, and I learned their lessons well.
""When I went to work on what became Control in their hometown of Minneapolis, there was pressure. We felt like we were kids in a sandboxâ¦ We talked and laughed so much that sometimes it didn't even feel like we were making a record.""
British metal band Judas Priest took the stage with estranged guitarist KK Downing, who in 2011, playing classics like You've Got Another Thing Comin', Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight.
""I'm the gay guy in the band,"" said frontman Rob Halford. 
""We call ourselves the heavy metal community, which is all-inclusive, no matter what your sexual identity is, what you look like, or what you believe in or don't believe in. Everybody's welcome.""
Eurythmics were inducted by U2's the Edge, Lionel Richie by Lenny Kravitz, and Carly Simon by Sara Bareilles.
Simon, whose two younger sisters both died in recent weeks, declined to perform, but Barailles took her place, singing Nobody Does It Better, followed by Olivia Rodrigo who delivered a strutting version of You're So Vain.

technology	Why smart thermostats don't always save you money	"A few years ago, Dominic McCann realised that his smart thermostat was a treasure trove of data. So he decided to hack it, in order to track what his boiler was doing literally every minute of the day.
Using open source software, he accessed data from the thermostat online and plotted graphs that charted boiler activity against the changing temperature of a particular room. And when he upgraded the bi-folding door in his dining room to a triple-glazed model, the system instantly captured the difference that made.
""I could quickly get a handle on, 'Oh, if I do this, I've saved this amount of energy,'"" he recalls. Insights like this helped him to save money, over time.
Mr McCann, who lives in Manchester, was aided by his technical background. He is director of Azymuth Acoustics UK, a noise assessment firm. When he first tinkered with his thermostat, back in 2019, he was arguably in a small minority. 
But with rocketing energy prices, and the associated cost-of-living crisis, more people are turning to their smart thermostats seeking answers to the question: how do I reduce my energy bill?
Generally speaking, a smart thermostat is a connected version of a traditional central heating controller - one you can program and adjust via a smartphone or tablet app, or smart speaker. 
Manufacturers have long touted these gadgets as money savers. Over the years, they have certainly provided increasingly detailed information about users' energy consumption and offered partially automated heating control. 
And yet there is still debate over how beneficial smart thermostats are, with some research indicating that installing one doesn't always result in reduced energy use.
Google Nest, Honeywell, Drayton Wiser, Tado, Hive - all these brands say their systems make it easier to manage your heating. And many offer to learn how you heat your home, or detect when you're out, and respond automatically in an effort to curtail usage and save you money.
Mr McCann was arguably ahead of his time. In response to the cost-of-living crisis, smart thermostat maker Tado recently launched a software update that provides monthly bill predictions to help users keep within a budget. There are also room-by-room comparisons so people can see which rooms in their home require the most heating.
A spokesman for Tado says that the ""vast majority"" of its users are able to save money with its system.
re are more than 75 million smart thermostats installed worldwide and this number is expected to more than double by 2025, according to Neil Barbour, an industry analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
He cites research from The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which estimated that smart thermostats enable a roughly 10% reduction in home heating and cooling per household. 
With that in mind, Mr Barbour and his colleagues have calculated that the US could reduce its total energy consumption by 45.4 terawatt hours - roughly the same amount of energy used by the entire state of Mississippi in 2020 - if every home with a heating, ventilation and cooling system installed a smart thermostat by 2026.
would be quite a saving. But the research on how people actually use these devices paints a mixed picture. One study of Honeywell smart thermostat data from 1,379 households in California, published in September, found that users generally undid the benefits of the gadgets by manually overriding their scheduled programme of heating or cooling. 
In other words, it was easy to boost the heating, for example, which meant some people eroded their energy savings.
However, a separate analysis published in 2020 of data from 20,000 Ecobee smart thermostats in the US found that users sometimes overrode their device's schedule in a way that used less energy. So manual interventions, overall, were not as costly as expected. The study was part-funded by Ecobee.
Smart thermostats may struggle when users expect them to do all the work for them, suggests the lead author of the second study, Brent Huchuk, who now works for tech firm PassiveLogic.
According to him, someone who is good at tweaking their own system is likely to do better than a smart thermostat.
""It's pretty hard to beat someone who's actively managing [their] heating and cooling schedule,"" he says.
He also notes that the automatic interventions of smart thermostats will be limited when people work from home, since that reduces the number of opportunities the smart device has to shut the heating off. 
re are also technical quirks to be aware of. In the UK, for instance, some highly energy efficient boilers on the market can modulate (adjust up or down) how much energy they use, in response to the amount of heating required.
But to take full advantage of this, you have to choose a smart thermostat that is fully compatible with your specific model of boiler. The Heating Hub, an independent consumer advice organisation, has published details about this online.
""It's such a minefield for households,"" says founder Jo Alsop.
In the future, smart thermostats could theoretically track energy prices in real-time and allow people to heat their homes when it is cheapest to do so, suggests Dr Huchuk. 
A 2017 study by Enrico Costanza at University College, London, and colleagues, experimented with exactly this idea. Participants received specially designed thermostats that displayed sample pricing data moment-by-moment.
might be a little too much information for many. But the study suggested that, across multiple households, this could prompt a reduction in overall energy consumption. 
Prof Costanza argues that, in reality, it would be more useful to give people information about their energy use over a longer period, say a month, or a forecast that explains how much someone could save by heating the house a little less in the morning, for example. 
""Making it easier for people to understand how they spend energy can make a difference,"" says Prof Costanza.

politics	World Cup: Chris Bryant urges Mark Drakeford to stay away	"A senior Welsh Labour MP has joined calls for Wales' first minister not to attend the World Cup in Qatar.
Chris Bryant said his message to Mark Drakeford and Economy Minister Vaughan Gething, who is also going to a match, was that they would not change Qatar's view on human rights.
""They have very settled views, they think homosexuality is a perversion,"" the Rhondda MP said. 
But Mr Gething said: ""We still look to engage, to encourage, to persuade.""
Mr Drakeford, Welsh Labour's leader, will watch Wales play USA, while Mr Gething will be at the match against England.
my minister has protested to the Qataris about what he called ""appalling comments"" by Khalid Salman, a World Cup ambassador, who said homosexuality was ""damage in the mind"".
Mr Gething defended the decision for ministers to attend Wales matches, insisting ""we won't be turning a blind eye"" to human rights abuses.
Mr Bryant said: ""I don't think it is safe for gay football fans to go to Qatar.
""Some of the things they've been saying in the last few days really make me doubt that they will be safe.
""I'd say to Mark and Vaughan - you may think you can convince them to change their minds on human rights. You won't. 
""I know that Mark and Vaughan's commitment to LGBT rights is absolute so I absolutely hope that they won't go.""
On Tuesday, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said that as a ""gay man"" he believed it would send the wrong message for Mr Drakeford to go to Qatar.
Mr Gething agreed that it was ""not an unreasonable ask"" to question whether the Welsh government should go, but believed that it was ""appropriate"" for them to travel to the tournament.
""The first minister should still be at our first game at a men's World Cup for 64 years and I shall still be attending the game against England,"" he added.
Mr Gething promised that ministers would not ignore ""those issues where we disagree and where we have concerns"" and has written to Qatar's ambassador to the UK asking for confirmation that fans will be safe.
""We are seeking assurance that commitments that have been made are going to be kept,"" he said. "	/news/uk-wales-politics-63574560
entertainment	Shania Twain: I was touch and go with Covid	"Shania Twain's recent Netflix documentary, Not Just A Girl, captures footage of the country megastar in London working on her sixth album.
She pulls up in a black cab, her hair tied in a knot, and plonks down on a sofa to record a song called What You Gonna Do With That Air?
It's a bright pop anthem that has Twain punching the sky as she reaches the chorus... but it turns out the inspiration was much darker.
""It's about the anxiety of running out of air,"" the singer explains. 
""I had a very bad bout with Covid, with Covid pneumonia, and it was very touch-and-go. I was feeling like, oh my God, I just have to breathe.""
was particularly frightening because Twain had experienced that constriction in her throat before. 
At the height of her fame in 2003, she was bitten by a tick and contracted Lyme disease, causing nerve damage to her vocal cords that stopped her singing for almost a decade.
She only recovered after open throat surgery, re-emerging in 2012 with a newfound rasp to play the first of two blockbuster Las Vegas residencies.
After Covid, Twain came out swinging again. What You Gonna Do With That Air is both a celebration of life and a challenge to herself: what will you do with the extra time you've been given?
""The Super Bowl would be a great one,"" she smiles, referring to the high-profile half-time show. ""That's a good target. I just need to think about which songs.""
57-year-old has always been a survivor.
Born in Windsor, Canada, her childhood was tough. She recalls her parents being unable to afford food and ""the humiliation of going to school dirty because we didn't have water"".
""It took a lot of mental management to keep your chin up and function without letting it shut you down.""
re was violence at home, too. In her autobiography, Twain recalled a night when her mother's second husband knocked his wife unconscious then tried to drown her in the toilet. Twain grabbed a chair and smashed it across his back. He punched her in the jaw. She retaliated. At the time, she was 11 years old.
""Thank God for music, because I was literally able to escape my reality,"" she says.  
""I started to see my guitar as a teddy bear. Even now, if there's a guitar in the room, I just want to sit and hold it. I don't need to do anything with it, it's just kind of like a blankie.""
As her talent grew, Twain's mother pushed her on stage. She would often be pulled out of bed at one in the morning to play local clubs, where licensing laws meant she couldn't sing while alcohol was being served.
Although she was making a name for herself, her ambition was not to become a star, but to sing backing vocals for Stevie Wonder.
""I didn't have any desire to be in the front,"" she recalls. ""I always had terrible stage fright.""
When she was 21, fate cruelly intervened. Twain's mother and stepfather died in a car crash and she was forced to take a job singing in a local resort to support her younger siblings. That ultimately led to a recording contract, and she was thrown into the bear pit of the music industry.
""But by the time I made it to Nashville, I was like, OK, this doesn't scare me. I'm not afraid of a few sexist men. I made it through my childhood and the rest was a lot easier.""
She certainly needed resilience. Early headlines asked questions like: ""She's hot, but can she sing?"", while musician Steve Earle notoriously called her ""the highest-paid lapdancer in Nashville"".
But Twain had the last laugh. She became one of the first ""crossover"" stars, successfully fusing country melodies to the bombast of stadium rock.
formula was all hers (while other country singers idolised Patsy Cline, she sang Pat Benatar in a teen covers band), but it was realised by her then-husband Robert ""Mutt"" Lange, the producer behind AC/DC's Back In Black and Def Leppard's Hysteria. 
r first album together, 1995's The Woman In Me, went platinum 12 times over. The follow-up, 1997's Come On Over, sold more than 40 million copies, thanks to the megaballad You're Still The One and funny, empowering anthems like That Don't Impress Me Much. It's still the world's best-selling album by a female artist, and the ninth best-seller of all time in the US.
""I've been accused of changing the sound of country music forever,"" she says matter-of-factly. ""But I've also been accused of ruining country. I've been accused of a lot of things.""
Despite the criticisms, Twain's songs avoid anger and retribution. When she writes about feminism, on tracks like Man! I Feel Like A Woman!, the lyrics are life-affirming and celebratory. 
""There's no point in being angry. It doesn't get us anywhere,"" she says. ""Every man that I see singing Man! I Feel Like A Woman! is doing it in a good spirit, because that was my intention.
""This is not a man's world and it's not a woman's world. This is our world and we have to share it respectfully. 
""But I will stand up for myself and I will tell you if I feel you've crossed the line.""
wain was in the middle of a world tour when she caught Lyme disease. In her documentary, she recalls how the symptoms included ""millisecond blackouts"" that occurred once every minute.
""Before I was diagnosed, I was on stage very dizzy. I was afraid I was gonna fall off.""
It wasn't just the end of her career that Twain faced at that moment, but the end of her marriage. Lange was having an affair with her best friend, Marie-Anne ThiÃ©baud, and they divorced in 2008. (Twain later married ThiÃ©baud's ex-husband, Frederic, a complicated development that her documentary subtly leaves to one side.)
feelings all fed into her last album, Now, released in 2017 and written entirely on her own.
""I tried to scream/But silence haunted/Me in my sleep/Oh, and probably always will,"" she sang on the slow-burning ballad I'm Alright.
On her forthcoming album, however, Twain's irrepressible optimism is back. 
""With the pandemic, I just really wanted to cheer myself up,"" she says. ""As we all know, it was a very stifling and crippling emotional and mental exercise that endured for months and months and months.
""So I was like, I just want to be happy! And to me, that was writing happy songs and playing with words again.""
A release date for the album is still to come - but the first single, Waking Up Dreaming, has gone straight onto BBC Radio 2's playlist. 
music arrives as Twain's stock is on the rise, with artists like Taylor Swift, Avril Lavigne and Haim singing her praises as a trailblazer and a feminist icon. 
Harry Styles is a fan, too, asking the star to duet with him at the Coachella Festival.
""It's surreal that I have classic music and I'm still alive,"" she laughs. ""I feel like it's happening too soon, almost.
""The funny thing is, I remember seeing all these little kids at my concerts all these years ago, and now they're grown up and they're the Harry Styles and the Taylor Swifts.

business	Elon Musk threatens to walk away from Twitter deal	"Elon Musk has threatened to walk away from his $44bn takeover of Twitter, accusing the social media company of ""thwarting"" his requests to learn more about its user base.
In a letter filed with regulators, Mr Musk said he was entitled to do his own measurement of spam accounts.
r formalises a dispute that has simmered for weeks after Mr Musk declared the deal ""on hold"" pending further information.
witter has defended its estimates.
But Mr Musk has said he believes spam and fake accounts represent a far greater share than the less than 5% of daily users that Twitter reports publicly.
""As Twitter's prospective owner, Mr Musk is clearly entitled to the requested data to enable him to prepare for transitioning Twitter's business to his ownership and to facilitate his transaction financing. To do both, he must have a complete and accurate understanding of the very core of Twitter's business model - its active user base,"" lawyer Mike Ringler wrote in the letter.
""Based on Twitter's behaviour to date, and the company's latest correspondence in particular, Mr Musk believes the company is actively resisting and thwarting his information rights,"" the letter said.
""This is a clear material breach of Twitter's obligations under the merger agreement and Mr Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement.""
ute has raised more doubts about the future of the takeover, which Twitter's board approved in April. 
""Twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement,"" the company said in a statement.
witter, which has said Mr Musk waived typical rights to due diligence in his eagerness to clinch the deal, added that it intended to complete the takeover at the agreed price and terms.
Mr Musk, who faces a $1bn break-up fee and possible lawsuit if he opts out, first raised the issue of the spam accounts on social media last month, saying the deal was on hold but he remained committed to the acquisition. 
Analysts have said the Tesla boss might be using the issue to try to renegotiate the price or even walk away. They said Mr Musk's decision to raise the issue on social media was unconventional, making it difficult to establish how serious he was. 
When Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal defended the company's process in a series of tweets, Mr Musk responded with a poo emoji.
Mr Musk has said he believes that bots could account for 20% or more of Twitter users. The letter, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, confirms that the two sides have gone back and forth on the issue since early May.
It says Mr Musk merits ""reasonable cooperation"" as he tries to line up financing for the deal. 
""Twitter's latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company's own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr Musk's data requests,"" the letter says. 
""Twitter's effort to characterise it otherwise is merely an attempt to obfuscate and confuse the issue.""
xas attorney general Ken Paxton entered the debate on Monday, saying he had launched an investigation into Twitter for ""potentially false reporting over its fake bot accounts"". Twitter has until 27 June to respond to his request for information.
Mr Musk's plans for the company have drawn intense scrutiny from regulators around the world, while raising some alarm among investors of electric car company Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX, which Mr Musk also leads. 
He has lined up outside investors to help pay for the takeover and is also using equity and loans backed by his Tesla shares, which have been hit in recent weeks as market turmoil wipes billions from the values of companies including Tesla.
made Mr Musk's offer of $54.20 per share for Twitter look even more generous. On Monday, Twitter shares were trading below $39, down 3%, though they later regained some ground. They have yet to return to the highs they hit last month shortly after Mr Musk revealed he had purchased about 9% of the firm's shares.
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the letter marked the ""strongest signal yet that the Tesla founder is prepared to walk away"".
""This is a move Twitter investors have for weeks been steeling themselves for: the moment when Elon Musk's haphazard ruminations in tweets have been distilled into an official letter to regulators,"" she said. ""However, given the added volatility which has hit the tech sector since Mr Musk made his offer, it's highly likely he's after a cheaper price even if Twitter does provide the data requested in support of its initial analysis."""	/news/business-61709782
business	Steel import tariffs extended for two years	"riffs on steel imports that were due to expire will be retained for a further two years, the government said.
International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the plans departed from the UK's ""international legal obligations"" but was in the ""national interest"" to protect steel makers.
She added the decision was made due to ""global disruptions"" to energy markets and supply chains.
British steel producers are under pressure from soaring energy prices.
Steelmaking is a key industry for some parts of the UK, where it employs 34,000 people and turns over Â£2bn annually. 
Without controls the government has warned the supply of steel into the UK could rise substantially, harming local manufacturers.
UK Steel previously said ending the import controls could cause as much as Â£150m a year in damage.
Speaking at the G7 summit in Germany at the weekend, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said keeping the import controls on foreign steel would protect metal manufacturers.
But there were concerns such a decision could breach international law as the question of extending tariffs on steel imports is seen as potentially breaking World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments.
Ms Trevelyan said the decision ""departs from our international legal obligations"" of a WTO agreement.
""However, from time to time, issues may arise where the national interest requires action to be taken,"" she added.
mits on steel imports were first introduced by the European Union in 2018 in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The controls were mirrored by the UK after Brexit.
restrictions, which add a tax to steel imports once a certain quota has been reached, are known as ""steel safeguards"" because they are designed to protect the domestic market from surges of cheap steel from overseas.
Mr Johnson said: ""We need British steel to be provided with much cheaper energy.""
rols are currently in place for 15 categories of steel. While controls protecting 10 of those categories have already been extended to 2024, import limits on five categories were set to expire on 30 June, before the government extended them for two years.
Steelmaking accounts for just 0.1% of the UK economy - but the material being used in crucial sectors, from defence to transport, means that it's considered an important industry to shelter from cheaper imports.
's why the EU applied tariffs to some types of foreign steel, primarily on steel from China, in 2018, when the UK was a member.
Now the UK has chosen to roll over many of those controls. 
move, which has been expected for some months, was reported as one reason for the resignation of the Prime Minister's ethics adviser Lord Geidt - but he later dismissed the issue as a ""distraction"". 
rade Secretary Anne Marie Trevelyan admits the extension of tariffs could be at odds with World Trade Organization rules - but claims it reflects exceptionally challenging times for the industry, especially in light of high energy costs.
She has consulted other countries in the hope of avoiding a challenge, in the process attracting controversy for missing a parliamentary hearing on the Australian trade deal.
With the EU and US also retaining similar tariffs, it underlines the tough choices between removing trade barriers, and protecting national businesses.
Alasdair McDiarmid, operations director of the steelworkers' union Community, welcomed the extension saying it was ""extremely important"".
""Government made the right call because giving up our safeguards, when the EU and US are maintaining theirs, would leave us exposed to import surges threatening thousands of jobs,"" he said.
Ms Trevelyan said maintaining tariffs would help defend a strategic industry and that British steel producers could face ""serious injury"" were the measures not maintained.
""The government is therefore actively engaged with interested parties, including those outside the UK on the future of the UK safeguards and has listened to the concerns raised,"" she added.
rgest British trade body representing the industry, UK Steel, said the measures were ""absolutely vital to the long-term health of the steel industry in the UK"".
""Deficient or absent safeguards measures risk trade diversion away from shielded markets elsewhere, resulting in surges of imports into the UK,"" said Richard Warren, head of policy and external affairs at UK Steel.
Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour's shadow international trade secretary, said: ""The extension of safeguards will come as a welcome relief to the steel sector.
""It is not anti-competitive to provide a level playing field for our steel industry,"" he said. ""I also support the decision to exclude Ukrainian steel.""
But some criticised the move, saying it would stifle the supply of much-needed steel not produced in the UK.
Despite being a ""step in the right direction,"" the Confederation of British Metalworkers boss Steve Morley said, the tariffs raise the ""very real prospect of lost orders and production being moved away from the UK.""
""British steel mills have not been able to supply the... materials our members need to support critical domestic and export supply chains, nor are they likely to be able to do so in the near future,"" he said."	/news/business-61982431
sports	Wheelchair fencing at Tokyo Paralympics: All you need to know	"Dates: 25-29 August 
Venue: Makuhari Messe Hall B
Gold medals on offer: 16
re are three disciplines in wheelchair fencing based on the type of sword used - the foil, the epee and the sabre.
weapon at 770g and is more rigid than the other swords, the foil is lighter and highly flexible while the sabre has a short, flexible blade.
In the foil event, fencers are only permitted to strike the trunk area of the opponent, while in the sabre and epee, anywhere above the waist is a valid target area.
Fencers record hits by striking their opponent cleanly in the valid area, with successful hits recorded by the electronic equipment.
During a contest, the fencers' wheelchairs are fastened into metal frames on the floor at an angle of 110 degrees. This allows freedom of the upper body only and allows the fencers' sword arms to oppose each other. The distance between the fencers is dependent on the fighter with the shorter arm reach.
Bouts last a maximum of three minutes in the preliminary pool stages of the competition, with victory going to the first fencer to score five valid hits or the one with the most hits at the end of the three minutes. 
reliminary round results form the seedings for the knockout stages. Here, bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes. The winner is the first to score 15 hits, or the highest scorer at the completion of the contest. In the event of a tie, an extra one-minute sudden death bout is held, with the first person to score a valid hit taking the contest.
In team events, teams are made up of three fencers. Each fencer faces each opponent in the other team in a single bout of three minutes. The winning team is the team with the most points when the time is up, or the first to reach a cumulative score of 45 points.
Classification divisions are based on impairment. Category A fencers have good trunk control, whereas Category B athletes have an impairment that impacts their trunk or their fencing arm.
Piers Gilliver became the first British wheelchair fencer to win a Paralympic medal for 24 years when he took silver in the epee A event in Rio and he is also a strong contender in the sabre A event. Dimitri Coutya lost out in the last eight of his competition five years ago but has improved since then and is the current epee B world champion and foil B silver medallist.
China have been the dominant nation in recent times, topping the medal table at the 2016 Paralympics and also at the 2019 World Championships. Among their stars is Shumei Tan who won two golds at the last Worlds and who will be looking to win gold in the women's sabre B event as it makes its Games debut.
Italy's Beatrice Vio, who won foil B gold in Rio, is one of the stars of the sport and featured in the Netflix documentary Rising Phoenix. She contracted meningitis aged 11 and needed to have both her legs amputated below the knee and both her arms amputated from the forearms but she fences with the aid of a special prosthesis.

welve years ago Micky Yule woke up from a coma in Birmingham, having stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED) while serving in Afghanistan. 
He lost both legs. 
week the former Royal Engineer returned to the city that saved him to win a Commonwealth Games bronze medal.
He lifted 192kg to finish third in the heavyweight benchpress final, claiming the medal which evaded him in two previous Games.
""I looked at myself and said: 'Listen, your daughter's here tonight, you're not leaving here without a medal',"" Yule told BBC Scotland.
""I was looking her straight in the eye and was bringing that emotion. It needed to mean more than ever.""
And he revealed watching fellow Scot Eilish McColgan win the gold medal in the 10,000m the night before had helped inspire him.
""I must have watched that 20 times,"" Yule added. ""In my head, she kicked three times, and that was my three lifts. She fought back when everybody thought she would quit and she didn't.
""I said: 'That's your three lifts Micky. Get a bit of that McColgan power in you. Where's that grit? Make sure you bring it.'
""I saw her run to her mum and I thought: 'That's it - her running to her mum is your daughter running to you. Don't dare quit on yourself.'""
Now 43, the Edinburgh-born athlete has undergone more than 40 operations since losing his legs and is grateful to the staff at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital who helped save his life in 2010.
Six years after suffering those life-changing injuries, he was chosen to compete as a Paralympic powerlifter at Rio 2016.
Since then, Yule has become a bronze medallist at the Tokyo Paralympic Games as well as achieving respective gold and silver in the 2020 and 2021 World Cups, which were both held in Manchester.
Before the Games he said: ""It's a strange feeling. I flew in here in a coma from Afghanistan and then spent eight weeks getting patched up and surgeries, sometimes being quite close to everything going wrong.
""But I'm back here. The people at Queen Elizabeth Hospital saved my life.
""It's not all bad, it's mixed feelings, but to be back here on a real positive note to try and win a medal for your country and be the flagbearer, I think it comes full circle to where things started 10 years ago.""
Commonwealth Games: Watch JJ Chalmers' emotional reaction to friend Yule's bronze
Meanwhile BBC Sport presenter JJ Chalmers paid an emotional tribute to Yule, his friend, after he won the bronze medal.
Like Yule, he was injured in a bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2011 while serving as a Royal Marine.
He said: ""I'm so proud of him. From coming from the military, medals don't make you a hero I can tell you that, but it's the way you conduct yourself, it's the person that you are, and Micky is that, and he's an absolute hero to me.""
Chalmers went on to pay tribute to Birmingham. 
""Because whenever people say the name of this city, I thought of the hospital and it was amazing and I'm grateful to it,"" he said. 
""But now when people say Birmingham I think of these games and this city gave me a life - that's the thing. And now I have something to live for."""	/news/uk-scotland-62435294
entertainment	Irish dancing organisation begins results fixing investigation	"An Irish dancing organisation has launched an investigation into allegations of results fixing.
An CoimisiÃºn Le RincÃ­ Gaelacha (CLRG) said its ethics committee had received allegations of several grievous breaches of its code of conduct.
It said evidence had also been provided, apparently dating back several years.
CLRG has engaged a former Court of Appeal judge to carry out the investigation.
CLRG, which is Ireland's oldest established organisation for Irish dancing, said: ""Such unethical behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated by this organisation.""
mplaints were made to An Coiste Faire (CLRG Ethics Committee) in July, with supporting documentation.
A statement was first issued to members via email last week, and that has been seen by BBC News NI.
It said: ""The evidence apparently dates back several years and identifies individuals allegedly offering various inducements to promote dancers to a higher than deserved placing at particular competitions.
""It is believed that there are a number of teachers and schools implicated in the allegations."" 
CLRG said the judge would ""oversee and supervise the immediate investigation"" into these matters ""due to the potential extent of such allegations"". 
""The process will no doubt be difficult and arduous, but this grossly unethical behaviour must be eliminated from our competitions, dance schools and governing organisations,"" the CLRG statement added.
Irish Minister for the Arts, Catherine Martin, said she would write to CLRG to ensure every possible step was taken to restore confidence in competitive Irish dancing.
She told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that her department had no regulatory or funding role in the competitions, but that the very least people could expect for their children was that they would be treated fairly.
CLRG was established by Conradh na Gaeilge, a cultural organisation which promotes the Irish language, in the late 1930s.
According to its website, the objective of An CoimisiÃºn is to preserve and promote Irish dancing and also to promote the use of the Irish language.
CLRG has members across all five continents around the world, with nine regional councils set up to oversee events.
Some of its major annual events include the All-Ireland Irish Dancing Championships, Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne (the World Irish Dancing Championships) or more locally, provincial championships in Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht.
Another statement has since been published on the CLRG website, adding that no further comment will be made until the investigation process has concluded.

A number of government departments are working up a range of options to toughen up new legislation designed to reduce the impact of industrial action.
I am told the prime minister hasn't made any decisions yet on precisely what he wants to do.
He wants to bring forward planned new laws as quickly as possible. 
meframe for doing so is expected soon, but no specific timetable is being committed to publicly yet.
Introducing new legislation isn't likely to be feasible before January and it wouldn't reduce the impact of industrial action due to happen imminently.
Ministers are thinking of extending existing plans to introduce what are known as Minimum Service Level Agreements to public transport to other sectors, including the emergency services.
would allow strikes to happen, but impose a legal floor on how limited the resulting service on a strike day would be.
Nurses, paramedics and rail staff are among those set to strike this winter.
rikes to be announced are by Border Force staff at several airports, who are walking out over Christmas in a row over pay, jobs and conditions.
Officials at the Department of Health are expected to meet trades unions as soon as Thursday to discuss broadening the range of emergencies they would be willing to respond to while a strike was under way.
As things stand, they would attend life-threatening emergencies but not others.
If there wasn't a willingness from the unions to volunteer to broaden the list of what are known as ""derogations"" or exceptions during a strike, there is a growing appetite within government to legislate to do this.
Senior ministers met on Wednesday, I understand, to discuss the options on the table.
Government figures insist they want to be ""reasonable,"" as they put it, in dealing with the waves of strike action being announced, but if trades unions behave in what they see as an ""unreasonable"" way, they have a duty to respond.
Rishi Sunak has told the BBC: ""It is my responsibility to make sure everyone can be kept safe and we can minimise the disruption on their day-to-day lives, and I will do what I need to do to make sure that is the case.""
He added that he had to ensure ""people can go about their day-to-day lives free of the enormous disruption these strikes are going to cause.""

health	China Covid: Hospitals under strain in wave of infections	"China's hospitals are already under so much pressure, following the country's rapid 180-degree shift in Covid policy, that doctors and nurses could be infecting patients.
It seems frontline medical workers are being told to come in even if they have the virus themselves because of staff shortages.
A Chinese professor specialising in health policy has been monitoring the crisis in his home country from Yale University in the United States.
Chen Xi told the BBC that he has been speaking to hospital directors and other medical staff in China about the massive strains on the system right now.
""People who've been infected have been required to work in the hospitals which creates a transmission environment there,"" he said.
China's hospitals have hastily increased their fever ward capacity to meet a huge influx of patients, but these have been filling up quickly, in part because the message is still not getting through that it is all right to stay at home if you catch the virus.
Prof Chen says much more needs to be done to explain this to people.
""There is no culture of staying at home for minor symptoms,"" he said. ""When people feel sick they all go to hospitals, which may easily crash the healthcare system.""
A rush on pharmacies has led to significant nationwide shortages of medicine used to treat a cold or the flu. Home testing kits for Covid are also hard to come by.
In Beijing, though restaurants are allowed to open again, they have very few customers and the streets are quiet.
Companies are telling employees they should return to the office, but many don't want to.
makes sense when you consider that, just weeks ago, the government was saying that there will be no swerving from zero-Covid, that those infected must go to centralised quarantine facilities and that lockdowns were necessary.
ronavirus was something to fear and Chinese people were lucky to live here because the Communist Party would not sacrifice them on the altar of opening up.
Now the goal of returning each outbreak to zero cases has been abandoned, Covid is spreading like wildfire and the line from the government is that catching this disease is not something to worry about.
China's easing of Covid restrictions was expected to unfold more slowly, much more gradually.
me street protests, in city after city, with demonstrators demanding their old lives back. They wanted to be free to move around again. There were clashes with police and the chant was going up for China's leader Xi Jinping to resign and for the Communist Party to give up power.
was the straw that broke zero-Covid's back.
According to Prof Chen, this meant that the timing of China's re-opening was ""not ideal"" but they had to do it.
He said countries like Singapore and New Zealand made their changes when infections were at bay. However, China has moved with full-blown outbreaks under way in cities like Beijing.
government ""heard the voice of the protesters"", he said, but added that this was not the ideal choice for them in terms of timing.
So the protesters may have won, but the speed of the cave-in from the government has left elderly people afraid to leave their homes.
One woman we met going for a walk with her grandson said she would stay clear of crowded places, that she would keep wearing a mask and continue to wash her hands regularly.
Yet a reluctance to be in places where infection is more likely permeates all groups in society. 
mpact on Beijing has been great.
Another reason restaurants are empty is that the city government still requires a negative PCR test result within 48 hours to dine inside. However, the majority of results are not coming through to health code phone apps. 
ms to be because the labs have been swamped with work now that Covid is spreading so rapidly.
A 34-year-old woman, who is isolating at home after catching Covid, told the BBC that the experience, so far, has been surprisingly smooth.
She said her symptoms have not been as bad as she had expected them to be and that she has everything she needs.
She also said she was much happier to have the option of recovering at home with her husband rather than in a crowded quarantine centre.
However, she too worries. She has a sister with young children, parents living alone in their hometown and a grandmother who all have to get through this period.
Doctors are taking to social media in an attempt reassure people that it is fine for them to remain at home after they catch Covid.
Officials have also started to transform China's Covid isolation centres into temporary hospital facilities, to cope with an explosion of infections. 
In just one day this week, 22,000 people in Beijing tried to get into a fever clinic.
Questions are being asked. 
Why didn't the government prepare for this earlier, with an expansion of hospital ICU capacity?
Why has it taken so long to make this switch when countries around the world had already done it?
Why did Xi Jinping's administration allow the zero-Covid approach to cause so much damage to the economy more broadly and people's livelihoods more specifically?
A renewed vaccination push has started but it too should have come before China reached this stage.
government says it is the virus which has changed, that newer strains are less dangerous and that this has meant the time was right to alter the response.
Either way, there is much more optimism now.
A group of overseas Chinese have set up a special chat on the Wechat app so that people living in other countries can share their experiences of having Covid with users in China.
goal is simple. Calm nerves. 
For sure, the next couple of months are going to be tough here. Millions of people are going to get sick and there will be many deaths.
However, the old approach was clearly unsustainable and, at last, people can see a way out."	/news/world-asia-china-63944861

Local makers based around Stirling were invited to submit ideas for The Scottish Album of the Year (SAY) Award in September. 
Phil and Franziska Huber, also known as ART FUTURO, were chosen for their sustainable designs using natural Scottish slate.
winner will be revealed at Stirling's Albert Halls on Thursday.
uple created a natural slate veneer trophy, which also functions as a Bluetooth speaker, for the winner of the Â£20,000 prize.
remaining shortlisted artists, as well as the winners of the Sound of Young Scotland Award and Modern Scottish Classic Award, will also receive bespoke prizes as well as Â£1,000.
Phil and Franziska are both originally from Switzerland, but Phil has lived in Stirling for more than 20 years and Franziska for 10 years. 
After quitting their jobs, a holiday in Llanberis in Wales sparked an idea for a new life.
""Half a mile from where we stayed was the National Slate Museum,"" said Phil. ""It was a gorgeous museum and we absolutely fell in love with slate.
""Scottish slate is often grey and Welsh is more pink, but we found out that you can find it in silver, green, black - you can find it in about 15 or 16 different colours.""
uple experimented with slate veneer, which is semi-translucent and thin enough to bend.
mponent is less than half a millimetre thick and is placed on an equally thin hessian backing.
""Our first try looked terrible,"" Phil said.
""But we back-lit the slate which made it look beautiful - you could see the veins, the structures, and all of the amazing colours.
""That was the moment we knew we wanted to do something with the material.""
While the winner's trophy also functions as a speaker, the other cube prizes can be used as lamps due to LED technology embedded within them.
Phil said the pair wanted to differentiate between the winners using different kinds of slate. 
Despite the awards appearing heavy, each of them weighs no more than 150g.
uple said they were thrilled to be chosen as the winning designers.
""It came as a surprise to us, we didn't expect it at all,"" said Phil. ""It's really fabulous, as the awards are based in Stirling and we're proper Stirling folk.""

Perth and Kinross Council said the cost of the artwork and its installation was approximately Â£115,000 and came from its lighting strategy capital budget. 
uncil said the artwork runs on electricity and has a daily running cost of about 80p, or Â£292 a year.
It is currently lit from 07:00 until 02:00, but the times will change as light levels change with the season, the council added.
It is part of the council's ambition to create a permanent light art trail within the city centre. 
words in the artwork reference a quote from Sir Patrick Geddes, a Scottish polymath perhaps best known as a town planner. 
Artist Nathan Coley said: ""I'm delighted to be launching a new permanent sculpture in Perth - a city geographically and historically in the centre of Scotland, now the home to a new illuminated text work with the word 'world' in the middle.
""It's an ambitious new sculpture that places Perth in the centre of Scotland and illuminates the city-centre with ideas and thoughts of our public and private self.
""Patrick Geddes attended Perth Academy, and I'm sure he would been delighted and intrigued to find me appropriating his words to this end.""
Mr Coley is from Glasgow and he was nominated for a Turner Prize in 2007. 
Nick Williams, chief executive of Horsecross Arts, which runs Perth Concert Hall and Theatre said: ""Sharing a wall with our Victorian auditorium, Cutlog Vennel has a long and historic association with Perth Theatre.
""The words are particularly appropriate - we hear tales of years past when locals without tickets would hold glasses up against the wall to try to hear what was happening in the theatre. 
""Illuminating the vennel with such an impactful artwork gives it some much-deserved profile in the city. We're delighted to be involved in the project.""
A spokeswoman for Perth and Kinross Council said very low energy bulbs have been used in the artwork. 
""This is a significant piece by an important Scottish artist that adds to the cultural offer in Perth and will do so for many years to come,"" she added. "	/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-63205802
business	Hundreds of jobs go as Aberdeen paper mill goes into administration	"A historic Aberdeen paper mill has gone into administration with the loss of more than 300 jobs.
Stoneywood paper mill has operated for more than 250 years.
In 2019, the business was sold to a new parent company, securing the jobs at the mill.
Administrators have now been appointed at the Arjowiggins Group mills at Stoneywood, as well as Chartham, Kent, with 368 of the group's 463 UK-based employees made redundant immediately.
A total of 301 out of 372 members of staff have been made redundant in Aberdeen.
Ninety five members of staff have been retained by the administrators to assist them with the operation of limited activity across the two sites while they explore any possibility of a sale of the sites and assets.
Blair Nimmo, chief executive of Interpath Advisory and joint administrator, said: ""Arjowiggins has a long and proud history dating back more than 260 years, so this is immensely troubling news for UK and Scottish manufacturing. 
""Unfortunately, and following on from the severe challenges posed by the pandemic, the significant economic headwinds which have been impacting industrial manufacturing businesses up and down the country, including skyrocketing energy costs and spiralling input prices, have proved to be overwhelming for the group.
""The management team has asked that we pass on their sincere thanks to all employees, customers and suppliers, plus Scottish Enterprise, for their strong support during these very difficult times, and they would like to express their deep regret that there was unfortunately no other option available for this historic group.""
Shauna Wright, of the Unite union, said: ""We are saddened to hear the news about Stoneywood Mill - particularly on the anniversary of its opening 252 years ago.
""This comes as a huge blow to our members who stood by the mill through the last administration and welcomed the management buyout, which gave them so much hope for the future.
""That hope has been shattered.""
Scottish Conservative north-east MSP Douglas Lumsden described the news as ""absolutely devastating"", and said he would be lodging an urgent question in parliament calling for Scottish government help.
""Stoneywood Mill has been a very successful business in our city for more than 250 years and everything must be done to safeguard jobs and protect its future,"" he said.
Richard Thomson, the SNP MP for Gordon, said together with Jackie Dunbar, the MSP for Aberdeen Donside, he would seek to hold an urgent meeting with the administrators to see what else could be done for those who had lost their jobs, and ""to discuss the options for preserving papermaking on the site with the aim of retaining as many jobs as possible.""   
urchase of the paper mill in September 2019 for an undisclosed sum was made by subsidiaries of a new venture, Creative Paper Holdings Ltd.

entertainment	Eurovision scraps jury voting in semi-finals	"Eurovision Song Contest has announced major changes to the voting process at next year's contest.
Professional juries have been scrapped from the semi-finals, meaning that viewers alone will choose who qualifies for the grand final.
Countries who are not competing in the contest will also be allowed to cast votes for the first time.
move comes after it was discovered that six juries traded votes at this year's contest in Turin, Italy.
Irregular voting patterns were detected from Azerbaijan, Georgia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and San Marino, said the EBU, which organises the contest.
jury votes were discounted, and substituted with an aggregate score, calculated from the results of other countries with similar voting records.
In the end, the contest was won by Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra, with the UK's Sam Ryder taking second place.
Liverpool will host the event in 2023.
Professional juries, which comprise professional songwriters and music industry figures, have existed since at least the second Eurovision Song Contest in 1957 (the voting system for the first competition has never been revealed).
Under the current system, their scores are combined with the results of a public vote to determine the overall winner. 
ractice will continue in the final, said the EBU in a press release.
V presenter Nicki Chapman, who has served on the UK jury twice, welcomed the change, saying fans often know more than the professionals.
""There'll be lots of people breathing a sigh of relief, because real Eurovision fans are online months and months in advance. They know every single song, and they'll have their favourites.
""So when Ireland gets knocked out, for example, so many people are disappointed. This [change] gives everybody the chance to put their favourite through and, when it comes to the final, the juries will have 50% of the votes.""
Allowing non-participating countries to vote will reflect ""the global impact of the event,"" said Martin Ãsterdahl, the contest's executive supervisor.
""Everyone watching the show, wherever they live in the world, can cast their votes for their favourite songs.""
Online votes from the ""rest of the world"" will be added together and converted to points that will have the same weight as one participating country in both of the semi-finals and the grand final, the EBU said.
""I love the idea it's going to go global,"" said Chapman, who worked with David Bowie, the Spice Girls and Amy Winehouse before moving into television.
""I wonder whether, say an artist such as Adele might suddenly think, 'Actually, I want to be part of this. This goes out to a global audience, I want to represent the UK'. Wouldn't that be wonderful?""
In the past, Eurovision viewers have frequently voted in opposition to the juries. This year,for example, Ukraine overwhelmingly won the tele-vote at the final, scoring 439 points, but came fourth in the jury vote, with 192.
Sam Ryder, meanwhile, was the jury members' favourite act, scoring 283 points, but came fifth with viewers at home.
rty-seven countries will take place in next year's contest, with Montenegro and North Macedonia pulling out due to the cost of participating.
Russia was expelled from this year's event after its invasion of Ukraine; and its suspension will continue in 2023.

technology	Molly-Mae Hague has Pretty Little Thing Instagram post banned	"Molly-Mae Hague has had another Instagram post banned, this time after she failed to include any mention of it being an ad.
It's the third time the 23-year-old influencer has been in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).
She posted a picture of her wearing a Pretty Little Thing (PLT) dress, along with a link to buy it, on her story.
ASA said it was not ""immediately clear"" that she had a commercial interest in PLT.
Molly-Mae is a creative director at the company, with PLT confirming their contract expressly stated the requirement for her to include the ""Â£ad"" disclosure in posts.
Someone who saw the former Love Islander's post on Halloween last year complained, saying the ad didn't make its commercial intent clear.
ASA said: ""We noted that the story had appeared in Molly-Mae Hague's own account and did not contain any indication that it was a marketing communication.""
A spokeswoman for Molly-Mae said the ""#ad"" disclosure had been left off by mistake and would be used in future.
PLT also said it had reminded Molly-Mae of the requirement to prevent any similar mistakes in future.
rd time Molly-Mae has been called out by the ASA since 2020.
But she is by no means the first influencer to have been ticked off for not labelling an ad correctly on social media.
Newsbeat spoke to the ASA's compliance executive Ed Senior last year and he told us that ""overall compliance was disappointing"".
rules say content has to ""be clear, obvious and identifiable as advertising"".
Putting a hashtag #ad is one way, but he says they could also verbally say it's an advert at the start of a video.
""It needs to be clear and obviously up front, prior to engagement. So that's why, even when they added #ad at the end, it wouldn't be enough to comply with the rules,"" Ed said.
But what happens if the rules are broken?
As you'd expect, there are different levels of sanctions.
Ed says the ASA will get someone to amend the content so it follows the rules, or get them to remove it.
If things escalate, people can be placed on a public list, with the ASA working with platforms to remove further content and eventually even referring them to legal authorities.
ASA has told Newsbeat there are measures in place specifically for influencers, including a non-compliance webpage which lists people who fail to label their content as ads - so naming and shaming basically.
From January, there has also been an ""on-platform targeted ads sanction"" on a handful of influencers who have been either unwilling or unable to consistently label when their posts are ads.
""We took out ads on Instagram, specifically flagging influencers who routinely break our rules and warning consumers about their content,"" a spokesman added.
Newsbeat has asked Molly-Mae's management for any additional comment.

technology	Why lasers are being used to write inside diamonds	"I am peering through a jeweller's eyeglass, looking for the BBC logo that has been inscribed inside a small diamond.
ription has been made using unique technology developed by Oxford-based Opsydia.
Its machines are the only ones on the market that can penetrate the surface of a diamond and manipulate its atoms.
go I am trying to find is less than half a millimetre wide. Despite instruction from Lewis Fish, head of product at Opsydia, I can't see it.
""It is very difficult,"" he says. ""They're intentionally very fine, and it is really trained jewellers they are aimed at."" 
But why would anyone want to write on the inside of a diamond? 
""The big thing that's happening in the industry is traceability and transparency,"" says Andrew Rimmer, the chief executive of Opsydia.
He believes that Opsydia's technology can improve on the existing ways that diamonds are identified.
re are already systems for tracking a diamond, from when it first emerges from a mine as a rough diamond, through the cutting and polishing phase and on to the retailer.
But the process is far from perfect. Last year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) criticised jewellers, saying many could not identify the mines of origin for their diamonds.
mportant, according to HRW, because ""labour rights violations, violence, and other abuses have remained a serious problem in gold and diamond mining"".
More technology of business:
It is also becoming crucial for diamond sellers to be able to distinguish between those that have come from mines, known as natural diamonds, and the growing number of diamonds produced by machines, known as lab-grown diamonds.
gy for producing lab-grown diamonds is improving all the time, and they are a fast-growing section of the market.
But natural diamonds are considerably more expensive than lab-grown gems, so it is important to have a reliable way of telling them apart.
Mr Rimmer explains that his systems can provide that failsafe verification, by inscribing data inside the diamond - data that is impossible to remove, but does not devalue the gem in any way.
""People who are making diamond jewellery, they want to be able to show to the consumer this is a natural diamond and from an ethical source,"" says Mr Rimmer.
Opsydia's diamond-inscribing machine is the size of a very large photocopier. Inside is a pulsed laser that emits very short laser bursts. 
Such high-powered bursts can accurately manipulate materials like diamonds and other gems at very small scales.
However, just pointing the laser at a diamond is not enough - the diamond's structure would scatter the beam.
""Diamond is about the most difficult material out of the transparent materials to process with lasers,"" says Mr Rimmer.
Opsydia's system tunes the laser so that it can pass through the surface of the diamond, usually to a depth of about a quarter of a millimetre.
Instead of randomly bouncing around the diamond, the laser comes to a pinpoint focus to create the inscription to suit the client's need.
If the diamond needs an identification number which is invisible to anyone without powerful microscopes, then the system can alter the diamond at the molecular level.
However, if a jeweller wants its logo to be visible then the laser can be used to make bigger changes to the carbon structure of the diamond.
At the moment Opsydia can assemble only a small number of the Â£400,000 ($480,000) machines at a time. But it is expanding its operation and expects soon to be selling dozens of the machines a year.
Mr Rimmer is optimistic that the laser technology will have other applications too.
r can make atomic-scale changes to create circuitry inside the diamond. That could be useful for making instruments for radiation detection, where a diamond's durability is also an asset.
Potentially such circuitry could also be used in quantum computers - machines that can perform complex calculations in a fraction of the time taken by existing devices.
Quantum computers work by exploiting the weird quantum properties of individual particles. They are hard to build and are still in their early stages, but diamonds offer a promising way to isolate and use the quantum properties of nitrogen atoms. 
More technology of business:
But for now, Opsydia is focused on the diamond verification business, and that is a good place to be, according to Edahn Golan, an Israel-based consultant to the diamond industry.
""There's a growing movement to track diamonds in an impartial way,"" he says. 
""At this point, none of the systems are perfect, because nothing is implemented fully from the mine to the store.""
gital ledger technology, blockchain, will become more widespread in the jewellery industry, according to Mr Golan.
He says the verification methods are going to evolve as miners are keen to distinguish their diamonds from those made in factories and consumers want to know their jewellery is ethically sourced.
""If I walk into your jewellery store on Main Street USA and ask: 'Can you guarantee that this particular diamond that you're offering me is ethical?' - and you blink - you have a problem,"" he says."	/news/business-62318016

health	Warning Somerset GP agency spend is 'not sustainable'	"f an organisation that provides GP services has warned a chronic reliance on expensive agency staff is ""not sustainable"".
Symphony Healthcare Services (SHS) had to spend Â£3m on locum GPs in the past financial year across Somerset.
Medical director Dr Berge Balian warned ""difficult decisions will have to be made"" without improved funding. 
Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said there are 2,300 more GPs since 2019. 
But the Royal College of GPs does not recognise that figure, and said GP numbers had fallen by 713 fully qualified full-time equivalent positions since 2019. 
Commons Health Select Committee has itself said general practice is in crisis.
Dr Balian added: ""I think most people would recognise it is currently in crisis."" 
When SHS started in 2016, it took over three GP surgeries that could not attract enough partners to run them as a private business. 
Since then it has employed more and more salaried GPs to work in 16 surgeries across 20 locations in Somerset and Devon, with all rated good or outstanding by the Care Quality Commission. 
But over the years it has had to rely more heavily on expensive agency GPs that cost up to Â£1,000 a shift. 
And because SHS is owned by Yeovil hospital, this has contributed to a Â£12m spend on agency staff last year.
Dr Balian is a GP at Crewkerne Health Centre and said many doctors are retiring early because their job has become too stressful.
""In the last three years the number of consultations general practice has done in the country has increased by two million while the number of GPs has dropped by 1,800 roughly.
""You can see why it ends up being a significant pressure on those GPs who are responsible for managing that contract and caring for patients under that contract.""
Dr Balian also said there is a financial incentive for GPs to move away from being partners to work as locum doctors because they can earn more than Â£1,000 a day and also benefit from being in the NHS pension scheme. 
SHS spent Â£3m on GP locums in the year 2021-22 and Dr Balian said expanding further, with a bigger agency staff bill, is not sustainable. 
He said: ""If you look at general practice, demand is increasing, its capacity is reducing, its funding in real terms is also reducing.
""The only solution to that is either increasing the amount of funding into GPs, or you say actually, nationally we will make a decision that GPs that used to provide this amount of service can only provide this amount of service and that bit needs to be done elsewhere.""
Since it started SHS has set up a new model for family medicine which relies heavily on health coaches, physios and pharmacists to relieve pressure.
Mary Guppy is one of a growing number of ""health coaches"" employed by SHS to support vulnerable patients living in their home.
One of her regulars, Ivan Down, 81, is at risk of having to leave his home in Crewkerne to be admitted to hospital because he has dementia, and diabetes.
Mrs Guppy says an important part of her role is to look after carers, such as Ivan's 71-year-old wife Patricia.
Mrs Guppy said: ""Without Pat, we'd have to find some more care for Ivan, but thanks to her hard work and liaising with the health coaches we can go back to the GPs if there are any health concerns so we can keep him safe in his own environment and keep him well.""
A spokesman for the DHSC said: ""Supporting and growing the workforce is one of the Health and Social Care Secretary's priorities and there are over 2,300 more doctors in general practice compared to 2019, while a record 4,000 trainees have accepted a GP training place this year.
""We have taken action to promote NHS staff banks, which are managed by trusts and allow healthcare professionals to take up temporary shifts. 
""This reduces the requirement for agency staff, and as a consequence agency spend has dropped by a third since 2016.""

entertainment	Paul Newman: Hollywood legend was so insecure, says daughter	"""He wanted to dispel the fairy tale,"" Clea Newman Soderlund says about her father Paul Newman's decision to embark on writing a memoir. 
It was 1986 and Newman had been one of the most famous movie stars in the world for three decades, starring in films including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting and The Hustler.
He was known for his brilliant blue eyes, boyish charm and seemingly idyllic 50-year marriage to the equally talented actress Joanne Woodward. 
But not everything was what it seemed. ""He wanted to dispel the perfection that things were just great,"" Soderlund, the youngest of the actor's five daughters, tells the BBC. ""Nobody's life is like that.""
So that is why, in his 60s, Newman decided to collaborate on a memoir with his friend, the screenwriter Stewart Stern. The two men talked for five years about Newman's childhood, career, family and fame.
""This was a very pivotal time for him in his life,"" explains Soderlund. ""He was doing a lot of soul searching.""
But by 1991, Newman and Stern were overwhelmed with the amount of material and gave up on the process.
Newman died in 2008, at the age of 83. Stern died in 2015.
No-one knew what had happened to the thousands of pages of interview transcripts. There was even a rumour that they had been burnt in a bonfire. 
wo years ago, they were discovered in a family storage unit, and have now been edited into a new book, The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man.
It paints a candid picture of a tortured star dogged by self-doubt, who reflects on his alcoholic father, his possessive mother, the first marriage he abandoned when he met Woodward, his own failures as a father, and his excessive drinking.
Reading the manuscripts was difficult for Newman's daughter, who found out ""a lot"" about her father that she did not know.  ""It's very raw,"" she says.
So what surprised her most? 
""He was so insecure,"" she says. ""I was born in 1965. By the time I came around, he was kind of bigger than life, because he was so famous at that time and later. So it was a whole different perspective.
""I struggled to understand how I didn't know how he could see himself so differently from the way his children and family felt about him, because he seemed to be so confident about everything.
""I knew that he never felt probably as good about his work as everybody else did, but I think I was surprised at how harshly he criticised himself.""
At one point in the book, Newman says he is ""always anxious"" about ""not being good enough"".
And he wonders how much of his career is down to him or his appearance.
r explains in the memoir: ""It is difficult for a person like me, who has always had a terrible sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach that his success comes simply from being fortunate enough to be born looking a certain way.""
Soderlund says her father wanted to be treated as so much more than good-looking.
""It was kind of heartbreaking to him that it felt like, no matter how hard he worked, he wasn't going to get anywhere: meaning he wouldn't get past that pretty face and those beautiful eyes.""
In the 1970s, Newman formed a highly successful on-screen relationship with Robert Redford. They made Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting, and for many years searched for the right script to make another film together. 
But the book reveals the pair were not really friends off screen at that time. ""You can't depend on Redford,"" says Newman. ""You're never sure he's going to be there. That's simply discourteous.""
Soderlund thinks any tension was down to different ways of working.
""My father was very much a stickler for timeliness and Bob, that was never really his strength.
""It was hard work for dad. He worked very hard at it because he wanted to be good and he wanted to be successful and Bob was more of a free spirit."" 
In the book, Newman also hints at strains in his relationship with Woodward.  He famously once said of his marriage: ""I have steak at home. Why should I go out for hamburger?""
Yet there are suggestions in the memoir of betrayals. ""We've had our problems,"" he tells a friend. ""This hasn't all been a bed of roses."" 
""Oh, there was tension,"" confirms Soderlund. ""I'm sure it wasn't a cake-walk being married to him.
""But I think the impressive thing is that they worked really hard to stay together. I give them a lot of credit that they did manage to get through a lot of really hard times and come out on the other end stronger and better.
""My father wouldn't take his last breath until my mother was holding him,"" she reveals.
As a parent, Newman is also critical of himself, declaring: ""I don't have a gift for fathering.
""I could have been more consistent with my children, I could have been more understanding. I could have been more patient.""
His son Scott died from an accidental drugs and alcohol overdose in 1978.
Soderlund remembers a dad who ""worked a lot, so he was gone a lot"". 
She adds: ""When he was home, he was a big kid. This was when I was little. He loved to play with you and throw you into the pool. He was fun. But he wasn't consistent."" 
In the decades after the conversations were recorded, Soderlund says Newman ""worked hard on himself"" and ""felt much better about himself as he got older"".
Deciding to publish the memoir, filled with so many intimate revelations and startling insights, was ""a difficult decision"", she says.
But ultimately she and her sisters decided they were following his wish. ""It's something that he wanted.""
As Newman himself says: ""I want to leave some kind of record that sets things straight, pokes holes in the mythology that's sprung up around me, destroys some of the legends, and keeps the piranhas off.
""Something that documents the time I was on this planet with some kind of accuracy."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63331321
technology	Doubts cast over Elon Musk's Twitter bot claims	"Filings made by Elon Musk's legal team in his battle with Twitter have been questioned by leading bot researchers.Â 
Botometer - an online tool that tracks spam and fake accounts - was used by Mr Musk in a countersuit against Twitter.
Using the tool, Mr Musk's team estimated that 33% of ""visible accounts"" on the social media platform were ""false or spam accounts"". 
However, Botometer creator and maintainer, Kaicheng Yang, said the figure ""doesn't mean anything"". 
Mr Yang questioned the methodology used by Mr Musk's team, and told the BBC they had not approached him before using the tool.Â 
Mr Musk is currently in dispute with Twitter, after trying to pull out of a deal to purchase the company for $44bn (Â£36.6bn).Â 
A court case is due in October in Delaware, where a judge will rule on whether Mr Musk will have to buy it. 
In July, Mr Musk said he no longer wished to purchase the company, as he could not verify how many humans were on the platform. 
Since then, the world's richest person has claimed repeatedly that fake and spam accounts could be many times higher than stated by Twitter.
In his countersuit, made public on 5 August, he claimed a third of visible Twitter accounts, assessed by his team, were fake. Using that figure the team estimated that a minimum of 10% of daily active users are bots. 
witter says it estimates that fewer than 5% of its daily active users are bot accounts.Â 
Botometer is a tool that uses several indicators, like when and how often an account tweets and the content of the posts, to create a bot ""score"" out of five.Â 
A score of zero indicates a Twitter account is unlikely to be a bot, and a five suggests that it is unlikely to be a human.Â 
However, researchers say the tool does not give a definitive answer as to whether or not an account is a bot.Â 
""In order to estimate the prevalence [of bots] you need to choose a threshold to cut the score,"" says Mr Yang.Â 
""If you change the threshold from a three to a two then you will get more bots and less human. So how to choose this threshold is key to the answer of how many bots there are on the platform.""
Mr Yang says Mr Musk's countersuit does not explain what threshold it used to reach its 33% number.Â 
""It [the countersuit] doesn't make the details clear, so he [Mr Musk] has the freedom to do whatever he wants. So the number to me, it doesn't mean anything,"" he said. 
mments raise doubts on how Mr Musk's team reached their conclusions over bot numbers on the platform.Â 
BBC put Mr Yang's comment to Mr Musk's legal team, who have not yet responded.Â 
In Mr Musk's countersuit, his team says: ""The Musk Parties' analysis has been constrained due to the limited data that Twitter has provided and limited time in which to analyse that incomplete data.""
Botometer was set up by the University of Indiana's Observatory on Social Media.
Clayton Davis, a data scientist who worked on the project, says the system uses machine learning, and factors like tweet regularity and linguistic variability, as well as other telltale signs of robotic behaviour.Â 
""Humans behave in a particular way. If an account exhibits enough behaviour that is not like how humans do things then maybe it's not human,"" he says.Â 
researchers behind Botometer have tried to calculate how many spam and fake accounts are on Twitter in the past.Â 
In 2017, the group of academics behind the tool published a paper that estimated that between 9% and 15% of active Twitter accounts were bots.
However, Mr Davis says the report was heavily caveated and reliant on limited data.Â 
""The only only person who has a God's eye view is Twitter,"" Mr Davis says.Â 
witter says it calculates the number of fake accounts through mainly human review. It says it picks out thousands of accounts at random each quarter and looks for bot activity.
Unlike other public bot analysis tools, Twitter says it also uses private dataÂ - like IP addresses, phone numbers and geolocation - to analyse whether an account is real or fake.
When it comes to Botometer, Twitter argues its approach is ""extremely limited"".Â 
It gives the example of a Twitter account with no photo or location given - red flags to a public bot detector. However the owner of the account may be someone with strong feelings about privacy. 
Unsurprisingly, Twitter says its way is the best system to evaluate how many fake accounts exist.Â 
Michael Kearney, creator of Tweet Bot or Not, another public tool for assessing bots, told the BBC the number of spam and fake accounts on Twitter is partly down to definition. 
""Depending on how you define a bot, you could have anywhere from less than 1% to 20%,"" he says.
""I think a strict definition would be a fairly low number. You have to factor in things like bot accounts that do exist, tweet at much higher volumes,"" he said.  
re is no universally agreed upon definition of a bot. For example, is a Twitter account that tweets out automated tweets, but is operated by a human - a bot? 
Fake accounts are often run by humans, while accounts like weather bots are actively encouraged on Twitter. 
Despite this definitional problem, Twitter says it detects and deletes more than a million bot accounts every day using automated tools.Â 
But its systems do not catch them all, and Twitter accepts that millions of accounts slip though the net. However, it says they make up a relatively small proportion of its 217 million daily active users. 
Some bot experts claim Twitter has a vested interest in undercounting fake accounts. 
""Twitter has slightly conflicting priorities,"" says Mr Davis. 
""On the one hand, they care about credibility. They want people to think that the engagements are real on Twitter. But they also care about having high user numbers.""
majority of Twitter's revenue comes from advertising, and the more daily active users it has, the more it can charge advertisers. 
Mr Kearney believes Twitter could have built stronger tools for finding fake accounts.
""Twitter, is perhaps not leveraging all the technology they possibly could to have the clearest answer,"" he says. 
Mr Musk's legal team says in its countersuit that Twitter should be using more sophisticated technology to estimate bot activity. 
He also accuses Twitter of not giving him enough user data for bot estimates to be independently checked. 
Mr Yang, however, believes Twitter's methodology is relatively robust and says if he had its data, he ""would probably do something similar to Twitter"" to verify accounts. 
But he also agreed that the characteristics of a bot need to be better defined.Â 
""It's important to have people from both sides sit down together and go through the accounts one by one"", he says - to agree on an accepted bot definition. 
However both sides appear done talking. In October, in a court in Delaware, we'll get a clearer idea of who the judge thinks is right. "	/news/technology-62571733
entertainment	Stoke-on-Trent teenager turns ballet passion into business	"A teenager said she was inspired to launch her own dance line after finding ballet skirts too expensive.
Lilah Bush, from Stoke-on-Trent, started Lilian Hope Designs (LHD) while in school in 2019, at the age of just 15.
Now 19, she said she hoped to roll-out more products and ultimately develop the company to create a full-time role for herself.
ugh introduction to the world of business.
""When you're under 18, people don't take you seriously,"" she said.
""I had some other dancewear brands look down on me and treat me differently because of my age... when a brand knows you're young they often think they can walk over you.""
Her first experience as an entrepreneur started three years ago when she took up ballet again after losing confidence in 2016 when she started secondary school.
She said she found ballet skirts were too expensive and the designs not to her tastes, prompting her to make one herself.
""I've always been very independent so if I can do something myself I will,"" she said.
What started as one homemade skirt became a cottage industry when she started advertising on Instagram - within two hours she had her first order.
Ms Bush said she had focused on making her products as environmentally friendly as possible, using fabrics that would otherwise go to landfill.
Recently, she made a custom made skirt all from cut off's and scraps. It was worn by dancer Sue Mills in London.
She is also planning a line made out of econyl, which is a type of recycled fabric made from sea waste.
Like other businesses she has seen her material costs rise, due to the cost of living, but said she was trying to keep her prices down.
While Lilian Hope Designs remains a small venture, with just a handful of orders each week, she hopes it can become a full-time operation.
She is already planning other new products, including costume wear such as tutus.

politics	Asylum hotel cancels couple's wedding with five weeks notice	"A couple's wedding has been cancelled by a hotel that is being used to house asylum seekers.
Lucie Campbell and Simon Pritchard booked their wedding for 10 December more than a year ago.
But they were left with just days to find a new venue after discovering the Aberconwy hotel is being used to ease overcrowding at Kent detention centres.
Ms Campbell, 28, of Towyn, Conwy, said she was in ""disbelief"" but has managed to reorganise their special day.
, which the BBC is not naming for safeguarding reasons, is providing short-term accommodation as part of a project that began last week. 
However, it has sparked ""anguish and anger"" among residents living nearby, according to politicians.
Ms Campbell and Mr Pritchard, 33, were told at the weekend that their wedding had been cancelled.
""The hotel manager and wedding coordinator said it was out of their hands. We were just in shock. We didn't really have a response,"" said Ms Campbell.
""I felt awful for them, especially the wedding coordinator as she had to break the news.""
uple, who have three children, had only days to find a new venue due to the 28 days' notice required by the registry office for wedding ceremonies.
""We had to get our heads around it. We had been on countdown and everything was done, all the suppliers booked, hair, make-up, flowers, everything,"" said Ms Campbell.
Despite the shock and a ""few tweaks"" to their plans, the couple will still marry on the same date in Llanrwst, and said they have sympathy for the asylum seekers being housed in the hotel.
Ms Campbell, a support worker, said: ""We are not worse off. We are still getting married and it's an absolutely lovely venue and the staff have been so kind.
""Since it happened, local businesses have reached out offering help, even strangers, telling us to try this place and that. It has proved there are lovely people out there.""
rators of the hotel housing the asylum seekers declined to comment.
Politicians in the area have urged the Home Office to reverse the decision due to the rural location being ""unsuitable"".
Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt said it was ""unacceptable"" the Home Office contracted the hotel without first informing the Welsh government, local council or police.
Home Office said the use of hotels was a short-term measure and provided safe and secure accommodation
A spokesman added: ""We are in dialogue with the Welsh government, Welsh local government and other statutory partners on the use of contingency hotels in the country."""	/news/uk-wales-63574284
business	Northern Ireland economy expected to shrink next year	"Ulster University economists expect the Northern Ireland economy to shrink next year, followed by a weak recovery in 2024.
Ulster University Economic Policy Centre (UUEPC) estimates that output will fall by 1.2% in 2023.
forecast for 2024 is growth of 1.7%, with a similar outlook for the UK as a whole.
It also suggests that the Bank of England may not raise interest rates much beyond the current 3%.
UUEPC director Gareth Hetherington said that a further increase in interest rates this month is ""almost inevitable"" but future increases could be smaller and ""we may be approaching the end of the current cycle of monetary tightening"".
Interest rates were just 0.25% at the start of this year but have been raised steadily as the Bank of England has tried to get on top of soaring inflation.
Mr Hetherington said the last Bank of England monetary policy committee report included analysis that suggests inflation could fall to below its 2% target over three years, even if rates stay at 3%.
""This would suggest that interest rates may not need to go any higher, but the report also stressed that risks were skewed towards higher inflation,"" he added.
UUEPC forecasts that interest rates will be 3.5% at the end of 2022 and 2023 with inflation averaging 7.4% next year."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63893672
business	Recession looms as UK economy starts to shrink	"UK economy shrank between July and September as the country heads into what is expected to be the longest recession on record.
my contracted by 0.2% during the three months as soaring prices hit businesses and households.
A country is in recession when its economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row. The UK is expected to be in one by the end of the year.
Bank of England has forecast a ""very challenging"" two-year recession.
A recession has been widely expected in the UK due to the prices of goods such as food, fuel and energy soaring, which is down to several factors, including the war in Ukraine.
Higher prices for goods has led to many households facing hardship and cutting back on spending, which has started to drag on the economy.
When a country is in recession, it's a sign that its economy is doing badly.
During recessions, companies typically make less money and the number of people unemployed rises. Graduates and school leavers also find it harder to get their first job.
means the government receives less money in tax to use on public services such as health and education.
Bank of England expects the UK recession to be the longest since records began in the 1920s and said unemployment will almost double.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said he would try to make any recession ""shallower and quicker"" than predicted.
But he has warned of ""eye-watering"" decisions needed on public spending and taxation to ""restore confidence and economic stability"".
Mr Hunt said he was ""under no illusion that there is a tough road ahead"".
He is set to unveil his tax and spending plans next week in the Autumn Statement, which comes as households are being squeezed by the worst cost-of-living crisis since the 1950s.
Sam Burrows, managing director of Bristol Beer Factory, told the BBC he has been weighing up how much of his soaring business costs can be passed on to customers in recent months.
""We can't price consumers out. We need people in pubs eating, drinking and enjoying the hospitality sector, so it's a balancing act for me,"" he said.
Mr Burrows said he wanted to invest and expand his business but was having to factor in the current economic climate.
However, he said the World Cup and Christmas were coming at the right time.
""A bit of national pride and some positive energy with a good performance in the World Cup, Christmas spending, it's all going to help hospitality,"" he added.
Countries all around the world are experiencing high price rises, but the UK economy is performing the worst compared to other major nations, and is smaller than it was before the Covid pandemic.
Office for National Statistics (ONS), which published the economic growth figures, said UK business investment had dropped in the three months to September and also remained below its pre-pandemic levels.
rformance of the economy is measured by the value of all the goods and services produced by the UK. This number is known as the gross domestic product (GDP).
fall in GDP in the three months to September was driven by a decline in manufacturing, which was seen ""across most industries"", the ONS said.
ONS publishes its estimate of GDP and does sometimes revise it upwards or downwards. For example, it initially estimated that the economy shrank by 0.3% in August, but later revised that and said it shrank by 0.1%.
Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said customer-facing industries also ""fared badly"", with shops hard hit as the squeeze on household budgets meant people were spending less.
According to Mr Morgan, the biggest concerns businesses said they were now facing were the rising price of raw materials and higher energy costs.
He said some firms had taken action to reduce costs by being ""far more diligent"", switching to more energy-efficient equipment, and changing supplier.
Mr Morgan said the additional bank holiday for Queen Elizabeth II's funeral played a part in the economy's poor performance in September as some businesses closed or had shorter opening times. The economy shrank by 0.6% alone in September.
Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the latest economic figures were ""another page of failure in the Tories' record on growth"".
""Britain's unique exposure to economic shocks has been down to a Conservative-led decade of weak growth, low productivity and underinvestment and widening inequality,"" she added.
Martin McTague, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, called the latest economic figures ""dreadful news"" for firms that were already under pressure.
""Lower levels of reserves and resources mean they are more vulnerable to downturns, and at a time when confidence is deteriorating in both consumers and businesses, the outlook for the UK economy is now very bleak indeed,"" he said."	/news/uk-63582201
politics	Wales 20mph: Speed limit did not cut Belfast crashes - study	"Cutting speed limits on urban roads to 20mph does not significantly improve safety, a new report suggests.
Welsh government has said safety is a key reason behind its plans to become the first UK nation to adopt a 20mph default limit in built-up areas.
But a study of 20mph roads in Belfast found ""no statistically significant differences"" in the number of crashes, casualty rates or average speeds.
Welsh government said ""bigger cultural change"" was needed.
Deputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters has said the evidence was ""very clear"" that reducing speed limits saved lives.
He pointed to a study by Edinburgh Napier University and Public Health Wales estimating in the first year of a 20mph limit there would be 19 fewer deaths and 213 fewer people seriously injured on roads.
Many UK towns and cities have 20mph limits on residential roads but from 17 September next year Wales will become the first nation to impose it as the default on all restricted roads - with Scotland set to follow suit in 2025.
move was backed by Labour and Plaid Cymru but opposed by the Welsh Conservatives, who said a blanket rollout would be ""ludicrous"".
A new study published by the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health looked at data from before and after the limit was introduced on 76 roads in central Belfast in 2016.
It found the move had ""little impact on long-term outcomes"" in the city.
Comparisons with nearby 30 or 40mph limit streets in Belfast showed ""no statistically significant differences"" in the number of crashes, casualty rates or average traffic speed.
uthors argued that 20mph limits could be combined with other measures like driver training, CCTV and police communications for ""an ambitious culture change"".
utting limits was ""not simply a road safety intervention"" but can be ""part of the fundamental reset of the way we choose our life priorities - people before cars"".
RAC road safety expert Simon Williams told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast he was ""slightly concerned"" at the findings as they ""seem to go against other findings that have been published over the years"".
uthors of the report noted their research was smaller in scale than some other studies on the topic.
""Twenty is a very sensible speed limit,"" Mr Williams said, ""but it must imply that something must have been going on [in Belfast] and people are just completely disregarding the speed limit.""
He said the new limit will help but there is a ""danger that people will disregard it"".
""Unless it is strongly enforced or some clever road design to slow people down you do find that average speeds drop which is an overall benefit to road safety.""
As well as lowering road crashes, Welsh ministers have previously said 20mph would cut noise and air pollution, and encourage more people to walk or cycle.
wer limit has been divisive in areas with some motorists complaining of more congestion and journeys taking longer.
Welsh government said the findings of the study ""reinforce its approach"" of a ""bigger cultural change"" being needed for 20mph limits to work.
It added: ""We have already seen noticeable reductions in speed across our eight pilot areas."""	/news/uk-wales-63646023
technology	TikTok Now: BeReal-style feature prompts copycat claims	"kTok users have noticed a new feature promising ""a whole new creative experience"" - but they've been quick to question how new it really is.
, called TikTok Now, released in the UK this week, asks users to take a photo or video from their phone's front and back cameras at a random time of day.
kTok has encouraged people to ""share their most authentic moments"".
But many have pointed out that it looks pretty similar to BeReal.
, seen as an alternative to the filtered and curated feeds often associated with social media, has grown rapidly since it was launched by a small French company.
It's currently ninth in Apple's overall UK App Store downloads chart, compared with TikTok's 14th place.
But it has got some catching up to do, with some reports putting its total downloads at about 27 million against TikTok's estimated three billion.
re are some subtle differences between TikTok's offering and BeReal's.
Both will send users a notification at a random time of day, after which they'll have a limited time to snap a photo. TikTok Now also allows for 10-second videos.
BeReal prompts you with the message ""It's time to BeReal"", whereas TikTok has settled on ""It's Time to Now"" for its daily countdown launch.
As for sharing your posts, BeReal is restricted by design - photos are only meant to be seen by a small circle of close friends, in line with the app's low-key attitude.
kTok Now offers users the ability to share their posts with the wider world, although it will be limited to friends by default.
And younger users will have automatic restrictions placed on their posts.
Following TikTok's announcement earlier this year, people were quick to point out that the concept behind TikTok Now looked very familiar.
Others were more direct, accusing it of ""blatantly copying"" its smaller competitor.
xperts leapt on the fact that Instagram had been beaten to the launch, after the company confirmed last month that it was testing Candid Challenges, its own BeReal-style feature.
And industry analyst Matt Navarra said the announcement by ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, was ""shameless and ferociously fast"".
Could my BeReal get me sacked?
Instagram U-turns on TikTok-style revamp
kTok reveals 2022 summer breakout artist
Social media companies have a track record of ""borrowing"" ideas from each other - with varying degrees of success.
Some features we take for granted - Twitter's ""Like"" button, Instagram's Stories and the trend for short, vertical videos - have either inspired imitators or been copied from elsewhere.
For example, Instagram recently rolled back an unpopular TikTok-style revamp that filled people's feeds with videos.
Even celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner weighed in, accusing the app of trying to imitate its rival and urging it to ""make Instagram Instagram again"".
And you might remember Fleets - Twitter's ill-fated attempt to introduce disappearing tweets similar to Instagram's Stories features.
Or you might not. After a backlash, the company quietly retired the feature after just a few months, saying it hadn't ""seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped"".
As for TikTok Now, users in the USA got it first, with the button for the feature replacing the current Friends tab. There are plans to release it as a separate app in some countries.
It remains to be seen whether it will stick around long-term or vanish more quickly than a Vine video.

sports	Usain Bolt: Flawless and untouchable, the triple triple sealed his legend	"When Usain Bolt leaves his sport, it will feel like the moment the lights suddenly come on in a nightclub.
We all know it must come to an end. We have tried to imagine otherwise all the same. Keep dancing along, keep relishing every transcendent moment. One more tune, one more collective rush.
It is time to start packing up the party. After three Olympics when Bolt has illuminated both track and field and the wider world around him, the Games are at last over. 
re will be a final farewell at next summer's World Championships in London, over the 100m at least, but never again will the fastest human in history walk the greatest stage of all.
It made his final Olympic bow here in Rio on this warm Friday evening both a celebration and a sadness, the pleasure of remembering all that has come before tinged with regret that there will be no more.
ree Olympics, three gold medals in each. A world record over 100m, a world record over 200m, a world record in the sprint relay. Through injury, under pressure, from China to London and on to Brazil, as a wide-eyed 21-year-old sensation and a man in maturity whose hair is beginning to thin and hamstrings are starting to pop.
Bolt has changed the game and changed the way we watch it.
re was a time when sprinting was the briefest thrill in town. Snarling on the blocks, narrowed eyes into the camera. Ten seconds of pent-up aggression, a jogged lap of gladiatorial salutation.
Eight years on, it can be hard to remember the surprise of seeing a contender smiling on the blocks, the shock of seeing someone clown around and not look a fool in the serious business that follows.
was only the build-up. Bolt was never the first from the gun. He was seldom the first at halfway, yet always his rivals would then suddenly start to recede as if he were being pulled along on an invisible bungee cord.
rough the line, you learned not to follow him with your eyes for too long. Let them track back instead to the numbers frozen on the electronic scoreboard just inside the track's curb. Often there would be a moment of bewilderment as you registered times that made no sense. 9.5 something? 19.19?
Unlike any other superstar sprinter, unlike Carl Lewis or Michael Johnson, Bolt would then stretch that short into an epic - stopping for every selfie, holding his iconic pose for every photographer, sometimes an hour to complete a full lap when the first quarter had taken him less than 10 seconds.
In the afternoon before his 200m final on Thursday, wondering how the sport would move on unshackled from his unmatched draw, I looked back on how it was before, rewatching the 200m final from the 2004 Olympics, watching the final from four years further back again.
Athens, Shawn Crawford muscling his way through the tape, a man trained by disgraced coach Trevor Graham, an athlete who would end his career with a doping sanction. Close behind him in bronze, Justin Gatlin, another of Graham's dirty dozen, about to be banned for a second time.
Sydney 2000. A failed 400m runner, Kostas Kenteris, coming from obscurity to take a gold no-one had seen coming. Neither would we see him go, slinking into notoriety four years later when staging a motorcycle accident on the eve of his home Olympics to avoid a random drugs test.
where sprinting was as Bolt came from the blue, and where it may have stayed had he never arrived.
By the time of the Beijing Olympics almost every record-breaking sprinter - Justin Gatlin, Marion Jones, Tim Montgomery - had been busted for drugs. Through London he stood clean as his rivals - Tyson Gay, Asafa Powell - went the same way.
He has not escaped entirely from the spreading stain. Powell was back as part of the victorious Jamaican quartet on Friday night. He passed the baton to Yohan Blake, Bolt's sometime training partner, who has also been sanctioned for a doping offence.
He nonetheless stands tall in an era brought low, the only athlete every kid can name, the only superstar who could sell out stadiums on his own.
""Athletics is in such a poor shape that it is unfortunate for him,"" says Johnson, whose 200m record Bolt took.
""It is difficult to really put into perspective his impact, because the sport has done such a poor job of promoting itself and policing itself that Bolt has stood apart from the sport. Good for him, otherwise I think the sport would have dragged him down.""
It can be difficult to recall too that Bolt was not considered a nailed-on favourite in his first Olympic final in Beijing, before the stories of pre-race meals of chicken nuggets and mid-race untied shoelaces had added fresh wonder to the world record that followed.
In the weeks before London 2012 he had been beaten by rivals and doubted by critics. By his own admission he was only 95% fit. Then, at the centrepiece of the biggest sporting occasion on the planet, he ran the second fastest 100m of all time.
mbination of sporting celebrity and sweet speed was why there were one million requests for the 80,000 tickets for that 100m final in Stratford.
It was why he has been paraded round tracks before competitions astride a giant rocket, why a World Championships has been halted so the entire stadium could sing him Happy Birthday, why he has held his trademark 'To Di World' poseexternal-link alongside both a giant anthropomorphic thistle in Scotland and President Obama on the White House lawn.
It is why his Olympic experience includes having a bag-man in the athletes' village to fetch him food, so that he is not mobbed by the weak-kneed stars of other sports as he walks to the canteens, and why when three members of the Swedish women's handball team were photographed in his room in London it became front-page news across the globe.
It is why too he walked out of an Olympic stadium for the final time to the rhythmic cheers of a crowd that didn't want to leave, of a crowd that like so many others across the continents will be telling grandkids for years to come that they saw the best who has ever been do what no man has ever done before.
In a flawed era, Bolt has been flawless. In a yellow vest, unbroken gold. No-one could touch him, from first race to last."	/sport/olympics/37138536
business	US ban on imports from China's Xinjiang region takes effect	"ugh new US regulations on the import of goods from the Xinjiang region of China have come into effect.
Under the rules, firms have to prove imports from the region are not produced using forced labour.
US officials have said members of the minority Uyghur community in the region, who are predominantly Muslim, have been detained and made to work.
China has repeatedly rejected accusations that it is holding Uyghurs in internment camps in Xinjiang.
Several imports from the resource-rich region, including cotton and tomatoes, have already been banned from the US.
restrictions will be extended to all imports under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which took effect on Tuesday.
In a statement late last week, US lawmakers said the law sends ""a clear message that we will no longer remain complicit in the Chinese Communist Party's use of slave labour and egregious crimes against humanity"".
""Congress stands ready to work with President Biden and his administration to ensure this historic law is fully and rigorously implemented,"" US Republican Senator Marco Rubio, Democrat Senator Jeff Merkley and two other lawmakers said.
According to the US Congress, China has detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang since April 2017.
It believes tens of thousands of detainees have worked ""at a fraction of minimum wage or without any compensation"" in Xinjiang and other provinces ""under the guise of poverty alleviation and industrial aid programmes"".
It said China also ""interferes with audits and traditional due diligence efforts to vet goods and supply chains in Xinjiang... including by intimidating potential witnesses and concealing relevant information"".
China has denied the use of forced labour and said the camps in Xinjiang were ""re-education"" facilities used to combat terrorism.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin recently called forced labour accusations ""an out-and-out preposterous lie concocted by certain external forces"".
But leaked files and first-hand accounts from inside the camps, which were obtained by the BBC, have detailed an organised system of mass rape, sexual abuse and torture of ethnic minorities.
Human rights groups have also accused the Chinese government of gradually stripping away the religious and other freedoms of Uyghurs through mass surveillance, detention, indoctrination and even forced sterilisation.
Scott Nova, executive director of the independent Workers Rights Consortium in Washington DC, said the UFLPA ""will likely substantially reduce the practice of forced labour in Xinjiang"" by ""eliminating a large part of the market"" for its goods.
""A crucial question is whether brands selling goods in the US will try to take advantage of the weaker protections in other consumer markets by directing goods with content from Xinjiang to those markets,"" Mr Nova said.
""Our coalition will be working to identify and publicly expose any brands and retailers that engage in this practice,"" he added.
Laura Murphy, a human rights professor at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, said the European Union (EU) should impose a similar import ban on goods from Xinjiang.
""I think that citizens of the EU would be shocked to know that a ban on products known to be made with forced labour does not already exist,"" Prof Murphy said.
""But the EU also needs to be a leader in passing mandatory human rights due diligence. Both these tools are necessary to ensure that companies address the forced labour and other abuses in their supply chains,"" she added.
Japanese retailers Uniqlo and Muji are among brands that have been scrutinised over materials from Xinjiang.
In January last year, the US blocked a shipment of Uniqlo men's shirts over concerns that it violated a ban on cotton products from the region.
Responding to a query from the BBC last week, a Uniqlo spokesperson did not state whether or not the brand uses cotton from Xinjiang.
""We continue to work with [US officials] to implement measures for the smooth importation of our products, and are awaiting new guidelines scheduled for release on 21 June,"" the spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, Japanese retailer Muji has been criticised for launching a collection of Oxford shirts ""made of organic cotton delicately and wholly handpicked in Xinjiang"" in 2019.
A spokesperson at Ryohin Keikaku, which operates the Muji brand, told the BBC it was not currently exporting products from Xinjiang to the US. However, the company declined to comment on whether it was selling products from Xinjiang in other countries.
""In our business activities, we comply with the laws and regulations of each country and region, and we are taking all necessary steps to respect human rights and labour standards,"" the spokesperson said.
Early last year, the administration of former US President Donald Trump announced a ban on cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang.
wider-reaching UFLPA was approved by the Senate last July, and Congress in December. It was subsequently signed into law by current US President Joe Biden.
From Tuesday, US Customs and Border Protection officials will stop all shipments from Xinjiang that arrive at American ports. 
Cargo will be stopped from entering the country unless the importer can ""prove by clear and convincing evidence that the goods were not produced with forced labour,"" the US Department of Homeland Security said.

Hancock has said he is on the show to raise awareness of dyslexia.
Ahead of his entry into the camp in Australia, the former health secretary faced a barrage of criticism for his decision to enter the jungle while serving as an MP. 
Hancock had the Tory whip suspended after his participation in the show was announced. The reaction prompted speculation about the welcome he would receive from his campmates and how he would respond. 
In his first full episode, broadcast on Wednesday, Hancock took a calm and assured approach to his first Bushtucker trial, alongside the more squeamish Seann Walsh.

""I feel like, I don't want to be sitting here like I'm having fun with him [Hancock]. It's difficult for me because, you know, had something happened, if my mum had [died], I wouldn't be here now. I would have gone when he walked in.""
Watch: Boy George in tears over Matt Hancock's participation on reality show
Afterwards, the singer became tearful as he explained: ""I don't want to spoil this experience for myself. I'm not good at hiding what I feel, especially when it's something so strong."" 
Coronation Street actress Sue Cleaver told Hancock he was ""a brave man"" for taking part in the show after earlier saying she was speechless following his entrance.
Others said they were prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt.
""To be fair, everyone's human. We all have our own personalities outside how we are seen in the media,"" said Douglas.
Asked again why he had joined the show, Hancock replied: ""Why? Because, all politicians are known - and me in particular - for being in a very sort of strict way of being. Which is just not actually how we are."" 
Hancock's early interactions with other contestants were cordial. 
""Please just say, 'next slide please' and I'll be really happy,"" radio host Chris Moyles said to him, referring to Hancock's press conference appearances during lockdown.
Hancock obliged, but later Moyles commented: ""I can't help but think he should be at work.""
Viewers who had been growing impatient for the MP's arrival would have been satisfied with Wednesday's instalment of the ITV reality series.
Hancock was seen being told he will have to act as a mole for a secret task, as he and Walsh settled in for three weeks of eating insects and sharing their outdoor accommodation with snakes.  
While contestants such as football star Jill Scott and rugby player Mike Tindall have been seen in nightly episodes since Sunday, Walsh and Hancock were held back.
Before meeting the other contestants, the pair discussed whether either of them had ever cooked over a fire before (neither had).
But it was Hancock's question about Walsh's tattoo, which references rock band Blink 182, that prompted his first memorable and meme-able moment of the series. 
Asked by Walsh about his own musical taste, Hancock revealed it was ""quite mainstream... but I'm not going to put a tattoo of Ed Sheeran on my neck."" Hancock then  performed a rendition of the singer's hit song Perfect, as social media users inevitably rushed to clip the moment up to share.
Both Walsh and Hancock have joined the show with reputations to restore.
Walsh hopes to overcome the controversy that surrounded his appearance on Strictly Come Dancing in 2018, when he was photographed kissing his professional dance partner despite having a long-term girlfriend.
Hancock, meanwhile, is keen to show a different side of himself to the public, who remember him losing his cabinet job after breaking social distancing guidelines by kissing a colleague during the Covid-19 pandemic.
His team has stressed that Hancock plans to use his time in the jungle to raise awareness for his dyslexia campaign, although whether any of that will actually make it on air is another matter. 
While Hancock has said he is ""looking forward to throwing myself into [the show] like I do everything in life"", he will also maintain some contact with his team in the UK.
He was given access to a laptop during his isolation, allowing him to continue working and to stay in touch with constituents.
44-year-old was criticised by fellow MPs and constituents for signing up outside of a Parliamentary recess. He was suspended as a Tory MP and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was ""disappointed"" in his decision to participate.
But in terms of the sheer amount of publicity he brings to the show, Hancock has already done his job for ITV. Even before entering the jungle, the acres of column inches and hours of airtime which were dedicated to his participation were the kind of publicity money cannot buy.
As a result, and perhaps aware that the public were becoming restless following his absence from the first three episodes, ITV launched Hancock and Walsh straight into a bushtucker trial as soon as they arrived in camp.
Beastly Burrows required Hancock to crawl through a series of pitch-black tunnels and chambers, while having buckets of slime and insects poured over him, in order to win meals for the camp that night. 
Walsh was considerably jumpier and more squeamish than Hancock, saying ahead of the challenge that he felt ""petrified"".
gether, the pair managed to find six of a possible 11 stars. Hancock admirably kept his composure while insects and slurry was poured on him from above, prompting Walsh to ask: ""How are you so relaxed?!""
ge served as a possible indication that viewers looking forward to seeing Hancock squirm his way through trials for the next three weeks may be disappointed. "	/news/entertainment-arts-63558418

technology	Bournemouth DVD rental store Flicks closes after 40 years	"A DVD store that has rented films for almost 40 years is closing its doors, unable to compete with online streaming sites. 
Flicks in Bournemouth, Dorset, started out in the mid-1980s, when VHS machines were the height of technology. 
DVDs and videos from the shop will be sold off and any films left boxed up are set to be put into storage. 
Manager Terry Whitaker said one of his suppliers told him there were as few as 10 DVD rental shops left in the UK now.
He said he liked remembering the ""good old days"" but people ""watch films differently now"". 
When Flicks first opened VHS machines were still in use but DVDs soon took over and now streaming sites rule.
Mr Whitaker began working at the store 27 years ago.
""When I started it was part-time, then two years became 10, then 20,"" he said. ""But it never felt like work, I've always enjoyed it here.
""I found some old VHS machines, they're heavy, bulky things, and we kept a stash of the original Star Wars trilogy hidden away. I also found two old Braveheart posters,"" the 50-year-old said. 
""With a movie like Crocodile Dundee, people used to have to wait for it to come out on video, then they'd have to reserve it. Pretty Woman was the same. 
""You wouldn't just walk in on the day it was released, you'd have to book or pre-book it before it even came out. 
""Those were the good old days.""
Mr Whitaker said streaming had made watching films ""less of an occasion, definitely"". 
""Back then, you'd come in as a family and pick a film each and sit round, have the build up and watch it as a family and eat popcorn.
""But people just watch films differently now, on iPads, phones - people will have two TVs in their homes so they'll watch movies separately now"", he said. 
re manager said he ""wasn't too sure"" what he would do once the store closed for good. 
""I've got a couple of months to close down the company yet, then I'll find something else,"" he said.
""My favourite movie of all time? It changes, but the constant is Dances With Wolves.""

On the final day, Pearson and Wilson won silver and bronze respectively in their Grade 2 freestyle tests.
Baker was third in the Grade 3 event while Wells took Grade 5 bronze.
Pearson and his horse Breezer scored 78.860% to finish behind Denmark's Katrine Kristensen who managed 80.354%, with Wilson on 75.834% 
""It's remarkable. I was quite adamant I wouldn't win gold so, to me, the silver is my gold here today,"" said 14-time Paralympic champion Pearson.
""He has got spectacular trot work, but we are aware that the walk needs to be more supple, even when he's relaxed, and with the great audiences that we've had, that just tightens his walk a little bit.

""I'm very grateful for being here. It's also felt like a fierce competition, which has been good.""
Despite finishing fourth in the team event behind the Netherlands, Denmark and the USA, the first time GB have not featured on the podium in nearly 30 years of competition, it was still enough to secure the team's spot at the next Paralympics.

health	Base editing: Revolutionary therapy clears girl's incurable cancer	"A teenage girl's incurable cancer has been cleared from her body in the first use of a revolutionary new type of medicine. 
All other treatments for Alyssa's leukaemia had failed.  
So doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital used ""base editing"" to perform a feat of biological engineering to build her a new living drug.
Six months later the cancer is undetectable, but Alyssa is still being monitored in case it comes back. 
Alyssa, who is 13 and from Leicester, was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in May last year. 
-cells are supposed to be the body's guardians - seeking out and destroying threats - but for Alyssa they had become the danger and were growing out of control. 
Her cancer was aggressive. Chemotherapy, and then a bone-marrow transplant, were unable to rid it from her body. 
Without the experimental medicine, the only option left would have been merely to make Alyssa as comfortable as possible. 
""Eventually I would have passed away,"" said Alyssa. Her mum, Kiona, said this time last year she had been dreading Christmas, ""thinking this is our last with her"". And then she ""just cried"" through her daughter's 13th birthday in January. 
What happened next would have been unthinkable just a few years ago and has been made possible by incredible advances in genetics. 
m at Great Ormond Street used a technology called base editing, which was invented only six years ago. 
Bases are the language of life. The four types of base - adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) - are the building blocks of our genetic code. Just as letters in the alphabet spell out words that carry meaning, the billions of bases in our DNA spell out the instruction manual for our body. 
Base editing allows scientists to zoom to a precise part of the genetic code and then alter the molecular structure of just one base, converting it into another and changing the genetic instructions. 
rge team of doctors and scientists used this tool to engineer a new type of T-cell that was capable of hunting down and killing Alyssa's cancerous T-cells. 
rted with healthy T-cells that came from a donor and set about modifying them.
final stage of genetic modification instructed the T-cells to go hunting for anything with the CD7 marking on it so that it would destroy every T-cell in her body - including the cancerous ones. That's why this marking has to be removed from the therapy - otherwise it would just destroy itself.  
If the therapy works, Alyssa's immune system - including T-cells - will be rebuilt with the second bone-marrow transplant.
When the idea was explained to the family, mum Kiona was left thinking: ""You can do that?"" It was Alyssa's decision to be the first to take the experimental therapy - which contained millions of the modified cells - in May this year.
""She's the first patient to be treated with this technology,"" said Prof Waseem Qasim, from UCL and Great Ormond Street. 
He said this genetic manipulation was a ""very fast-moving area of science"" with ""enormous potential"" across a range of diseases. 
Alyssa was left vulnerable to infection, as the designer cells attacked both the cancerous T-cells in her body and those that protect her from disease. 
After a month, Alyssa was in remission and was given a second bone-marrow transplant to regrow her immune system. 
Alyssa spent 16 weeks in hospital and couldn't see her brother, who was still going to school, in case he brought germs in. 
re were worries after the three-month check-up found signs of the cancer again. But her two most recent investigations have been clear. 
""You just learn to appreciate every little thing. I'm just so grateful that I'm here now,"" said Alyssa. 
""It's crazy. It's just amazing I've been able to have this opportunity, I'm very thankful for it and it's going to help other children, as well, in the future.""
She's eyeing-up Christmas, being a bridesmaid at her auntie's wedding, getting back on her bike, going back to school and ""just doing normal people stuff"".
family hope the cancer will never return, but are already grateful for the time it has bought them. 
""To have this extra year, this last three months when she's been home, has been a gift in itself,"" said Kiona.
Dad James said: ""I find it quite hard to talk about how proud we are. When you see what she's gone through and her vitality of life she's brought to every situation, it's outstanding.""
Most children with a leukaemia respond to the main treatments, but it is thought that up to a dozen a year could benefit from this therapy.
Alyssa is just the first of 10 people to be given the drug as part of a clinical trial. 
Dr Robert Chiesa, from the bone-marrow transplant department at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: ""It is extremely exciting. Obviously, this is a new field in medicine and it's fascinating that we can redirect the immune system to fight cancer.""
gy, though, only scratches the surface of what base editing could achieve.
Dr David Liu, one of the inventors of base editing at the Broad Institute, told me it was ""a bit surreal"" that people were being treated just six years after the technology was invented. 
In Alyssa's therapy, each of the base edits involved breaking a section of genetic code so it no longer worked. But there are more nuanced applications where instead of switching an instruction off you can fix a defective one. Sickle-cell anaemia, for example, is caused by just one base change that could be corrected.
So there are already trials of base editing under way in sickle-cell disease, as well as high cholesterol that runs in families and the blood disorder beta-thalassemia.
Dr Liu said the ""therapeutic applications of base editing are just beginning"" and it was ""humbling to be part of this era of therapeutic human gene editing"", as science was now taking ""key steps towards taking control of our genomes"".

health	NHS: Londonderry nurse's 'life-changing' move to private sector	"A Londonderry nurse has described how leaving the NHS for the private sector in 2020 has been ""life-changing"".
Karla Mullan is one of 788 nurses who have left the Western Trust since April 2020, BBC Radio Foyle has learned.  
40-year-old said that although she loved her profession, it had become unconducive to family life. 
She was speaking as nurses in NI, England and Wales prepare to strike over pay in what is set to be their biggest walkout in the NHS's history.
Ms Mullan began working in Altnagelvin Hospital in 2006 and stressed that she ""adored"" her job in the early years. 
""I remember the first day, I ran over to laundry to get my blue uniform, I was just so proud to be a nurse,"" she said.
But in more recent times, the mother-of-three found nursing to be an increasingly pressurised profession that was not conducive to family life and she often found it difficult to unwind on days off. 
""In the trust, even on my days off, I'd be taking calls. Nurses take the brunt of everything. They work hard, long hours and their patient care comes first, sometimes they take that home with them to their families. They can't just switch off.""
In August 2020, Ms Mullan was approached by a private healthcare manager who offered her more flexible work which was also better paid. 
""He was able to accommodate my family life. He offered me shifts that worked around my children and their needs,"" she added. 
In a statement, the Western Trust said 203 permanent and temporary nurses have left over the past eight months ""for a variety of reasons including resignation, retirement, end of fixed-term contract, ill health or termination"". 
Between April 2021 and April this year, 323 nurses left the trust. 
As well as her care-home work, Ms Mullan now also has the time to run a part-time aesthetics business and her childcare costs have reduced significantly as her children only need to attend a childminder once a week.
""It just gives me so much more flexibility and made family life easier, not juggling shifts and childcare. It's just less stressful,"" she said.
""And now I don't have the guilt, it's been life-changing. As nurses we put our profession before our children at times. It's not flexible for mothers and fathers.
""The pressure comes from trying to balance your work life and family life. I have that now."" 
She is really enjoying working in a care home too.
""The elderly are so lovely to care for, they have lovely stories. I feel like I've adopted 24 grannies and granddas,"" she added.  
A 2022 report by the Nuffield Trust concluded that although retirement was the most common reason for departures, work-life balance is now the second most common reason for leaving a role.
It suggested the numbers citing this reason are now nearly four times higher than a decade ago. It also stated numbers leaving due to health reasons have also nearly quadrupled.
""Nursing is the single largest profession in the NHS, but it suffers from substantial staffing shortages,"" the report stated. 
Last month, the BBC found NHS bosses are increasingly paying premium rates for agency staff to plug holes in rotas. 
Ms Mullan can see the appeal of agency work, particularly among young nurses who may have fewer family commitments.
""You'd see people leave, but then they'd be back in a different uniform, earning more money as agency,"" she said.
""It's not good for morale. They really should look after the staff that are there - pay them the double time if they want to do extra hours. 
""There are lots of agencies out there and they seem to be looking after their staff very well.
""I can see why they would go and then they have the opportunity of going to a different trust or they can go into private healthcare. There are so many different doors."" "	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63879580
health	Assisted dying: 'I was arrested for taking someone to Dignitas'	"A retired NHS worker spent 19 hours in custody and was investigated by police for six months for chaperoning a woman to her assisted death in Switzerland.
Sue Lawford went with Sharon Johnston, who was in a wheelchair after a fall left her paralysed, to Dignitas from her home in mid Wales.
70-year-old said police, who arrested her the day after returning from Switzerland, were ""aggressive"".
Dyfed-Powys Police said assisting a suicide was a criminal offence.
force said a ""thorough criminal investigation"" was required to establish the facts but added that the case has been closed and no-one will face charges.
British law states anyone who is said to have encouraged or assisted the suicide or attempted suicide of another person can be jailed for up to 14 years.
Baroness Ilora Finlay, a former Royal Society of Medicine president and professor of palliative care, said the law must protect vulnerable people.
Ms Johnson, 60, who had no immediate family following the death of her parents and brother, went to Switzerland to die six months after the former pub landlady and betting shop worker told a BBC TV programme she planned to spend Â£14,000 to end her life.
Mrs Lawford, a retired GP surgery manager, did not know Sharon and only met her once before they travelled, but agreed to help her as a member of group My Death, My Decision, which supports changes to the UK law on assisted dying.
Retired NHS worker Sue Lawford spent 19 hours in custody
Mrs Lawford admitted ""it wasn't the easiest decision"" to help Ms Johnson, a tetraplegic, get to Dignitas but she said she ""couldn't hand on heart come up with a good enough reason to say I wouldn't help"".
Ms Johnston travelled from her home in Cardigan, Ceredigion, in a disabled taxi to London's Heathrow Airport on 14 February for the journey to Dignitas, picking up Ms Lawford in Cardiff on the way.
""Sharon was so rational, pragmatic and down to earth about the whole thing,"" said Mrs Lawford.
""She had been getting rid of stuff to the charity shops and things like that. There was this feeling that it was all quite imminent.""
But not long after they set off, Ms Johnson received her first call from police. Mrs Lawford said she believed the carers who went to Sharon's home four times a day had reported her missing. 
She said she thought Mrs Johnston received two calls from the police and one from social services on the journey to the airport, each time Mrs Johnston told the authorities that she was OK. 
Ceredigion council has said it would not comment on individual cases but Mrs Lawford said those calls were ""stressful"".
""We didn't really talk about it in the taxi but I think we both felt that any minute we would see a blue light and we would be stopped on the motorway,""  she added.
""She was worried that she wouldn't be able to go through with it.""
Once they arrived at Dignitas, Ms Johnston was assessed by a doctor and psychiatrist on whether she was able to make a rational decision about ending her life.
But Mrs Lawford said armed police then turned up.
""There was a knock on the door and looking out through the blinds, we could see it was the Swiss police,"" she added.
""The police here had asked the Swiss police to intervene. So more stress for Sharon. It was extremely upsetting and frightening.
""The police were very business-like but Swiss police are armed for a start, and it's not something we are used to seeing in this country.
""They were perfectly polite and asked lots of questions, both separately and together. I can only assume that they were reassured. 
""Sharon was very calm and rational and the police eventually left and must have reported back to the police in the UK.""
following day, Ms Johnston ended her life at the clinic and Mrs Lawford returned home.
She was woken early the following morning at about 05:30 GMT by banging on her front door.  
""The dog went absolutely berserk,"" Mrs Lawford recalled. ""My husband and I nearly jumped out of our skins. He went down to answer the door and just called up and said 'Sue you better come down, it's the police'.""
As she stood in her pyjamas, Mrs Lawford was told she was being arrested and said an officer led her to a police van and made her sit in the cage at the back.
She said she was held for a total of 19 hours, 16 of them in a police cell, before being told that she was being released under investigation.
Dyfed-Powys Police said: ""It is a criminal offence in the UK to encourage or assist in the suicide or attempted suicide of another person. 
""The circumstances of such cases increase the risk of vulnerable people being exploited and others making financial gain,"" the force said a statement.
""A thorough criminal investigation is required to establish the facts of each case, requiring action to secure evidence that may be lost as time passes and prevent opportunities to dispose of relevant evidence. 
""Following such an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Sharon Johnston the matter has been closed.""
Officers have said the two people who were arrested as part of the investigation have been told they ""face no further action"".
figures from prosecutors suggested just four cases of assisted suicide have been prosecuted in the UK, with the majority not leading to charges.
Mrs Lawford will speak at an event in Westminster Hall on Tuesday organised by My Death, My Decision, which wants the law changed so that people ""of sound mind"" who are ""terminally ill or incurably suffering"" can be allowed to end their own lives.
f assisted dying has been debated in Parliament numerous times and the latest Assisted Dying Bill, which proposed allowing terminally ill adults to be helped to end their own life, was discussed in its second House of Lords reading last year but failed to make it to law.
Campaigners against the proposed change raised concerns it could leave some patients vulnerable to coercion.
Cardiff cancer hospital consultant Baroness Finlay worried that once implemented legislation could expand to include the disabled, children, the mentally ill or those suffering trauma.
She said: ""If you are considering legislation you must think who are you putting at risk.""
She added she thought it was ""dangerous"" to put doctors in a position where they could end lives and added they should be working to improve, not shorten them. 
""The role of the law has to be to protect everyone who is vulnerable and it has to look to protect the most vulnerable from being pressurised into things that they should somehow end their lives,"" she said.
""That is the law at the moment and the director of public prosecutions has very clear guidance as to which cases should be pursued and which shouldn't.
""Sadly there are always people who, at a time of something awful happening, feel complete despair.
""But we know that with appropriate support and help, they come out the other side and often can live very well and go on to be glad that they are still alive. It is too dangerous to licence a doctor to provide lethal drugs to their patients."" 
Assisted dying has been decriminalised in several European countries, including Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands while a bill to legalise assisted dying has now been introduced in Scotland, which could bring about changes next year.
British Medical Association has now moved to a position of neutrality on assisted dying. 
MPs last voted on changes to the right to die in England and Wales in 2015 and the UK government said any change to the law ""in an area of such sensitivity and importance"" is for individual MPs to consider rather than government.
""Our sympathies remain with the families and loved ones affected by these deeply upsetting cases,"" the Ministry of Justice added.
Mrs Lawford said she understands the police were doing their job when they questioned her but feels the law should change - and hopes she is never asked to accompany anyone on a trip like this again.
""I have not actually talked about it to many people but when I do I don't sleep very well for a couple of nights."" she said. ""It is a massive thing.""

Apple reveals iPhone 14 Pro and Watch Ultra
Apple Watch Series 8 has a number of new features, including car crash detection, temperature sensors for tracking ovulation cycles and a new low-power mode option.
People have been cautious about menstrual trackers since changes were made to abortion legislation in the US and there are concerns that data about periods could be used by law enforcement. Apple says the data on its devices will be encrypted and only accessible via a passcode or biometrics. 
""We are taking our commitment to women's health even further,"" said Jeff Williams, chief operating officer at Apple.
Apple said a new automatic retrospective ovulation notification could help those who are trying to conceive. 
If activated, the new watch can monitor body temperate every five seconds overnight, and detect tiny changes which can signal ovulation. 
Another new feature is car crash detection. Using sensors, the watch will be able to identify a severe crash and will automatically connect its wearer with emergency services, provide their exact location and notify emergency contacts. 
Series 8 now also features a low power mode, a feature borrowed from the iPhone, that promises up to 36 hours of battery life on a full charge.
Apple Watch Series 8 is priced from $399 in the US, Â£419 in the UK.
Swim-proof, dust-proof and crack-resistant - Apple has announced its rival to the likes of Garmin, Polar and other rugged watchmakers. 
Ultramarathoner Scott Jurek from Born to Run appeared in the presentation for the new watch, which focused on a larger face design for extreme sports use.
All Ultra watches have up to 36 hours battery life on a single charge and an extended battery life of 60 hours, with Apple promising enough power for its customers to complete an ultra-triathlon which includes swimming, cycling and running. 
Apple Watch Ultra is priced from $799 in the US, Â£849 in the UK.
mpany is releasing the iPhone 14 in two sizes, the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus.
w handsets are capable of sending an emergency call for help via satellite. The phone will display the whereabouts of passing satellites overhead and demonstrate how to point the device at them correctly. 
It can take from 15 seconds to a few minutes to send a basic message.
""The investment to add satellite capability should not be underestimated,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. 
""It will likely have taken Apple years to put all the pieces of the puzzle in place, including a commercial agreement with satellite provider Globalstar, and the creation of the infrastructure needed to pass messages to the emergency services.""

Being here in person, among an enthusiastic crowd of Apple fans, certainly made for a more interesting launch than recent years. But nothing was announced today that is going to revolutionise the tech industry.
Much of Apple's new tech seems ideal if you find yourself in some kind of peril on a regular basis.  The new iPhone 14 will be able to send texts by satellite when off the grid. The Ultra Watch design is chunky with extra-long battery life - the company says this is perfect for multi-day remote trips. Apple also announced a new crash detection system on new watches and phones, which will alert the emergency services when it detects an impact. The strategy here is pretty clear. Apple is continuing to pitch its hardware as a health and safety aid. Not surprisingly, Tim Cook describes the products as ""essential"".

technology	New EU law could open up messaging and app buying	"New rules designed to rein in the dominance of big tech companies are coming into force in the EU.
Under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), technology giants such as Google and Apple could be made to open up their services and platforms to other firms and developers.
Messaging apps, for example, could be required to work with smaller rival applications.
gislation will not apply in the UK because of Brexit.
In the European Union, the act will change the rules for companies of large size and influence - the so-called gatekeeper firms.
But some of the larger firms have expressed concern about the DMA's potential impact on security and innovation.
Under the DMA, smaller messaging apps will be able to ask the tech gatekeepers to allow their users to send and receive messages via the bigger firm's platform.
However, large firms will not be required to make more advanced features interoperable immediately.  Under the plans, audio and video calls between two individual users or groups of end users on different platforms will not happen for four years.
rger firms may also be required to allow their users to chose different app stores.
Speaking to tech news website Wired, Gerard de Graaf, an EU official cited the example of an iPhone user, who should ""now be able to download apps not just from the App Store but from other app stores or from the internet"".
European Commission has also released a video explaining the purpose of the act.
BEUC - which represents many European consumer organisations - called the act ""a landmark law for the EU's digital transformation.
""This legislation will rebalance digital markets, increase consumer choice and put an end to many of the worst practices that big tech has engaged in over the years,"" it said.
It gave two examples of changes under the DMA:
But it said it was crucial member states gave the commission the resources it would need to enforce the new act.
DMA now moves into a six month implementation phase and will start to apply on 2 May 2023.
Margrethe Vestager, the commissioner for competition, who originally proposed the legislation said: ""We invite all potential gatekeepers, their competitors or consumer organisations, to come and talk to us about how to best implement the DMA.""
me specific gatekeepers, with the the commission aiming to decide which companies will fall under its remit at the latest by 6 September 2023.
But it says gatekeepers will be companies that meet criteria in terms of financial size and numbers of users and have an ""entrenched and durable"" position in the market.
Companies that do not comply with the DMA could face fines of up to 10% of their annual worldwide turnover for the first infringement and up to 20% for repeated rule breaking.
DMA imposes a number of obligations on firms identified as gatekeepers including:
Apple has previously said it was ""concerned that some provisions of the DMA will create unnecessary privacy and security vulnerabilities for our users"".
Google has said: ""While we support many of the DMA's ambitions around consumer choice and interoperability, we're worried that some of these rules could reduce innovation and the choice available to Europeans.""
While the rules will only apply in the EU, a committee of UK MPs recently urged the government to publish the draft Competition, Consumer and Digital Markets Bill which aims to provide regulators with new tools to tackle anti-competitive behaviour by big tech firms."	/news/technology-63458377

politics	Bilsdale mast: Sunak told TV signal to be restored by spring	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said he has been assured TV and radio services will be restored to hundreds of people in the North of England by spring. 
Households in Teesside, County Durham and North Yorkshire were left without reception when the Bilsdale transmitter caught fire in August 2021.
Arqiva declined to give a date for when the replacement mast would be installed and apologised for the delay. 
Richmond MP Mr Sunak was visiting Chop Gate, near the site of the transmitter. 
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), he said: ""The fire at Bilsdale transmitter in August last year caused significant difficulties for many of my constituents, many of them elderly, who rely on broadcast television and radio services to watch and listen to their favourite programmes.
""While the vast majority of constituents did have their service restored shortly after the fire, I am pleased to receive reassurance that plans for the full restoration of these services are on track for spring 2023.""
Most people affected have been able to access services as temporary masts and relay stations have been put in place, but there are still hundreds of residents going without. 
Apologising for the delay, Arqiva chief executive Shuja Khan said: ""We're sorry for the ongoing disruption caused by the fire at our Bilsdale mast.
""The Arqiva team has been in close and regular contact with Mr Sunak since the fire, to provide help and guidance to those who were experiencing problems with their service as a result and we have now restored some services to more than 99.5% of those affected.""
He said the incident had highlighted ""the value that the public put on the TV and radio services that they get through an aerial"".
Arqiva estimates it will have spent in excess of Â£40m including viewer support, replacement services and the rebuilding of the main mast.
North Yorkshire County Council's Independent group leader Councillor Stuart Parsons said many people, especially in the Upper Dales, did not have the services they had before the fire and that many others were regularly having to retune to get a signal.
He said: ""It is surprising that Rishi Sunak appears to think everything is fine as he is not having to struggle with the problems his constituents are struggle with. It certainly isn't as rosey as he would like to portray it. Even for those of us that have Freeview restored it is not a constant service.""

business	Retail sales fall at fastest rate since lockdown	"Retail sales are falling at a rate ""not seen since the depths of the pandemic"", as price rises hit household budgets, a UK retail body has said.
Shoppers are cutting back on white goods such as fridges and dishwashers as well as opting for cheaper brands, the British Retail Consortium added.
Sales in shops and online have dropped for three months in a row, figures from the BRC and accountants KPMG indicate.
Prices in the UK are currently rising at their fastest rate for 40 years.
Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 9.1% in May, with the increasing cost of food, energy bills and fuel putting pressure on households' finances.
Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said people were cutting back on spending ""against a backdrop of unprecedented price rises on the High Street"".
He said online shopping had continued to drop, with total sales down 9%. The biggest falls have been for purchases of furniture, home appliances and computing.  
Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC said: ""While the Jubilee [bank holiday] weekend gave food sales a temporary boost, and fashion sales benefited from the summer holiday and wedding season, this was not enough to counter the substantial slowdown in consumer spending.""
reased by 1% in the five weeks between 29 May and 2 July 2022, against an increase of 10.4% in June 2021, figures from the BRC and KPMG show. It followed declines in April and May.
Food inflation meanwhile, could reach 15% this summer according to forecasts by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD), meaning shoppers will be paying more for their essential groceries. 
IGD chief executive, Susan Barratt said: ""Shopping habits are changing; some 60% of shoppers are now spending time to save money - up from 55% in March."" 
""With record petrol prices, being able to walk to a grocery store is also increasingly important,"" she added, ""with 27% of shoppers agreeing this is a driver of store choice, compared to 24% in May.""
utback in spending on white goods reported by the BRC's survey comes just days after online electricals retailer AO World said it was seeking to raise about Â£40m.

politics	Tory leadership: Why would anyone want to be prime minister now anyway?	"Why on earth would anyone - especially those seeking to lead the Conservative Party - want to be prime minister? 
Well, you get a fancy Georgian house in central London, hundreds of staff, private travel and a chat with the King every week. 
You even get the chance to do some good and improve people's lives. And whatever happens you'll have a place in history.
But why, right now, would anyone in their right mind put themselves through a leadership election so they can get the top job? 
When I asked this question of an experienced former Downing Street staffer the answer comes: ""I honestly could not answer it.""
At the top of the gruesome list of issues that awaits the next prime minister is that the UK economy is in trouble. 
untry has been getting poorer and the public are feeling it - or as one cabinet minister says: ""We have all the same problems we have before and there is an economic crisis.""
Why has Liz Truss resigned as prime minister? Leila Nathoo explains.
mess created by the short-lived Truss administration has tied the Conservatives to the trouble. Her decisions, and the subsequent ditching of them, singled the UK out for particularly brutal treatment at the hands of the financial markets. 
Families and firms may find it harder to make ends meet and many of them will blame the Tories for the financial pain on its way. 
And whoever ends up in No 10 will have less money in real terms to allocate to public services.  
NHS is seriously stretched, as are services for older people and those with disabilities. Education is struggling to catch up after Covid. 
ransport is creaking, and there are stubborn problems with building houses, as well as the challenges of climate change and energy supply. 
At the risk of depressing you, the list could go on and on. 
Any one of these challenges would be enough to occupy a government's political focus. 
But it's naÃ¯ve to imagine the squeeze on public budgets that is coming won't make it harder for many government departments to do the job the public needs them to do. 
re is a reason that the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, says there will be ""difficult decisions"". Cuts are coming, not least because inflation is so high. 
Away from home, there is no question of the UK reneging on its support for Ukraine - but there are no answers yet about how long the war will go on, or how it ends. 
How should the UK and its allies deal with China? And the row with the EU about the Irish border rumbles on as the unfinished business of Brexit. 
On paper the new prime minister should have the political ability to start solving those problems because, by historic proportions, the Conservatives have a huge majority in Parliament. 
But thanks to the Tories' internal squabbles and horrors that majority is, in truth, hypothetical. ""The party is ungovernable,"" says a cabinet minister.
where the personalities of the candidates vying to the next prime minister come in (sorry, I know some of you wish it wasn't about the characters but it's just part of the deal). 
One of the biggest personalities belongs to Boris Johnson - forced from office this summer by his colleagues.
However, there was a chunk of Tory MPs who stood clapping - some on the verge of weeping - when he left office and who are convinced he is the answer now. 
One of his cabinet backers says ""it was existential for us in 2019, and it is existential for us now"" - joking that they are ""plotting the biggest come back since Lazarus"".
usands of column inches have already been devoted to whether that is a good idea, or even feasible. Let's say it came to pass. There would be horror among many of his colleagues, and profound awkwardness for those MPs, including many of his then-backers, who called publicly for him to go. 
One former minister worries: ""Half the party will be upset and 90% of the country will be upset.""
Another MP says: ""I keep thinking I'm in a never-ending nightmare, then I realise that I actually am. I keep asking my colleagues if they are having memory loss.""
Boris Johnson is without question the biggest political celebrity around. But many of his colleagues believe now it's infamy, not admiration. 
He couldn't keep the party together under his leadership last time, so why is there a chance he will now? Lazarus may have been raised from the dead, according to the Bible, but it was suggested he never smiled again. 
But there is an equivalent risk for former Chancellor Rishi Sunak - who is likely to end up as the MPs' favourite. 
Some blame him for Mr Johnson's downfall and may never fully accept him as the leader if he wins, with one source warning: ""There is a significant part of the Conservative Party that will not serve under Rishi.""
Sunak and Johnson camps are a cracked mirror of each other - both would likely find it hard to bring the party together, leading to what one cabinet minister calls a ""never-ending circle of arguments"". 
, by the way, is where Penny Mordaunt's backers believe she could win - free of the toxic baggage, and able to pull the party together as a team captain who could lead. 
What is Johnson up to?
While I'm writing this, we don't yet know if Boris Johnson is actually going to stand. You won't be surprised to learn this is a classic Boris Johnson move. 
His allies are convinced he wants to do it. Some of his colleagues and superfans are cockahoop that he wants to do it. But he is not confirming he will do it. Why?
Until he is sure he will get the numbers to avoid being humiliated by not making the final cut he would rather dangle the possibility, and perhaps enjoy the attention, than confirm he will stand. 
If he does not get into the final two he can say ""ah ha, well I never said I would stand, thank you for the kind suggestion, but I never really meant it, it's not the right time"". 
But it's not clear that being loathed by no-one will translate into being liked enough.
And then there are the polls. The Tories' ratings have fallen off a cliff. Could they climb back? Of course, anything is possible. 
But the polls suggest disaster, not just a dip, and superhuman leadership will be required to make a full recovery from this.  
ublic, quite rightly, often gets on with more interesting things than what's going on at Westminster, but this time the public has noticed and for the most part largely disapproves of what the Conservatives have been doing.  
So why would anyone want the job? 
's politics. The mixture of the high-minded call to serve and the low lust of of ambition. 
Or as one former senior minister says: ""There is always someone in the Tory Party who believes that they are the one who can lead everyone to the promised land.""

sports	Dame Kelly Holmes: Cypriot radio, a lucky loo & pain - the inside story of 2004's double gold	"It started with a song.
At Athens 2004, Dame Kelly Holmes became only the third woman in history and the first Briton since Albert Hill 84 years earlier to win the 800m and 1500m Olympic double. This is how she did it.
One played by an unknown Cypriot radio DJ.
We were on the island for our pre-Olympics holding camp ahead of Athens 2004 and it was unlike any holding camp I had ever experienced before.
In the build-up to the previous six major championships, I always had an injury. Before Atlanta in 1996 I had picked up a stress fracture. Going into Sydney 2000, I had ripped a 12cm tear in my calf muscle.
But in Cyprus , I felt amazing. My track times were well ahead of schedule, I was eating more than ever before, but still losing weight while getting stronger. The whole combination was coming right.
But doing both the 800m and 1500m was still a massive risk.
My dream since I had been a 14-year-old girl was to be the Olympic 1500m champion. 
king on the extra workload of running the 800m event before could wreck that, setting me a schedule of six world-class races in a little over a week.
I still hadn't decided what to do as we were driving down to the track for the final session of the camp.
In the car were performance director Zara Hyde Peters and my training partner Anthony Whiteman. I joked to them that I really needed to hear Tina Turner's Simply the Best right now.
Immediately, on the Cypriot radio on the car stereo, those familiar opening chords started playing. 
We were all silent and the hairs went up on the back of my neck. It felt like a sign.
For that final session, all I had to do was two 400m laps, as fast as I could, with 10 minutes rest in between.
I knew the times I wanted and I smashed them to bits.
I was 34. I knew I was never going to be in this shape again this close to the Games. I knew I had to go for it.
Once I arrived in Greece, another song proved key.
Alicia Keys' If I Ain't Got you is not your typical warm-up song. It is a slow ballad rather than high-tempo beats. 
But it was the one I listened to before every race at that Games because the lyrics summed up my mindset - fame, fortune, and anything else didn't mean anything if I didn't come home with the medals.
It was just one part of my carefully planned routine.
I would leave for the track at exactly the same time every race day. I would warm up in exactly the same place. I would wear the same Team GB dog-tag necklace.
It was strategy as well as superstition though. With my workload, my nutrition would have to be perfect to carry my body through the 800m-1500m double.
I wanted to start eating as soon as I could after every race, but you can't do exactly what you want as an athlete. There are certain obligations and protocols you have to go through.
As soon as you finish each race, you have to run a gauntlet of television, radio and written press. The whole media run could take 40 minutes, maybe more.
Fortunately I had an inside agent. Sally Gunnell, the former World and Olympic champion hurdler, was doing post-race interviews for the BBC. She would be the first person I would see after each race. 
And, after graciously agreeing to my texted plea for help, she would also come to the track each day with my pack of cashew nuts to hand over and help me get some calories straight on board.
It all ran like clockwork. Except once.
Before the 1500m final, the officials were calling for the athletes to come out on track. I had one last task: my now-traditional trip to the same portaloo - the one on the far left of a block of 10 close to the call room.
my horror though, as I tugged on the door I found it locked. There were another nine empty alongside it, but I couldn't break my routine.
I hammered on the door, frantic that I might miss the start of the final.
A massive foreign thrower opened the door, looked daggers at me, but thankfully let me in. I couldn't break that routine for anyone!
If that felt like pressure, I had already experienced plenty in the 800m final a few days before.
Coming around the final bend in that race, I was side by side with Maria Mutola. She was the reigning world and Olympic champion, but more importantly she had also been my training partner. 
I knew how formidable she was, not just from losing to her previously in major championships, but also from working alongside her up close.
So much of my training had been about trying to shrug off that pressure.
I would be doing the final 100m of a heavy session, full of lactic acid and in pain and my coaches would be shouting one word at me, one instruction that was entirely contrary to everything I was feeling: ""Relax!""
In the previous tight finishes, my shoulders had risen, my body had tensed up and my stride length had shortened.
Not this time. I was so strong, I had so much faith in my preparation that I overhauled Mutola in the final 15m or so. I was so focused on beating her though, that I was unaware what was going on behind me.
As we had duelled at the front, Moroccan Hasna Benhassi and Jolanda Ceplak were storming up behind.
ree of us crossed the line together. My instinct was that I had got across first. But I wasn't sure. For a few seconds, everything seemed to go into slow motion as I looked around for confirmation.
It didn't come from the big screen or the trackside clock. Instead it was when one of the British press photographers. I glanced across and he was jumping up and down in celebration, telling me I had won. 
We spoke later and he said seeing me win close up was the best night of his life, but also the worst as he got so caught up in the moment that he missed getting any pictures of the winning moment.
He certainly had an accurate eye and sense of timing though. I had won, if only by five hundredths of a second.
By 02:00 on the morning after winning Olympic gold, some champions might have been sipping champagne. About that time I was shivering in an ice bath, admittedly with the medal around my neck.
I slept with it on my pillow as well, but come the morning it was time for stage two of the plan. I put it in a box, out of sight and out of mind, and pretended I hadn't won it.
I wasn't the only one keeping up this pretence. On one of the few days off between the 800m and 1500m final, I went to catch up with some friends and family in one of the private lounges that Team GB had set up.
Before I arrived, unbeknown to me, they had swept the lounge to get rid of all the British newspapers that used to be left about for people to read. They didn't want me seeing myself staring out of all the front pages and being spooked by the all the attention that was brewing back in the UK.
Whether it was their efforts or not, the 1500m final was an almost surreally calm experience.
I was really conscious of was Benhassi, whose fast finish for silver in the 800m final had marked her out as a threat.
rest of the field didn't really exist for me. It was like racing silhouettes, while I felt like I was floating along as if someone had picked up and propelled me through the race.
As I hit 80m to go, I looked over both shoulders, realised Benhassi was nowhere to be seen and went as hard as I could, without looking back.
gold were so much sweeter for all the suffering that had gone before them.
A stress fracture of the shin in 1996. A complete rupture of the Achilles tendon and calf in 1997. A damaged femoral nerve that caused me to lose sensation down one side of my body for five months of 1999. Another calf tear in 2000. Knee problems in 2003. The list of physical problems in my career was long.
But just as painful was the mental side. 
I suffered badly with depression and self-harm. Just a year before winning double gold in Athens, I was in Paris preparing for the world championships. While the media obsessed over whether I was working tactically alongside my training partner Mutola in the final, I was suffering a breakdown behind the scenes. Every night away from the cameras and microphones I would be in the depths of despair, hating my life and hurting myself.
But through all that I never stopped believing in myself. I didn't necessarily believe that I would win two golds, but I was certain of my ability.
Somebody being better than you isn't failure. You only fail if you don't do something, if you give up. People had told me that I should. I wasn't prepared to.

health	Dunstable attack probe care home residents at risk of harm - CQC	"People living at a care home where an 88-year-old woman died after an alleged attack by a fellow resident were at potential risk of harm, a report said.
Care Quality Commission (CQC) report criticised staffing levels, safety and care at Ridgeway Lodge in Dunstable, Bedfordshire.
Richard Uridge, the son of Sheila Hartman, who died from head injuries, said the report made ""grim reading"".
HC One, which runs the home, said it  had been addressing ""shortfalls"".
Mrs Hartman was taken to hospital with head injuries on 2 October and died that day. 
Bedfordshire Police said it was still investigating the death.
force confirmed a second woman from the home, who was in her 90s, was also taken to hospital and was still receiving specialist care.
Inspectors rated the home as ""requires improvement"" in all areas, following visits on 13, 18 and 27 October. 
me, which looks after up to 61 people with long-term conditions, mostly dementia, was caring for 52 adults at the time, the CQC said. 
was prompted ""in part by notification of an incident following which a person using the service died"".
CQC said that the circumstances surrounding the death were not being examined in its latest report, but the incident was being further investigated by the watchdog.
""However, the information shared with CQC about the incident indicated potential concerns about the management of risk of dementia care and staffing levels,"" the report said.
me would continue to be monitored and the CQC said it would ""take further action if needed"".
report found ""breaches in relation to safety management, staffing, person-centred care and the leadership of the home"". 
It said there were staff shortages and ""staff did not have effective training and competency checks in place"".
CQC said managers and the provider did not always investigate events and it found services were not always safe, effective, caring, responsive and well-led. 
Staff shortages ""placed people at potential risk of harm"", but staffing levels had been temporarily increased following the incident.
However, it said that over the past three months, there had been fewer night-time staff than ""the number the provider had defined as being safe, but no action had been taken about this"". 
It put people at ""risk of harm, especially those who needed more support at night"".
CQC report said: ""We believed people were at risk of experiencing harm and staff lacked knowledge and understanding about abuse and harm.""
People in the home told inspectors they felt safe, it found. 
Mr Uridge, from Shropshire, said: ""The CQC inspection report makes grim reading and I'm afraid confirms what we feared all along - that the home wasn't safe, effective or caring.
""Unless action is taken, not just in this home but elsewhere too, then older vulnerable people like my mother will continue to suffer and sadly to be injured and die.""
CQC said that following the incident the managers had worked ""with the police, local authority and safeguarding team"". 
A spokesman for Ridgeway Lodge said: ""We are pleased that the CQC have recognised the steps we have taken around increasing staffing levels and note the positive feedback from residents and relatives. 
""However, we recognise there are further improvements needed to meet the high standards our residents and their loved ones rightfully expect and deserve.""
He added that since October it had ""commenced actions and embedded new practices to specifically address these shortfalls"".  
Regarding the death of Mrs Hartman it said it was working closely with the relevant authorities to establish the full facts surrounding her death.

It said there had been a ""serious incident"" affecting its IT systems in the last 24 hours, with disruption to ""behind the scenes services"".
mpany said it was continuing to publish globally to its website - one of the most visited news sites in the world - and was ""confident"" it could still print the physical paper.
Staff have been told not to go into the office and to work from home.
In a statement, the Guardian said: ""Our technology teams have been working to deal with all aspects of this incident, with the vast majority of our staff able to work from home as we did during the pandemic.
""We believe this to be a ransomware attack, but are continuing to consider all possibilities.""
Ransomware is malicious software used by hackers - and often sent via attachments in emails - to gain access to an organisation's or individual's computer systems.
riminals then find and encrypt important or sensitive files - and demand a ransom for them to be unlocked.
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
A huge range of targets - from schools and hospitals to government agencies and media organisations - have fallen victim to ransomware, with research indicating hackers are paid in the majority of cases, especially in the UK.
According to the Press Gazette, the Guardian is the ninth most-read news site in the world, with almost 390 million visits in November.
In its own reporting of the incident, the Guardian said online publishing was ""largely unaffected"".
It said Guardian Media Group chief executive Anna Bateson and editor-in-chief Katharine Viner had sent a message to the company's workforce.
""Thank you to everyone working hard throughout this incident to keep us publishing,"" they said.
""We will continue to keep our staff and anyone else affected informed.

entertainment	Scene-stealer: Child star Lenny Rush's rise to fame	"Lenny Rush is getting rave reviews that other actors can only dream of - and yet he's just 13 years old. 
He's the ""fearless"" scene-stealer of Children in Need according to one critic, while another calls him ""phenomenal"" in Daisy May Cooper's dark comedy, Am I Being Unreasonable?
His latest show, CBBC's Dickensian drama Dodger, with Christopher Eccleston as Fagin, has just snapped up a Bafta in the week it returns to TV. 
So it's no surprise he handles talking about his five-year career with aplomb. 
Sitting on a sofa in his Essex home after a day at school, he's articulate and thoughtful - and funny. 
His mum Lisa is sitting nearby, but he's obviously used to handling interviews by himself. 
""Sometimes people think acting is glamorous. But even though it's hard work, I actually love it. It's so fun,"" he says. 
Lenny started acting with local drama classes at the Pauline Quirke Academy, and was quickly signed up by an agent.
But he was already used to being in front of a camera, having appeared in CBeebies documentary Our Family in 2017, which offers snapshots of family life.
One scene shows Lenny, his younger brother Bobby and their parents peeling vegetables for a roast dinner.
Lenny's early comic talent is immediately apparent - he grabs a stick of broccoli, transforming into a blushing bride, batting his eyelashes as he clutches his green bouquet.
Lenny went on to play Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol twice - on stage for the Old Vic, and then for BBC One - along with roles in BBC children's shows Apple Tree House and The Dumping Ground. 
On BBC One's Am I Being Unreasonable? he stars as Daisy May Cooper's often-exasperated son Ollie. It's a role that requires the young actor to deal with some pretty adult themes.
Lenny says he really picked up on moments when Ollie was ""vulnerable"", and says: ""What I really liked about that series is that at one point, we feel sorry for every single character.""
""What a gift they have in Rush, who has the comic chops and emotional range of an actor twice his age, and the kind of chemistry with Cooper that is an absolute joy to watch,"" wrote The Guardian's Lucy Mangan.
re's no doubt he is able to convey great depth with just a look or a comment, displaying skills and maturity way beyond many children his age. 
He has a disability - spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC) - a rare condition that results in short stature and skeletal anomalies, and a cleft palate. 
Might this have given him more life experience to draw on for his acting?
""I think - it's not nice to say this - but sometimes having a disability, people really take in the fact it's a DIS-ability. And I really don't think it is at all.""
Instead, he draws on the upsides, saying: ""Like when I did Tiny Tim, they were looking for disabled children. 
""So without having the disability, I wouldn't have been able to have done it. So I think there's more positives than negatives.""
Some of his more recent roles, including Ollie and Morgan, have not made his disability central to the part.
Lenny's agent put him up to play Ollie even though the character, as written on the page, did not have a disability. 
When he landed the part, the writers barely changed a word. He may travel around on a Segway, but his condition is just accepted as part of family life.
Lenny also got to experiment with improvising for the first time in his scenes with Cooper.
He admits he was ""very nervous"" about working without a script in front of the cast and crew, but his co-star was his safety net.
""I knew that if I got any bits where I didn't know what to say, she would always back me up.""
He is proud of one particularly funny scene - Ollie's birthday - which scored an impressive 820,000 likes on the BBC's TikTok account.
Ollie has to wear a truly terrible birthday cake hat from his nan, who has also given him Duplo, which is more suited to a toddler. He then has to speak to her on the phone and pretend he likes his gifts. 
get out of the call, he takes the phone and says the line is breaking up, rustling handfuls of wrapping paper and missing words out, before hanging up.
""That bit was my idea,"" he says with a grin. 
It's ""refreshing"" this role isn't about his disability, but he adds: ""Even if people do know I have a disability, that's fine. 
""My mum always says, 'Because you've got your disability and you're different, people remember you'.""
How does he feel about being a possible role model for other children?
""It's an honour,"" he says. ""For someone to see another person with the same thing as them on the telly - I think it gives them hope that it will be all right, you know.""
He himself has been inspired by Warwick Davis, whose acting credits include the Star Wars films, Harry Potter and Willow. 
SEDC, and met after Lenny worked with Davis's daughter, Annabelle, in The Dumping Ground.
""Warwick's lovely,"" Lenny says. ""He does a convention for people with dwarfism called Little People UK.
""We all go there and we have a disco in the night, it's great.""
He really enjoyed being part of the event, saying: ""To be honest, sometimes, especially when you're out where I live, in a small town, you don't really see a lot of little people, do you?
""You don't feel lonely, or the odd one out. You just kind of feel like the only one.
""It's crazy, you go to the convention, and there's all the other little people.""
Nowadays, he's a recognisable face on TV, and was recently asked to take charge of Pudsey's Celebrity Call Centre, herding unruly celebrities including Mo Farah, Richard Madeley, Mr Blobby and even Lord Sugar as they took donations from the public.
""It's everyone's dream, to be honest, bossing around celebrities,"" Lenny laughs.
ketch saw Lorraine Kelly playing against type by swearing like a trooper between calls.
""She let a few F-bombs slip out,"" Lenny laughs, but admits he wasn't in the room when she actually let rip. 
""That bit was cut in.""
Recalling Peter Andre's cameo, he says: ""I remember sitting there, and Peter Andre walking in, and thinking, 'I've got to tell Mum about this, she'll go crazy!'""
Lenny also gets some great lines in Dodger, which has just won best scripted programme at the Bafta Children and Young People's Awards. 
re, he plays Morgan the crossing sweeper, who has just been promoted to a shoe-shine.
w's upcoming Christmas special, which sees Dodger crash a festive party at 10 Downing Street, also gives a bit of backstory to Fagin.
""You get a little glimpse of him, he's lost some people in his life,"" says Rush, but adds it's a feel-good episode, with ""everyone coming together, having fun - that's what Christmas is really about"".
Next, he has voiced an unnamed Disney+ show, and will be in horror film The Queen Mary, starring Alice Eve, although he admits he's ""a bit of a scaredy cat"" and prefers thrillers.
Having caught the improvising bug, the young actor also wants to work on mockumentaries like Ricky Gervais's The Office and Cooper's This Country.
As for working with her again, he says with a smile: ""Oh I'd really like to. Maybe Daisy could write something, let's hope so.""
Christmas-based episode of Dodger is broadcast on 4 December on CBBC at 17:35 GMT."	/news/entertainment-arts-63741945
sports	Bruce Anstey: 'The doctors don't know how I'm still here' - Kiwi road racer talks about cancer battle	"When Bruce Anstey announced in April 2018 that he would be sitting out the forthcoming road racing season because of illness it came as a major shock to the sport's closely knit fraternity.
It was widely known that the popular New Zealander had previously been diagnosed with and received treatment for cancer but news that the illness had returned was met with a wave of sympathy and concern.
Anstey's partner Anny revealed on a Facebook post at the time that he had ""multiple tumours in his lungs and a tumour on his spine and a blood clot on the lung"".
52-year-old's impressive racing CV to date includes 12 Isle of Man TT wins, plus 13 and 10 victories respectively at the Ulster Grand Prix and North West 200 international events.
But in addition to his rare talent and exploits on the track, it is the quietly-spoken Kiwi's affable personality and laid-back attitude that have endeared him to legions of road racing fans across the world.
""I had cancer 25 years ago and it decided to come back in 2018,"" explained Anstey.
""I've been struggling with that, going through all the chemotherapy again, it's been a bit of a slog.
""By the second half of 2019 I was just starting to come right and won the 250cc race at the Classic TT on the Isle of Man, then Covid hit and I just had to keep out of the way for the last couple of years as my immune system is all shot.
""It's all good now. I had another small operation in 2019 to get rid of the last of it and I've been clear since then although I am still having blood tests every three months.
""The first time I had the treatment I really struggled but 25 years on the drugs stop you feeling as sick so that was much better.
""It was still hard but it seemed a lot easier this time as I knew what I was in for.
""The doctors still don't know if the cancer was the original one or the new one. They don't know how I'm still here really, so I'm a bit of a mystery to them.""
Anstey's ability to contend for major wins despite competing at just a selected few meetings each season has confounded observers of the sport for years and his consistency is evidenced by the fact that he achieved at least one podium finish at all three major internationals for 14 consecutive years between 2002 and 2015.
Wellington rider was a Superbike TT winner in 2015, the same year that his achievements were recognised by his native country when he became a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the New Year Honours.
He is also a former lap record holder for both the Isle of Man TT Mountain Course and the Ulster Grand Prix course at Dundrod.
""I don't know if I'll do the main TT again as I don't think I'm strong enough to do six laps,"" said Anstey of his plans for the future.
""But I really want to get out in the Classic TT again - maybe do the 500 and 250 races - that's my goal and hopefully that will happen in 2022.
""I definitely want to do the Classic TT and maybe some other bits and pieces in between.
""I'm just glad to be here and plan to get out there, enjoy life and have as much fun as possible.""
Previously resident in Windsor, outside London, Anstey is now living in the village of Cullybackey in county Antrim after recently moving to Northern Ireland with Anny.
""We needed a change. It's a lot quieter than where I was outside London and we are looking forward to it.
""I was at the Cookstown 100 on Saturday and it was great to be back out and about as I haven't been out for a long time.
""I hadn't been at a bikes meeting since 2019 so it was good to meet some old friends. Everybody is so friendly and it was nice to have a chat with everyone. It had been such a long time with Covid and everything."""	/sport/northern-ireland/58544514
health	Mum from Birmingham urges others to donate breast milk	"A mother who has donated bottles of her breast milk to help babies in neonatal units has urged others to do the same. 
Nicola McCavana, 34, donated 25 bottles over the last Christmas period to a milk bank at Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital. 
She gave birth to son Fionn in June 2021 and decided to donate after some breastfeeding challenges of her own. 
""All of it was worth it. If I've helped at least one baby, then that makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside,"" she said. 
""There are babies out there that need milk to get better and hopefully, home in time for Christmas.""
Ms McCavana, from the city's Northfield area, previously faced problems including blocked ducts and posterior tongue tie, which can make it harder for babies to breastfeed. 
However, last year she was among 138 breast milk donors who gave a total 7,870 litres of milk to the bank, the hospital said. 
About 6,570 litres went to neonatal units across the UK, including locally New Cross, Russells Hall and Walsall Manor hospitals. 
""Helping with milk donations - it's really hard to put into words how it makes you feel,"" Ms McCavana said. 
""Helpful, content, it's nice to help where I can, it's a little hit of oxytocin, to really put some love out into the world. 
""I'd 100% recommend to other women if they are able or feel comfortable enough to donate.""
Milk bank workers said they wanted to support mothers and keep completing the milk rounds over Christmas.
More than 50 motorcyclists with Midlands Freewheelers Group help deliver to the units, including the aptly named Max Christmas, who made collections over the last festive period.
Mr Christmas, 56, said he wanted to help because his daughter, now 29, was born prematurely weighing just 4lb 2 oz (1.87kg). 
""We had to feed her through a syringe through her nose and the milk donated really does make a difference to families,"" he said.

health	South West Acute Hospital: SWAH announcement 'devastating'	"mporary withdrawal of emergency general surgery from South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) is ""shocking"" and ""devastating"", locals have said.
Western Health and Social Care Trust has not said when it expects emergency general surgery to resume.
Its chief executive officer, Neil Guckian, said that ""patients will be safer with these changes"".
But some people in County Fermanagh did not seem convinced about Thursday's announcement. 
""The trust don't understand what it's like to have a rural hospital - travel is not acceptable,"" Dermot Browne told BBC News NI.
""We fought hard to get this hospital here in the first place.""
Mr Browne added that ""the direction of travel has been concerning for people here"".
""If there is an issue with staff that needs to be resolved with services reinstated as soon as possible.""
Despite saying the move was temporary, the trust did not say when it expected emergency general surgery would resume.
mergency department and other services including obstetrics will continue to operate as normal.
Other - mostly lower grade - surgeons will remain on site at the County Fermanagh hospital.
rust said this was necessary to protect the public's safety after it had problems recruiting surgical staff.
Protesters gathered outside the town hall in objection to the announcement.
Representatives from the trust held a meeting with local community and council representatives in Enniskillen Town Hall on Thursday evening.
At it, Mr Guckian said that regardless of what had been reported in the media, he was ""proud of the engagement between the trust and the council"".
He said the trust was dealing with a very difficult situation in regard to emergency surgery and was ""working our way through this"".
He paid tribute to all surgeons at SWAH for maintaining services over the years in challenging circumstances. 
However, Reggie Ferguson, chairman from Save Our Acute Services (SOAS), told the meeting it was his organisation's belief that the trust had been deliberately running down services in preparation for the announcement.
""This has been on the cards for a long time,"" he said.
""Your communication is terrible, everything seems to be behind the scenes.""
Referring to the region's poor infrastructure in the context of proposals to transport some patients to other hospitals, Mr Ferguson added: ""The road to Altnagelvin would make you sick if you weren't sick already."" 
UUP councillor Diane Armstrong said it was ""a dark day that affects everybody, man, woman and child"".
Ms Armstrong said the people of Fermanagh and south Tyrone ""feel marginalised by this decision"", and she was personally ""absolutely disgusted"".
No one likes change -  especially if it affects your local health service.  
But according to Raphael Bengoa - and several other health experts who've penned health reviews - change is necessary if Northern Ireland's health system is to be sustainable. 
People in Enniskillen say they are the latest ""casualties"" in plans to change how services are delivered across the region. 
Western Trust argues that change is necessary as the service is no longer safe. 
Whatever the argument, local people say it feels like this is being thrust on them as a last resort.  
me what should have taken place was much needed dialogue, explanation and local people being properly informed about how the proposed changes will affect them.
Instead, they say, a vacuum was created which encouraged rumour and misinformation that SWAH was set to remove all its emergency services. 
While making any sort of change to the Northern Ireland health and social care system can be politicised and emotive - not having those conversations in advance can often be even more problematic. 
Diane McCaffery, who attended with her husband Eunan, is a retired emergency care manager from the cardio assessment unit at SWAH.
She said she had seen first hand how emergency surgery saved lives and thought this decision to reduce surgical services was ""catastrophic"".
Carmel Tracey and her daughter Emily said they ""know the implications"" of the announcement.
""Having to be transferred could put your life at risk. We deserve better,"" said added Ms Tracey.
Sinn FÃ©in MP Michelle Gildernew challenged the trustÂ to set out clearly their plan for the restoration of emergency surgical services.
""The people of Fermanagh (and South Tyrone) need clarity from the trust on the steps they have taken to date, but most importantly, the actions they will now take, to ensure emergency surgical services at SWAH are urgently restored.Â 
""Vague assurances will not do.""
Earlier in the day, DUP MLA Deborah Erskine said she understood the concerns of constituents but felt there was good news for the hospital's future with the announcement that it is to become a new centre for planned surgery.
""The pressures with surgeons date back to 2018 in the Western Trust,"" she said.
""We need to have a system, we need to have a way forward in which we ensure services are safe for both the workplace in the SWAH and also for our patients."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63644073
entertainment	Somerset woman dedicates her first book to children she fostered	"A foster carer has dedicated her first book to all the children who came to her ""without warm jumpers"".Â 
Emma Lloyd, 52, who has fostered for more than eight years, said reading to the children would help them settle at night and ""forget unhappy memories"".
uthor, from Wellington, wrote the book after her own son thought the stories she made up should be shared. 
Little Red Dragon is about a dragon who encounters friendship and kindness as he looks for his missing jumper.Â Â 
Ms Lloyd said she was inspired to start fostering by friends and has since taken in babies, siblings and teenagers. 
""They can arrive late at night, maybe without pyjamas or shoes for the next day, and often without warm coats or jumpers,"" Ms Lloyd said.
""It's a scary time for these children and sometimes they display that through their behaviour.Â But it is an incredibly rewarding role.
""Seeing them a few months later, twirling around in their new party dress or proudly heading off to school - these are all little pictures I keep in my mind of children building their self-esteem and confidence,"" she said.Â 
Ms Lloyd was telling The Little Red Dragon to her eight-year-old daughter when her son, 17, walked in and told her she should ""write it down so other children could hear it"".
""For traumatised children especially, reading can allow them to lose themselves in another world and forget unhappy memories, or feelings of sadness or anger, just for a moment,"" she explained.
Ms Lloyd said rather than reading a book, she would dim the lights and tell her own story, which would comfort children, while not being stimulated by pictures, and help them get to sleep.Â 
On having the book published, Ms Lloyd said one of the ""nicest moments"" was when she received a video of a child she had fostered, with her new adoptive parents reading the book.
""That was lovely to see, because it was children like her that inspired me to publish it,"" she said.
Somerset County Council lead member for children and families, Tessa Munt, said the county urgently needed more foster homes and it was ""wonderful"" to see Ms Lloyd raising awareness of the importance of fostering.

politics	The Troubles: Alex Maskey's historical convictions quashed	"Stormont speaker Alex Maskey and his wife Elizabeth's convictions for trying to escape from prison are to be quashed.
Senior judges from the Court of Appeal ruled the couple had been unlawfully detained during the 1970s.
was because their periods of internment were not personally authorised by the NI secretary.
Mr Maskey served as Sinn FÃ©in's first Lord Mayor of Belfast from 2002 to 2003.
He has been a member at Stormont since 1998, representing the West and South Belfast constituencies, before announcing his intention to stand down in 2021.
Mr Maskey was appointed Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2020, a role which he still technically holds as political stalemate continues.
He described today's outcome as ""righting a wrong"" in British Government policy at the time.
""They had scant regard for their own laws; internment was an unmitigated disaster,"" he said.
On 9 August 1971, Prime Minister Brian Faulkner used the Special Powers Act to introduce internment without trial for those suspected of being involved in violence during the early stages of the Troubles.
More than 1,900 people suspected of being members of paramilitary organisations were detained, but many were arrested based on flawed intelligence.
Mr Maskey, 70, had been interned at Long Kesh internment camp - later known as the Maze Prison - in December 1972.
He was convicted of attempting to escape from lawful custody in March 1973 and sentenced to six-months imprisonment.
In the same month his future wife, then Elizabeth McKee, mounted a bid to break out of Armagh Jail, where she had been similarly held without trial.
She was also found guilty of attempting to escape, receiving a nine-month sentence.
In 2020, the Supreme Court quashed Gerry Adams' convictions for twice trying to escape from Long Kesh in 1973 and 1974.
judge said Mr Adams' detention was unlawful because it had not been ""considered personally"" by secretary at the time, William Whitelaw.
former Sinn FÃ©in leader welcomed the Supreme Court's decision, saying internment without trial ""set aside the normal principles of law and was based on a blunt and brutal piece of coercive legislation"".
""There is an onus on the British government to identify and inform other internees whose internment may also have been unlawful,"" he said.
Mr Adams is currently challenging a Department of Justice decision to refuse a compensation pay-out.
Based on Gerry Adams' judgment, Mr and Mrs Maskey's legal representatives, Madden & Finucane Solicitors, challenged their convictions.
In court, the Public Prosecution Service accepted that the The Interim Custody Order (ICO)  in both Maskey cases were also invalid.
With the appeals unopposed, Lady Chief Justice Dame Siobhan Keegan described the previous determination of the Supreme Court as ""binding"".
Granting both appeals she confirmed: ""The convictions and sentences are quashed.""
Outside court, Mr Maskey insisted nobody should have been subjected to internment.
He added that today's outcome ""just highlights the series of fundamental problems"" around the way Northern Ireland was administered at that time."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63906098
health	World's longest Covid sufferer stages come-back gig in Bristol	"""miracle man"" who was infected with Covid for more than 10 months has staged a come-back concert with some help from the English National Opera. 
Dave Smith, from Bristol, had Covid for nearly 300 days - longer than anyone else recorded in the world. 
73-year-old was hospitalised seven times and said he had ""resigned"" himself to dying. 
But now the life-long musician is back on stage after some breath coaching from a professional opera singer. 
Mr Smith described his experience of getting Covid in May 2020 as ""like someone has pulled the plug and life is just draining out of your body"".
He lost 10 stone (63.5kg) during his illness and was left barely able to walk or hold a conversation.
Mr Smith, a driving instructor by day and a lead singer by night, was finally cured after being offered a cocktail of antiviral drugs developed by a company in the US last summer.  
Mr Smith's road to full recovery has been slow, and in the past year he has been admitted to hospital several times for breathing problems. 
He can only do a few minutes of activity before sitting down, and until recently he was unable to do the thing he missed most in the world - singing. 
Describing what performing again would mean to him before the course, Mr Smith told BBC Breakfast: ""It would be like having my complete life back, I know I have got my physical life back but it would be my mental life as well.""
He joked that when he sang he felt like a ""squeezebox with all the air squeezed out"". 
Mr Smith was thrown a lifeline after being accepted onto a six-week breath work course developed by Suzie Zumpe of the English National Opera (EN) in partnership with Imperial College London. 
Over 90% of people who take part say they have noticed an improvement in their symptoms and they would recommend it to other sufferers.
Jenny Mollica, director of ENO Breathe, said: ""We know that opera singers are used to filling big auditoriums with their voice completely unamplified, so they understand breath control, they understand the physiology of breathing.
""What we are doing is working with some of that expertise to give them skills and strategies to manage their breathlessness post-Covid.""
By Jon Kay
When I first met the retired driving-instructor in Bristol in June 2021, he had finally recovered from Covid after having the active virus in his body for more than 300 days - longer than anyone else on the planet. 
He was still very frail and his lungs were badly damaged. 
He could only walk a few steps before he needed to rest and he told me the thing he missed the most was singing. 
For years, Dave had performed in pubs and clubs around Bristol, but it seemed his gigging days were over. 
However, this autumn we filmed his progress for BBC Breakfast as he took part in online singing lessons through the ENO Breathe course for the NHS. 
Dave was a little perplexed at first - some of the vocal exercises were ""a bit weird"" he said - but, over six weeks, the techniques he learned seemed to lead to a marked improvement in his lung capacity and his confidence. 
It wasn't long before he decided he could fulfil his dream of getting back up on stage and performing with his band. 
gig itself was one of the best I've ever been to. 
Not because of the music itself - Dave still struggles a bit with his voice - but the goodwill and love for Dave in the room was extraordinary. 
Mr Smith said when doctors told him he only had 51% of his lung capacity, he thought his singing days were over. 
But within weeks of finishing his breath course, he was planning his comeback. 
He said then: ""I'm pretty sure I can do it, singing makes you feel really happy and when it goes well it's such a buzz. The endorphins get going. It's absolutely brilliant.""
Mr Smith and his band booked the Langley Arms pub near Bristol and on the night of the performance it was packed with friends and family. 
raised some money for Southmead Hospital, where Mr Smith was treated, with a Christmas raffle.  
His idol, Francis Rossi of Status Quo, even had a few words of advice. 
rock star told Mr Smith ""to think of it as 'just another gig, that way you can do you and enjoy it. It will be fun.
Mr Smith said the call ""boosted me right up"".
Mr Smith's wife Lynda said: ""You never would have thought it would have been possible - two years ago he was at death's door five times. 
""He was determined to do it.""
Step-son Rich Nicholls said: ""He wasn't able to walk. We had to get the stair lift in just for him to be able to get upstairs. 
""He could barely hold a conversation without being out of breath. It's amazing.""
Suzie Zumpe of the ENO even showed up to do a duet.
Speaking after the gig, Mr Smith said: ""It was great. It was a real rush and the crowd was behind me. I'm not 100% and it's taken it out of me.
""It'll probably be my last performance ever.""

sports	W Series: Is Britain's Jamie Chadwick set to win a third title?	"A new season of the W Series begins this weekend in the heat of Miami. 
Now in its third year, the championship will open with a double-header in support of Formula 1's inaugural Miami Grand Prix, with Britain's Jamie Chadwick aiming to win a hat-trick of championship titles. 
In total, eight rounds of competition will share a global stage with F1 across various weekends in 2022. 
r will take in iconic circuits such as Silverstone in Great Britain and Suzuka in Japan, before the season finale at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City in October. 
Lights out for race one at the Miami International Autodrome, which is situated within the Hard Rock Stadium - home to the Miami Dolphins - will be at 19:30 BST on Saturday.
Drivers will then return to the track on Sunday for the second race at 15:35 BST. 
Chadwick has dominated the women-only motor racing series since it began in 2019. 
Williams development driver claimed the first championship with a fourth-placed finish at Brands Hatch three years ago, beating the Netherlands' Beitske Visser by 10 points to win the $500,000 (Â£415,000) prize.
She successfully defended her crown in 2021, sealing victory over fierce title rival and fellow Briton Alice Powell in the season finale at Austin, Texas, seven months ago. 
Chadwick, who is a six-time race winner, embarks on a new challenge this season, making the switch from Veloce Racing to Caitlyn Jenner's new Jenner Racing team. 
23-year-old said the W Series was ""a key step on my journey towards competing in F1"" and the championship offers ""more competitive experience at world-class circuits"".
Five drivers will be making their debut in the sport - all of whom are between 16 and 19 years old - to make up an 18-driver grid. 
Established racers Powell and Finland's Emma Kimilainen, who were second and third respectively in last year's standings, are also returning.

Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies (AIMP) said the situation was ""unacceptable"" and it was time for the government to get a plan in place.
Four antibiotics, which treat different conditions, have been added to a list of products that the UK cannot export.
UK government says it is working urgently with manufacturers and wholesalers to speed up deliveries.
However, Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the AIMP, which represents 4,000 pharmacies in the UK, said the supply of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections including strep A and scarlet fever was ""very poor"".
She said the problem had been highlighted a week ago, but it was now getting worse, making it very difficult to get hold of any antibiotics.
""People are having to go from one pharmacy to another - it's chaos,"" she said.
""Supplies are not coming through to us and it feels like no-one cares.""
Dr Hannbeck said putting four antibiotics - three of which are go-to treatments for strep A - on the banned UK export list because of high demand was ""too little too late"". 
Amoxicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), azithromycin oral suspension and cefalexin are used to treat a large range of bacterial infections, including throat, chest and skin infections.
Her message to worried parents is that pharmacists are working very hard to find alternatives, and also changing formulations from solid pills to liquid medicines.
But even the alternatives are running short, Dr Hannbeck says.
A spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care said manufacturers currently have supplies of antibiotics to treat strep A and they are trying to get that stock to pharmacies.
""We continue to work urgently with manufacturers and wholesalers to expedite deliveries, bring forward stock they have to help ensure it gets to where it's needed and boost supply to meet demand as quickly as possible, and support access to these vital medicines,"" they said.
GPs have been advised to prescribe antibiotics for children who may have worsening symptoms linked to strep A, a bacterial infection which can lead to scarlet fever and, very rarely, a serious and fatal invasive infection called iGAS.
Strep A: What you need to know, in a minute
Strep A infections tend to increase in the winter and peak in the spring, but this year cases are rising at an earlier point than usual - probably because of changes in the normal cycle of infections due to the pandemic.
Since September, 15 children in the UK have died after severe iGAS infections, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Figures for England show that 45 adults have also died from the same condition in the same period.
ghest number of deaths since the winter of 2017-18, when 27 children and 328 adults died with invasive strep A.
rade body which represents drug wholesalers, the Healthcare Distribution Association (HDA), said more stock of antibiotics was being delivered into warehouses now and would be with pharmacies in the coming days.
Martin Sawer, executive director of the HDA, said one national wholesaler had told him that demand for medicines had risen by 400-500% on last December.
""We are prioritising all the antibiotics amid huge demand for them, particularly liquid solutions,"" he said.
Pharmacists also say they are being charged up to Â£19 for a pack of drugs that normally costs a few pounds, after prices went up sharply amid a rise in cases of strep A.
As a result, they say they are losing thousands of pounds a week because only a fraction of what the drugs cost can be recouped from the NHS.
Competition and Markets Authority is now investigating the pricing of antibiotics by drug companies. It says it wants companies to be clear about their legal obligations.
""There should be no doubt that it is illegal for a dominant company to charge excessive prices, or for any companies to collude to drive up prices,"" the CMA said.

politics	Boundary review: Tories could make modest gains from new election map	"Conservatives could gain slightly from a proposed shake-up of England's electoral map, an initial analysis suggests.
Leading experts said the party would have won an additional five seats at the last election under new draft parliamentary constituencies.
It is part of a regular redrawing of the political map to ensure seats have roughly the same number of voters.
roposals were released on Tuesday, to be finalised by July 2023.
rhaul is the first redrawing of constituency boundaries since 2010, and is set to be used at the next general election, expected in 2024.
w boundaries, based on voter registration figures, will see England receive an additional 10 MPs, taking its total seats to 543.
Wales is due to lose eight of its current 40 seats, with the total for Scotland falling from 59 to 57. The number in Northern Ireland remains the same. 
revised seat borders come from the Boundary Commission for England, one of four independent bodies in each of the UK nations responsible for redesigning parliamentary constituencies.
Boundary commission officials are redrawing constituency boundaries to ensure between 69,724 and 77,062 people live in each one.
mate about the effect of the proposals in England comes from academics commissioned by media outlets - including the BBC - to inform coverage ahead of the next election.
rojections are designed to ensure broadcasters take a similar approach to calculating gains and losses, as well as marginal seats likely to form the key electoral battlegrounds.
A definitive analysis of the new boundaries, conducted by professors Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, will be released after the proposals are confirmed next year.
But in an initial assessment, they estimated the Conservatives would have won 353 of the 543 recommended seats in England if they had been in place at the last general election in 2019. 
redict the Tories would have won all seven of the new seats proposed for the South East, whilst Labour would have potentially won three extra seats in London based on new boundaries in the capital.
king into account earlier revised recommendations for Wales and the likely outcome in Scotland, they said the Tories would have won 370 seats instead of 365 in 2019.
Under their analysis, the number of seats won by Labour would have been the same at 202. The number won by the SNP would also have remained at 48, but the Lib Dems would have won eight instead of 11. Plaid Cymru would have also seen a drop from four seats to two.
""It does not look as if the new constituency map will have a substantive impact on the arithmetic of the next general election,"" the two electoral experts said. 
""The boost for the Conservatives is very small in the context of their current position in the opinion polls.
""Labour will remain very far behind still needing a swing of [around] 12% to achieve an overall majority.""
undary changes are likely to have a big impact on those MPs whose constituencies are set to be substantially redrawn, or abandoned altogether, under the new proposals.
ude Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, whose Wyre and Preston North seat is due to be abolished and split into three surrounding Lancashire constituencies.
Also in the same position is shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, whose Leeds West seat is also due to be split three ways, and Home Secretary Suella Braverman, whose Fareham seat is being split in two. 
Also facing uncertainty is Sir Gavin Williamson, whose South Staffordshire seat is set to merge with part of Dudley South, held by party colleague Mike Wood.
Deputy PM Dominic Raab, who narrowly retained his Esher & Walton seat in 2019, could face an even tougher task next time - with his constituency expected to become more marginal under new boundaries.
Liberal Democrat Leader Sir Ed Davey is also expected to face a sterner test after his Kingston and Surbiton seat was changed - although he has confirmed he expects to stand in the new constituency.
As well as having an impact on national politics, the setting of new constituency boundaries has long been a source of contention locally.
rticularly the case with constituencies cutting across counties, such as the proposed new Waveney Valley seat, which would straddle Norfolk and Suffolk.  
Changing the name of a constituency can also be controversial - as can be seen in the latest proposals, where a plan to rename the Derbyshire seat of Erewash to ""Ilkeston and Long Eaton"" has been dropped following a local backlash.
m Bowden, secretary to the Boundary Commission for England, said members of the public commenting on the proposals often mentioned a link to geographical features such as rivers and mountain ranges.
Speaking to the BBC, he added that others gave feedback relating to the location of schools, GP surgeries, or local bus routes. ""We do our best to take account of all those different factors,"" he added. 
He also said the commission was keen to take account ""as much as we possibly can"" of people's feelings about on constituency names, adding they were a matter that attracted ""passionate views"". 
A consultation on the latest plans closes on 5 December."	/news/uk-politics-63556905
politics	Mary Lou McDonald's remarks criticised by widow of garda shot by IRA	"widow of a detective shot dead by the IRA in 1996 has criticised comments by Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald that there was ""no comparison"" between the IRA and gangland violence.
Garda (Irish police officer) Jerry McCabe was killed and his colleague was injured during an armed raid on a post office van in Adare, County Limerick.
Four Provisional IRA members were convicted of the manslaughter of Mr McCabe.
released from prison.
Ms McDonald was speaking to the radio station Newstalk in an interview which coincided with Sinn FÃ©in's ard fheis (annual conference).
She was asked about gangland violence and said there was ""no comparison"" between IRA violence during the Troubles and such criminality. 
""If we are going to talk about things that happened in the course of the conflict, that's one thing, that's one discussion,"" she said.
""As somebody who represents the north inner city of Dublin and who has seen at first hand the corrosive damage that gangland, so-called, has caused to communities, there is absolutely no comparison. 
""Things that happened in the course of a very long political conflict, which thank god is now long over - we have had 25 years of peace - that there is no comparison between that and the kind of challenge -and it is an ongoing challenge to our society - that this vicious so-called gangland crime epidemic poses.""
Mr McCabe's widow Ann criticised Ms McDonald's remarks.
four men convicted for her husband's manslaughter were all released by 2009.
""No matter who commits murder, murder is murder"", she said - adding she believed there was no difference between the IRA men who killed her husband and any other criminals.
""The IRA were up to their eyes in murder and carnage,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show .
""My view will never change.
""They are trying to get the new generation round to their way of thinking.
""My husband wasn't part of the Troubles at all. He was escorting money, as was his partner Ben O'Sullivan, who has sadly since passed away.""
She said the Provisional IRA changed her life and her family's life forever.
""Life will never be the same again,"" she said.
""I have wonderful friends and family and grandkids - they keep me going but Jerry will never leave my mind. 
""Not a day goes by that I don't think of him.""
One of Mr McCabe's killers, Pearse McAuley, was later jailed for stabbing his estranged wife 13 times with a steak knife.
f an Irish prison officer who was murdered by the IRA also criticised Mrs McDonald's remarks.
Austin Stack, whose father Brian was the only prison officer murdered in the Republic of Ireland during the Troubles, said there were similarities.
""What planet is she on? Murder, punishment beatings, drug dealing, protection rackets are what gangsters and IRA both do well,"" he tweeted.
In January 2013, then Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams apologised for Mr McCabe's killing.
Mr Adams apologised in the DÃ¡il (lower house of Irish parliament), as he paid tribute to an officer shot dead during a robbery in his constituency.
He said the death of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe had provoked memories of the killing of Mr McCabe and the wounding of Mr O'Sullivan.
""I want to apologise to Mrs McCabe and the McCabe family, and to Garda Ben O'Sullivan and to the families of other members of the state forces who were killed by republicans in the course of the conflict,"" said Mr Adams.
""I am very sorry for the pain and loss inflicted on those families. No words of mine can remove that hurt. Dreadful events cannot be undone.""

entertainment	Stephen Bear: TV star will do anything to boost fame hears court	"A former reality TV contestant is a ""self-obsessed show-off"" who will do anything to boost his own fame, a court heard.
Stephen Bear is accused of secretly filming himself having sex with Georgia Harrison and sharing the video online.
A jury heard he would broadcast details of women's ""private sexual lives"" if it got him ""notoriety"".
He denies voyeurism and two counts of disclosing private, sexual photographs and films.
During his trial, Chelmsford Crown Court was told Mr Bear, 32, of Bryony Close, Loughton, Essex, filmed himself and 27-year-old Ms Harrison having sex in his garden in August 2020 before sharing it on WhatsApp and posting it on subscription site OnlyFans.
Ms Harrison, who has waived her right to anonymity in the case, accused him of sending the footage to someone that evening, but the defendant said this was a ""complete lie"".
He has denied uploading the footage and said he had deleted the video.  
Jurors heard how he had earned Â£40,000 from OnlyFans and more than Â£2,000 from the video in question.
Ms Harrison, who has appeared on Love Island and The Only Way is Essex, said she never gave consent for the video to be shared and is seeking civil compensation alongside a criminal trial.
She told the court she discovered the video was online in early December 2020 and had to hire someone to get it removed from porn sites.
Mr Bear, who appeared on MTV's Ex On The Beach and won Celebrity Big Brother in 2016, was arrested after returning from Dubai in January 2021. 
In her closing speech, prosecutor Jacqueline Carey KC said Mr Bear had bragged from the witness stand about sleeping with models.
""He broadcast their private sexual lives in open court and gave no thought to their privacy at all,"" she said.
""If it gets him fame, money, notoriety or trending on Twitter he will say whatever he wants, he will do whatever he wants and distribute whatever he wants.
""The prosecution are not asking you to convict Stephen Bear because he sleeps with women and doesn't call them back. As ungentlemanly as it is, that is not what he is charged with.
""He is not charged with being a self-obsessed show-off. The prosecution are asking you to convict him because the evidence proves he is guilty.""
Defence barrister, Gemma Rose, said: ""You may not agree with Mr Bear's views or his work online but this is not a court of morals.
""You must judge the case on the evidence that is put before you.
""You cannot be sure that Mr Bear uploaded that video or instructed anyone to upload it.""
rial continues.

politics	Disused cruise ships could be used to house asylum seekers - Braverman	"Home Secretary Suella Braverman has not ruled out using disused cruise ships to house asylum seekers, saying ""everything is on the table"".
She said it was ""unacceptable"" that housing asylum seekers in hotels costs the taxpayer more than Â£5m a day. 
She told a House of Lords committee a range of alternatives are ""on the table"" and are being looked at. 
Rishi Sunak raised the idea of using cruise ships during his summer Tory leadership campaign.  
Appearing before the Lords Justice and Home Affairs Committee, Ms Braverman suggested officials are in talks with ship companies. 
me secretary said she wanted to end the use of hotels ""as quickly as possible because it's an unacceptable cost to the taxpayer"".  
She said the total cost of housing and supporting asylum seekers this financial year would rise to Â£3.5bn, of which Â£2.3bn would be spent on hotels. 
Ms Braverman added: ""We will bring forward a range of alternative sites, they will include disused holiday parks, former student halls - I should say we are looking at those sites - I wouldn't say anything is confirmed yet.
""But we need to bring forward thousands of places, and when you talk about vessels all I can say is - because we are in discussion with a wide variety of providers - that everything is still on the table and nothing is excluded."" 
me secretary said 117,000 asylum seekers were currently being accommodated - 57,000 by local authorities. 
m was to increase the local authority figure to 100,000, but that was proving ""incredibly difficult"", she added. 
Mr Sunak put forward the cruise ship idea in July, as part of a 10-point plan to tackle illegal immigration. 
Liberal Democrat spokesman Alistair Carmichael MP said the cost to taxpayers of the government's ""failed asylum policy has become simply astronomical"". 
He also accused the home secretary of ""doubling down with the same failed approach"" by not creating safe and legal routes for refugees or dealing with the claims backlog.
Mr Carmichael described the cruise ship idea as ""ludicrous, ineffective and incredibly expensive"". 
Ms Braverman told the committee that staff assessing asylum claims were each making one decision a week on average.
She said more than 100,000 asylum seekers are still awaiting a decision, and in some cases have been waiting longer than a year.
mprove the productivity of case workers was highlighted by the home secretary. She told the committee there would be greater use of digital technology and a move away from a paper-based system. 
Ms Braverman was also asked if a new airline had been found to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. 
She replied that there were ""ongoing discussions with several airlines"". Spanish carrier Privilege Style pulled out of the scheme in October under pressure from campaigners.
""We are returning people almost every week to various countries around the world... so we are in a variety of discussions with several airlines for a lot of different destinations,"" the home secretary added. 
Earlier this week Ms Braverman said she was committed to sending migrants to Rwanda as soon as possible after High Court judges ruled the plan to send some migrants who cross the Channel in small boats to the African country was lawful. "	/news/uk-politics-64053099
health	Clampdown on social media adverts for risky hay-fever jab	"Companies will be prosecuted if they continue to advertise a prescription-only hay-fever drug on social media, the UK government says.
Kenalog is a steroid injection that the NHS stopped offering years ago because of the risk of serious side effects. 
Some private medical and aesthetic beauty clinics have been told to remove promotional posts for the jab from Facebook and Instagram. 
Even including a syringe emoji would be a breach of the law.
Kenalog is not licensed for the treatment of hay-fever in the UK, although it is licensed for some other conditions on prescription.
Some beauty and aesthetics clinics, however, are offering it to hay-fever sufferers.
Hay fever is a pollen allergy which is most commonly treated with antihistamine drops, tablets and nasal sprays.
It causes sneezing, coughing, a blocked nose and additional problems for those with asthma. 
For some, these treatments don't have any effect, which is prompting some people to try Kenalog instead. 
It has not been approved for hay-fever treatment by the NHS because its benefits do not outweigh the risks of using it.
Steroids are anti-inflammatory medications used for asthma and arthritis but come with side effects such as weight gain, sleeping difficulties and sometimes anxiety or depression. 
Committees of Advertising Practice (Cap) have worked with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to issue the enforcement on Kenalog advertising.
It must not be advertised anywhere, including on social-media posts or on websites, as a treatment for hay fever in the UK or referred to as a ""hay-fever injection"" or ""hay-fever jab"". 
Companies have until the end of August to make these changes before being referred to the MHRA for further enforcement action. 
Claire Tilstone, from the MHRA, says ""the advertising of prescription-only medicines in the UK is banned under UK advertising law"" and encourages anyone who sees a clinic advertising Kenalog to report it to the agency or to Cap.
Allergy UK has previously said the steroid injection is not recommended as it is a high-dose steroid given by an intramuscular injection, and once injected, the steroid cannot be removed - and it comes with ""a high side-effect profile""."	/news/health-62428032

politics	Boris Johnson pulls out of leadership race: Statement in full	"Boris Johnson has ruled himself out of the race to be the next Conservative Party leader and prime minister. Here is his statement in full:
In the last few days I have been overwhelmed by the number of people who suggested that I should once again contest the Conservative Party leadership, both among the public and among friends and colleagues in Parliament.
I have been attracted because I led our party into a massive election victory less than three years ago - and I believe I am therefore uniquely placed to avert a general election now.
A general election would be a further disastrous distraction just when the Government must focus on the economic pressures faced by families across the country.
I believe I am well placed to deliver a Conservative victory in 2024 - and tonight I can confirm that I have cleared the very high hurdle of 102 nominations, including a proposer and a seconder, and I could put my nomination in tomorrow.
re is a very good chance that I would be successful in the election with Conservative Party members - and that I could indeed be back in Downing Street on Friday.
But in the course of the last days I have sadly come to the conclusion that this would simply not be the right thing to do. You can't govern effectively unless you have a united party in parliament.
And though I have reached out to both Rishi (Sunak) and Penny (Mordaunt) - because I hoped that we could come together in the national interest - we have sadly not been able to work out a way of doing this.
refore I am afraid the best thing is that I do not allow my nomination to go forward and commit my support to whoever succeeds.
I believe I have much to offer but I am afraid that this is simply not the right time."	/news/uk-politics-63368973
business	Cost of living: 'No-one likes us. We DO care. We are Millwall'	"A chant delivered for decades on the terraces of Millwall football club goes: ""No-one likes, no-one likes us, no-one likes us. We don't care.""
But Christine Cunningham knows that is not true. The club and its fans do care - especially now when the soaring cost of living is making life so hard for those who live in the neighbourhood.
58-year-old benefits from the on-site food bank which is stocked in part by donations brought by supporters on match days.
""It is the difference between having something hot on a bit of bread, or nothing,"" says Mrs Cunningham, a grandmother of 11.
""I felt a bit too proud to come at first but, blimey, those food prices are high and there is only so much you can cut back on.""
Lions Food Hub is inside Millwall's stadium - The Den - in Bermondsey, south east London. It is run by Kelly Webster, a former player for Millwall's women's team - the Lionesses - who herself has struggled for money in the past.
""I've been homeless, in a hostel eating sweetcorn and hotdogs. Now, I felt I had to give something back,"" the 46-year-old says.
Having hung up her boots, she provides food for about 50 local families at the hub, serving people aged anywhere between their early 20s and mid-70s.
Milk, food, butter, sausages, mince and a range of canned food all come in, or are bought from cash donations, then go out to those in need.
It seems an unlikely location for a food bank, but reflects a wider campaign among English Football League (EFL) clubs to support their local communities.
fact that it is Millwall who is at the vanguard of this campaign is significant. For many years, the club has suffered from a poor reputation, in part caused by the behaviour of some of its fans, hence the ""no-one likes us"" chant.
Steve Kavanagh, the club's chief executive, says that the notoriety means they have to work harder to help out a primarily working-class fan base and local community.
""You soon realise this is a family club, and we can see what people are facing at the moment,"" he says. ""Like all families, it can be dysfunctional and difficult, but we look after each other. We feel we have to go even further because of our history."" 
mphasise his point, he is speaking in the club's boardroom which is full, not of wealthy football club bosses, but of locals enjoying a free coffee morning.
weekly session began when Covid lockdowns were lifted, giving older fans the chance to come somewhere safe and to encourage them to get back out into society. Now, it has a financial element too, and is a warm place for people to meet.
Among them is 88-year-old Kenneth Saville, who says he comes to the coffee morning for ""family, company and cake"". 
His son and carer, Peter, says: ""Everyone is welcome here. It doesn't matter if you are a [Millwall] supporter, or not.""
re are people across the country just like Kenneth, Peter and Christine - all affected in different ways by the soaring cost of living - who are getting some support from their local club.
Some are offering cheaper, or free, tickets but - as Mr Kavanagh points out - that is not always appropriate for someone who cannot afford the petrol or fare to get to a match in the first place.
So instead, much of the support is practical, ranging from a cafe at Cambridge United and free wi-fi at Middlesbrough, to debt advice at Rochdale and a warm room at Rotherham United.
revor Birch, chief executive of the EFL, says it means ""real tangible help"" for those people hit hardest by the cost of living.
""While EFL clubs support people all year round, we recognise that now more than ever we should come together and maximise the power of our network to support people who are struggling,"" he says.
Data provided to BBC News by debt charity Citizens Advice shows why such support is often necessary.
It carries out debt assessments for people seeking help. While people typically owe less money than equivalent clients in the past, an increasing proportion are in the red after covering their basic outgoings, known as a negative budget.
As a whole, those going through debt assessments typically have 1p left at the end of the month after essential spending - such as food, heating and rent - reflecting the impact of rising prices and bills.
why so many people, possibly football supporters themselves, need extra support - some of which is being provided by their local club.

politics	Tory leadership: Kemi Badenoch backs Rishi Sunak to be the next PM	"Kemi Badenoch has ruled herself out of the race to be the next prime minister, throwing her weight behind Rishi Sunak.
Ms Badenoch - who made a big impact in the last Tory leadership contest - said in The Times that Mr Sunak was ""the serious, honest leader we need"".
rnational trade secretary joins a growing list of Sunak backers, even though the ex-chancellor has yet to officially declare he is standing.
Former prime minister Boris Johnson is also gaining supporters.
But claims by his campaign team that he had reached the threshold of 100 MPs needed to secure place in the first round of voting were met with scepticism by Mr Sunak's supporters.
ged the Johnson camp to release a list of names, as the number of MPs to have gone on the record as backing the ex-PM is considerably smaller.
BBC understands Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson were due to meet face-to-face earlier on Saturday. It was postponed for reasons that are not clear, but may still go ahead later. Neither side is commenting on what is to be discussed, although there is speculation they will seek to avoid a potentially damaging contest.
Only Penny Mordaunt has officially launched a campaign to be the next PM, since nominations opened on Friday.
Ms Badenoch is seen as a rising star on the right of the Conservative Party but she had not attracted any public support from MPs urging her to stand for leader this time.
She said: ""Mrs Thatcher won the public's trust and three elections in a row by making it about us, not about her. We need someone who can do the same. I believe that person is Rishi Sunak.""
Another leading figure on the right of the party, former Brexit secretary Lord Frost, has also backed Mr Sunak.
According to the BBC's running total of MPs who have gone on the record with support, Mr Sunak has 122 backers, to Mr Johnson's 53 and Ms Mordaunt's 23.
fuls have until 14:00 BST on Monday to find 100 backers. If any candidate reaches 156 nominations out of the 357 Tory MPs the race will be reduced to two candidates, as there will not be enough MPs left to support a third candidate.
It will then go to an online ballot of the Conservative party membership, with the result to be announced on Friday. 
But if the party's MPs get behind just one candidate, we could have a new prime minister by Monday afternoon.
Polling suggests Mr Johnson would be favourite to win a members' vote. 
Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg and Transport Secretary Anne Marie Trevelyan -  plus former home secretary Priti Patel - have thrown their weight behind Mr Johnson.
His supporters say he is the only contender to have the backing of the voting public after winning the 2019 general election. Mr Johnson still has a Parliamentary investigation hanging over him over whether he lied to MPs about Covid lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street.
Some leading figures in the party have reacted with horror to the prospect of a second Johnson premiership, with former leader Lord Hague warning the party would enter a ""death spiral"".
Mr Sunak's supporters include former chancellor and health secretary Sajid Javid, Security Minister Tom Tugendhat and former deputy prime minister Dominic Raab.
Pointing to the parliamentary probe facing Mr Johnson, Mr Raab told the BBC: ""We cannot go backwards. We cannot have another episode of the Groundhog Day, of the soap opera of Partygate"". 
He said he was ""very confident"" Mr Sunak would stand, adding: ""I think the critical issue here is going to be the economy. Rishi had the right plan in the summer and I think it is the right plan now.""
Launching her campaign on Twitter on Friday, Ms Mordaunt said she would ""unite our country, deliver our pledges and win the next [general election]"".
Mordaunt backer Conservative MP Bob Seely said ""I think we owe the country a collective responsibility to apologise"" and said he believes Ms Mordaunt has the best chance of providing ""unity and leadership"" within the party.
Among those to have ruled themselves out of the race are Defence Secretary Ben Wallace - who has said he is ""leaning"" towards supporting Mr Johnson - and current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt. 
Boris Johnson was ejected from office in July after a string of scandals, but the replacement chosen by the Tory Party, Liz Truss, lasted just 45 days, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. 
She stood down on Thursday, after a series of humiliating U-turns forced on her by an adverse reaction to her tax policies in the financial markets."	/news/uk-politics-63353097
technology	Elon Musk, Twitter and the mysterious X app	"It was beginning to feel like Elon Musk and Twitter were locked in an eternal dance.
And then it came to an abrupt end - for now at least - with a short, succinct letter from Musk's lawyers to Twitter's, which announced that he intended to buy the firm after all, and an enigmatic tweet from Musk himself to his 107 million followers about creating ""X, the everything app"".
gan in April 2022. Musk bought up some Twitter shares and was invited to join its board. He initially accepted, and then declined. Then came the first bombshell - he wanted to buy the whole platform instead.
witter went into defensive mode and tried to prevent him from becoming a majority shareholder. Then he offered a $44bn takeover package - more than the firm was worth - and its investors pushed for it to go ahead. 
witter accepted. Then, bombshell number two: Elon Musk argued that the company's estimation of the amount of spam and bot accounts on the platform was inaccurate. Both parties dug in their heels. 
r been resolved - and led to Musk saying he was pulling out. But it is important - because if Twitter really is bloated with stuff that isn't real, that makes it a much smaller and less attractive proposition than it may appear.
re was speculation that Musk's offer had been made impulsively, and his plan to finance the deal, which involved selling off some of his shares in his electric car firm Tesla, had made investors in that company nervous, forcing him to look for an exit strategy.
In less than a fortnight's time, the two warring parties were due to face each other in court because by this point, Twitter had done its own U-turn and wanted to force the sale through. There was a $1bn termination fee at stake for either party if it walked away.
re had already been some embarrassing revelations revealed in court documents - such as private messages which showed that Elon Musk and Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal had fallen out, and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey had tried to mediate.
Was there more to come during the deposition? It is possible that Mr Musk is buying himself some time and saving face, ahead of a court case that many predicted he was unlikely to win.
As for his tweet about ""X, the app for everything"" - we will have to watch this space. He could well be eyeing something along the lines of the hugely successful Chinese app WeChat. That's a kind of ""super app"" which incorporates a lot of different services including messaging, social media, payments and food orders - there is as yet no such thing in the west.
Compared with its rivals, Twitter is a comparatively small platform with around 300m monthly users, and it has never experienced the exponential growth of say TikTok or Instagram. But it is considered influential, and is widely used by politicians, world leaders and businesses, to share comment and opinion. 
When he first announced his intentions to buy Twitter, Mr Musk said he wanted to open the platform up to more ""free speech"" and less moderation - a tricky line for any social media firm to walk and keep in line with various regional regulations and laws on hate speech.
While the news is undoubtedly good for Twitter the business, whose shares rose by 20% after the lawyer's letter was revealed, Musk may decide to turn the platform into a very different kind of playground. This could alienate its current fans - but also bring in a whole new crowd. Either way, CEO Parag Agrawal is probably dusting down his CV."	/news/technology-63141272

entertainment	The cemetery in Bedford inspiring authors and artists	"A cemetery that has become an unlikely inspiration for artists and writers is the subject of a new book.
Foster Hill Road Cemetery in Bedford is the burial place of a suffragette, a religious leader and a Polish freedom-fighter, among other names.
Bedford's Victorian Cemetery goes into detail about a number of famous people who are buried at the site.
Bestselling author Ruth Hogan is one of those inspired by it, having featured it in The Wisdom of Sally Red Shoes.
Adrian Bean, who complied the book, said: ""It's not an eerie place, it's a beautiful place with lots of trees, a lovely landscape, a lot of memories and a place that you can see for miles.
""It's the last resting place for generations of people who laughed, played games with their children, dreamt dreams, and mostly tried to make their world a better place.""
Some of the people buried in the cemetery are suffragette activist Ellen Oliver, Mabel Barltrop, who believed she was a prophet, and Danuta Gruszczynska-Alasinska, who served in the underground Polish army during the Nazi occupation in World War Two.
Others include 32 soldiers of a Scottish Highland unit, Lady Eve, the aunt of World War Two codebreaker Alan Turing, and brewer Charles Wells.
Author Ms Hogan said: ""I love the cemetery because it's a sanctuary, not just for the amazing wildlife that live there but also from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. 
""I find inspiration in the cemetery because it is a place full of stories. 
""On every headstone an entire life and death is summarised in just a few words, leaving plenty to the imagination. 
""The cemetery is also a brilliant place for me to find names for my characters.""
Artist Marisa Straccia has created illustrations for the book. 
She grew up close to the site and used to walk past it to visit Bedford Park next door.
""My artwork is inspired by a lot of folk stories and folk song and having that link to ordinary people through the years,"" she said.
It was also a place when she was a teenager that she went for solace with her friends after a breakup with a boyfriend.
""I'm grateful to whoever was buried to listening to my woes, and now it's my chance to say 'thank you' to them as now we can listen to their stories.""
Ms Straccia said of the 16 paintings she created for the book, her favourite was of Mabel Barltrop, who created the Panacea Society in the town in 1919. She believed Jesus would return to Bedford.
""I liked the idea of showing the glamourous version of her. It's a glamourous picture of Mabel in her prime, else how would she have had so many followers?""

business	Twitter investor sues Elon Musk and platform over takeover bid	"A Twitter investor is suing Elon Musk and the social media platform over the handling of the billionaire's $44bn (Â£34.9bn) bid for the company. 
ges he violated California corporate laws in a number of ways.
It accuses the Tesla boss of ""wrongful conduct"" as his ""false statements and market manipulation have created 'chaos' at Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco"".
witter shares are around 27% lower than Mr Musk's $54.20 offer price.
roposed class action lawsuit was filed this week at the US District Court for the Northern District of California by investor William Heresniak, who said he was acting ""on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated"".
A class-action is a lawsuit that has been filed or is defended by an individual acting on behalf of a group of people.
wsuit claimed Mr Musk benefitted financially by delaying the disclosure of his significant stake in Twitter, and his plan to become a board member of the company.
It also claimed that several tweets posted by Mr Musk, who is a regular Twitter user with more than 95m followers, were ""misleading"".
It included a post in which Mr Musk said his takeover bid for the social media firm was on hold because of his doubts over the number of fake accounts on the platform.
weet on 13 May ""constituted an effort to manipulate the market for Twitter shares as he knew about the fake accounts,"" the lawsuit said.
It also said Mr Musk ""doubled down"" on his allegations four days later, by stating on Twitter that the deal ""cannot go forward"".
On Friday, Frank Bottini, who is one of the lawyers representing the Twitter investors, told the BBC that the lawsuit was filed as Mr Musk ""continues to disparage the company he wants to buy for $44bn in an effort to renegotiate the purchase price"".
""The complaint we filed in San Francisco seeks to hold Musk liable for his unlawful conduct,"" Mr Bottini said.
Mr Musk's lawyers and Tesla did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on Friday.
witter declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.
Analysts have speculated that Mr Musk may be looking for ways to lower his takeover offer or walk away from the deal.
He has tweeted several times that he was concerned about the number of fake accounts, or bots, on Twitter.
A bot is a software programme that sends out automated posts and is often associated with misinformation on social media platforms.
Mr Musk has also hinted that he may seek to pay less for Twitter than the $44bn agreed with the company's board in March.
Speaking at a technology conference earlier this month, he said striking a deal at a lower price was ""not out of the question"".
Earlier this month, a Florida pension fund also challenged Mr Musk's move to buy Twitter as it claimed a deal could not be struck in months as planned.
Orlando Police Pension Fund said Mr Musk was an ""interested shareholder"" in Twitter, as he had made agreements with major shareholders, including its co-founder Jack Dorsey, before he offered to buy the business.
Citing the law in the US state of Delaware, where Twitter is incorporated, it said the deal should not be allowed to close before 2025.
fund did not disclose its stake in the social media platform, although it said it has been ""a beneficial owner of Twitter common stock"" at ""all relevant times"".

Illustrator Jack Skivens' first children's book sees the creatures visiting some of the city's best-known landmarks before returning to their positions before sunrise. 
In Night of the Animal Wall, the vulture sits on the old Brains brewery tower waiting for passers-by to drops chips on Caroline Street, fondly known as Chippy Alley.

Jack, 35, said the book was inspired by both his own childhood memories of visiting the 130-year-old statues and the questions of his curious four-year-old twins.
""It was always really special and really big and exciting to go to Cardiff,"" said Jack, who grew up in nearby Caerphilly and now lives a few miles away in Pontypridd.  
""The animals on the wall always took my interest, there was always this eeriness about them - it's just such a strange collection of animals.""
He found himself wondering if the animals could be more than mere statues. 
""I had ideas when I was younger about them coming to life, I had a really active imagination,"" he said. 
""It was kind of a nice place for your mind to wander off to, thinking about those animals wandering around and kind of what they would do.""
During the Covid pandemic lockdowns he began illustrating the stone animals.
""The idea was nature was thriving in our absence without cars and what-have-you and were able to explore new territory,"" he said.

""They're really excited for it, there's that experience of taking them to these places and they're actually real, watching their minds and seeing the questions they have afterwards has been really, really fun,"" he said. 
Cardiff Castle's animal wall has been delighting adults and children alike since it was installed in 1890.

re were originally eight animals on the wall - a pair of lions holding shields, a lioness, a polar bear, a sea lion, a wolf, an ape and a hyena, and it was situated directly in front of the castle.
In the 1920s the wall was moved to its present position west of the castle after road widening on Castle Street, and a further seven animals by sculptor Alexander Carrick were added  - the lynx, vulture, beaver, leopard, raccoon, pelican and anteater. The polar bear was also replaced by a bear.

technology	Bristol councillors vote for inquiry into social media checks	"Councillors want an independent inquiry after council staff monitored parents of children with special educational needs on social media.
Leaked documents showed Bristol City Council officers watched the accounts of parents for posts critical of the authority. 
A report published in September cleared the Labour-controlled council of wrongdoing.
But on Tuesday councillors voted for an independent inquiry to be launched.   
Labour insisted the initial investigation absolving the council had been ""genuine"". 
Several months' worth of tweets were collected by council staff to use as evidence that two parents running a charity receiving local government money had been ""campaigning"" against the council, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reported. 
rents were part of the Bristol Parent Carer Forum (BPCF), which advocated for better services for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). 
Officers collected and shared a dossier of critical social media posts, cross-referencing anonymous Twitter accounts with private Facebook wedding photos.
wo of the parents involved told councillors they felt ""humiliated"" by senior council staff. 
In July, council chiefs withdrew support for BPCF receiving government funding, but insisted the decision had nothing to do with the social media monitoring.    
Speaking at a council meeting on Tuesday evening, Conservative Councillor Geoff Gollop said: ""The administration appears not to have condemned these actions, and by not condemning them that means they appear to have condoned them.
""It doesn't matter to me whether this was systematic or random, it was wrong -  yet we employ people who actually think it was right. 
""Only an independent inquiry will tell us who was responsible for this.""
Asher Craig, cabinet member for education, said: ""I take issue with how this motion (for an independent inquiry) talks about the council's legal team - implying their investigation wasn't genuine. 
""There is a difference between not agreeing with the outcome of a report and questioning the integrity of those who wrote it.
""Any suggestion that this council was carrying out covert surveillance on parents is just ridiculous. But if councillors want to spend taxpayers' money on an external investigation, then that's fine.""

Bristol mayor Marvin Rees asked for the inquiry to be independently chaired, and for the cost in both time and money to be published.  
""Take ownership of the consequences of the actions you take when you're looking for your next angle or position of attack,"" he told opposition councillors.
It's unclear when the inquiry will be set up or who will chair it.

business	Rolls-Royce car workers win record pay package worth up to 17.6%	"Workers at luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce have secured a pay deal worth 17.6%, unions say, averting the possibility of industrial action.    
About 1,200 workers at the firm's plant in West Sussex will receive a 10% pay rise and one-off bonus of Â£2,000.
Many industries are being hit by strikes as workers seek pay increases to keep up with rising living costs.
Rail workers began another 48-hour walkout on Friday and more strikes in other industries will start next week.
Figures out this week showed that prices increased by 10.7% in the year to November, the fastest rate for about 40 years.
Separate data showed that the gap between wage growth in the public and private sector remained near a record high.
Workers in the private sector saw their average pay rise at an annual rate of 6.9% between August and October, according to official figures, compared with wage growth of just 2.7% for public sector employees.
Unite union said Rolls workers at the Goodwood factory, which builds some of the world's most expensive luxury cars, had been ""repeatedly denied... a proper pay rise"".
A consultative ballot by the union had seen a 98% vote in favour of industrial action if the demand for a pay rise in line with inflation was not met. 
Unite said the agreement was the largest single pay deal in the history of the Goodwood plant.
""This is a top-notch pay deal for the Rolls-Royce workforce,"" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham.
""Rolls-Royce Motor Cars are famous and iconic because of the workers' craft and expertise. For years the workers had been underpaid and undervalued but that's changing. The union has won the best pay deal since the site opened.""

technology	Twitter misleading the public, whistleblower says	"witter's former head of security, Peiter Zatko, has told US lawmakers the firm is ""misleading the public"" about how secure the platform really is.
He claimed Twitter was ""a decade behind"" security standards, that users' data is not sufficiently protected and that too many staff have access to it. 
Mr Zatko was giving evidence following an 84-page long whistleblowing complaint he made about security practices inside the social network.
He was fired by the firm in January.
He also said ""one-time fines"" imposed by regulators over breaches of rules on data protection ""didn't bother Twitter at all"". 
In his damning testimony, Mr Zatko described an organisation prioritising revenue generation above everything else.
At the start of the hearing he grew tearful about his role as a whistleblower, saying it was not a decision he had taken lightly.
""I'm risking my career and reputation... if something good comes out of it five or ten years down the line, it will be worth it,"" he said later on.
He also said he still thought Twitter offered a good service but laughed when asked whether he would buy it - a wry nod to the saga of Elon Musk's deal.
""Depends on the price,"" he said.
During his questioning, Mr Zatko said that employees had expressed concerns to him that Twitter was carrying advertising from ""organisations which may or may not be associated with the Chinese government"", a potential national security risk.
When he raised concerns with Twitter executives he was told it would be ""problematic"" to lose that revenue stream, he said.
He also said he was troubled by Twitter's attitude to other national security issues he had raised. He said ""half the company"" were engineers and they all had access to users' personal information.
It is believed around 4,000 employees had access to this data. He said he was worried that rogue employees had the power to take information without leaving a trace. 
He added that there was a danger that employees could ""dox"" users, where private information is posted online, though he had not seen this happen.
He said Twitter does not log the activity of employees who access private data - which surprised him.
He also said that Twitter's security systems made it difficult to monitor potential espionage. In a previous statement Mr Zatko said that an Indian agent had been employed by the company . 
""The company did not in fact disclose to users that it was believed by the executive team that the Indian government had succeeded in placing agents on the company payroll,"" Mr Zatko said last month.
He has previously supported Elon Musk's claim that the platform has more spam and fake accounts than it has admitted - though he didn't elaborate on this.
His testimony focussed on national security issues - and is not officially connected with Mr Musk's attempt to pull out of his deal to buy Twitter for $44bn - that case is due to begin in October.
Even so, the flurry of accusations from a former senior employee will not help Twitter's case.
Mr Zatko was personally hired by Twitter's co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, after a high-profile attack of the platform's celebrity accounts. 
whistleblower said that peoples' personal information was put at risk. Information held about users includes: 
uld enable an individual to be targeted in the real world, he said.
Mr Zatko has previously worked for the US government and Google, and is well-regarded in the information security community.
His lawyer John Tye described him as ""a pretty remarkable guy"".
Senator Chuck Grassley from the US Judiciary Committee said in his opening remarks that Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal had declined to attend the hearing.
Mr Agrawal's last activity on his own Twitter account was a re-tweet of the firm's chairman Bret Taylor in response to Elon Musk on 4 August.

entertainment	Kevin Spacey faces New York jury in sexual assault court case	"Kevin Spacey appeared in a New York court on Thursday to face an accusation by fellow actor Anthony Rapp that he was sexually abused by the actor as a minor.
Star Trek: Discovery star Rapp, now 50, filed a complaint against Spacey in 2020, for advances and an alleged sexual assault at a party in Manhattan in 1986, when he was 14.
House of Cards star, 63, has always denied the allegation.
Rapp is seeking $40m (Â£36m) in damages.
During opening arguments in the case, presided over by Judge Lewis Kaplan, Rapp's lawyer Peter Saghir told a jury of six men and six women that Spacey, then in his late 20s, committed ""unacceptable"" acts against his then-teenaged client, ""intentionally to satisfy the drive of his sexual desires"".
ged assault, at Spacey's New York apartment, ""never should have happened"", Mr Saghir continued. ""He was 14 years old.""
Spacey, who went on to star in films like The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, has kept a fairly low profile since the allegation, which emerged in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which highlighted widespread abuse in the film industry.
Last month, Rapp spoke about his accusation in an interview with BuzzFeed News.
Spacey responded online, offering his ""sincerest apology"" to Rapp for any ""deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour"", saying he did not recall the alleged incident.
Rapp filed a civil lawsuit after a 2020 criminal charge of sexual assault was dismissed by a judge. 
According to court documents, Rapp claims that during the party 35 years ago, Spacey lifted him up and that his hand ""grazed"" his buttocks. He claims Spacey then placed him back down on a bed and ""briefly placed his own clothed body partially beside and partially across"" his own.
He told the court there had been ""no kissing, no undressing, no reaching under clothes, and no sexualised statements or innuendo,"" during the alleged incident which lasted no more than two minutes. 
His lawyer said Spacey's behaviour was ""wrong and frankly unacceptable."" ""This was not horseplay,"" he added.
Spacey's own lawyer Jennifer Keller, however, told the jury that such an assault ""never happened at all"".
She noted how down the years, Rapp had ""repeated the same false story [but] never repeated it to the police"", arguing he had done so for ""attention [and] sympathy"" because he never became an international star.
Ms Keller previously told AFP in an email: ""We look forward to his vindication by an impartial jury.""
rial is expected to last for two weeks, and, if found guilty, Spacey faces significant damages.
In August, a judge ordered Spacey to pay House of Cards producers $31m (Â£25.5m) for the costs involved in removing him from the series following a string of allegations of sexual misconduct.
He appeared at the Old Bailey in London in July to ""strenuously"" deny allegations of sexual assault by three other men, dating back 17 years to when Spacey was artistic director at The Old Vic theatre.
A trial will take place in June 2023, with a pre-hearing expected to take place early next year."	/news/entertainment-arts-63169572

quates to three Covid deaths in every million in China, compared with 3,000 per million in the US and 2,400 per million in the UK, although direct comparisons between countries are difficult.
While China's zero-Covid policy has clearly saved lives, it has also dealt a punishing blow to the economy and ordinary people's lives.
untry slightly relaxed some of those restrictions a few weeks ago. 
It cut quarantine for close contacts from seven days in a state facility to five days and three days at home, and stopped recording secondary contacts which allowed many more people to avoid having to quarantine.
Officials have also sought to avoid enforcing blanket lockdowns of the kind endured by the largest city, Shanghai, earlier this year.
But faced with a renewed surge in cases in Beijing, as well as the first deaths from the virus in months, officials have already implemented some restrictions in several districts, with shops, schools and restaurants closed.
ral city of Zhengzhou is also to enforce an effective lockdown for 6 million residents from Friday, officials announced.
It follows violent protests at a vast industrial complex belonging to iPhone manufacturer Foxconn. The firm has apologised for a ""technical error"" in its payment systems.

Other stories of suffering and desperation have been shared online where they have fuelled public resentment.
Last week, reports that a baby in Zhengzhou died because her medical care was delayed by Covid restrictions prompted a huge outcry.
Among some of the most severe responses to Covid this year:
word came suddenly last night that our housing compound would be locked down with all residents confined to their homes.
urprise in China anymore. At any point, a single infection or being linked to an infection can mean not being allowed out.
Beijing is in the middle of a major Covid outbreak but, even before then, visiting a shopping mall or a building where an infected person had been meant going into home quarantine.
Right now, in the capital's vast Chaoyang district most businesses are closed. In thousands of tower blocks, all residents have been ordered to remain indoors for the next few days initially.
r that this is being replicated in cities right across the country.
In the regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, the lockdowns have gone on for months.
At the beginning of 2023, this country will be heading into its fourth year of this crisis and, whether it is true or not, zero-Covid has a never-ending feeling to it.
People are completely worn out by the pandemic and the government's economy-destroying response to it.
fficials have not explained where the off ramp is, has only added to the uncertainty.
Scientists here can also see that China's vaccination rates are way too low, especially amongst vulnerable groups. What is more, not enough resources have been diverted into expanding medical facilities to cope with a massive influx of patients following any opening-up.
In the short term though, my compound has now told me that, after several rounds of mass testing, we are allowed to leave.
For most residents this will not make much difference though because hardly anything outside is open, including their workplaces.
China is the last major economy still pursuing a Covid eradication process with mass testing and lockdown rules, and virus cases are being recorded in 31 provinces.
Part of the reason is that vaccination levels are lower than in other developed nations, and only half of people aged over 80 have their primary vaccinations.
China has refused to import vaccines despite evidence that its homemade jabs have not proved as effective.
President Xi Jinping argues that strict curbs are needed to protect the country's large elderly population.
Zero-Covid has come to define his rule and the authoritarian bureaucracy at his disposal like almost no other policy.
It projects a veneer of control and stability in the run-up to March when China's equivalent of a parliament will convene to choose Mr Xi as president for a third time.
""Lockdowns prevent Covid outbreaks from spreading,"" William Hurst, professor of Chinese development at Cambridge University, told BBC News recently. ""But they also exert incredibly strict social control."""	/news/world-asia-china-63739617
technology	Nearly a quarter of Earth's seafloor now mapped	"Slowly but surely the proportion of the global ocean floor that's been properly mapped is rising.
It's now up to just shy of a quarter of the total area under water - at 23.4%.
Better seafloor maps help us with navigation and conservation, among many other uses.
Some 10 million sq km (3.8 million sq miles) of new bathymetric (depth) data was added in the past year. This is an area broadly equivalent to the land surface of Europe.
update was given at the second UN Ocean Conference, taking place this week in Lisbon, Portugal.
Much of this additional data comes not from recent mapping efforts, however, but simply as a result of governments, institutions and companies agreeing to open up their archives. 
It's thought a further 10-15% is still squirrelled away on servers, in part because the owners worry they might be giving away commercial or defence secrets if they release the information.
""But they really needn't worry,"" said Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of Seabed 2030, the organisation that is trying to corral world efforts to obtain a complete picture of Earth's ocean bottom.
""One of the messages we're trying to get across is that we don't require high-resolution data. Hi-res is nice; we can work with it. But lower resolution is perfectly acceptable. 
""One depth value in an area the size of a European football pitch, 100m by 100m or thereabouts, isn't going to give away national or commercial secrets.""
knowledge is needed for a host of reasons.
Sea maps are essential for safe navigation, obviously, but also for fisheries management and conservation. Marine wildlife tends to congregate around the underwater mountains. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.
In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water. This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a pivotal role in moving heat around the planet.
At the moment, our knowledge of just over three-quarters of the planet's underwater terrain comes only from low-resolution satellite measurements that have inferred the presence of tall seamounts and deep valleys from the gravitational influence these features have on the sea surface. Water piles up over the mass of a large submarine mountain and dips slightly where there is a trench.
It's super smart but an underwater mountain that's hundreds of metres tall can still fail to show up in such observations. 
UK's new polar ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, is equipped to map millions of sq km of ocean bottom over its career. The above image shows the ship's hull in dry dock. The yellow rectangle in the centre is a cover made of a synthetic material over the 8m-long array of transmitting transducers for the deep-water multibeam echosounding system. 
Seabed 2030, which is funded by Japan's Nippon Foundation, is encouraging anyone who ventures away from the land to switch on their sonar equipment and take depth soundings. And this isn't just about measurements from big ships; small ocean-going yachts fitted with data loggers can also make a contribution.
One of Seabed 2030's stars is the American adventurer Victor Vescovo. The Texan financier is using a submersible to visit the deepest places in the world's oceans, but everywhere he goes his support ship switches on its echosounder.
""We have a 'map the gap' strategy,"" Mr Vescovo told BBC News.
""We're not a commercial outfit so we don't have to follow the most fuel-efficient routes. When we go on an expedition we ask [Seabed 2030], 'what are your priority areas?'; and we divert a little bit to cover those areas."" 
former US Navy reservist has himself contributed over 3 million sq km.
It's clear, however, that to come close to obtaining a full picture of the shape of Earth's ocean bottom, there will need to be a step change in approach and capability. Many parts of the world are so remote, few ships will visit them, let alone acquire depth data in those regions. 
map these places is going to require direct tasking of autonomous or semi-autonomous technologies.
re is a glimpse of how this will work in one line of data featured in the map at the top of this page. It was gathered by the Saildrone Surveyor on a cruise between San Francisco and Honolulu last year.
During this 28-day voyage, the robot boat mapped 22,000 sq km of seafloor. 
Saildrone Surveyor is 22m in length. But truly huge autonomous vessels are coming.
marine robotics company Ocean Infinity is currently building a fleet of 78m-long ships in Vietnam. Regulations will probably mean they have to be lean-crewed for the near future, but the goal eventually is to have them roving the ocean without anyone onboard. Their work would be overseen from satellite-linked control centres in the UK, the US and a third location somewhere in Asia.
Such ships could be sent out on long missions to map hard to reach areas at much lower cost than would be incurred by a conventional crewed vessel.
Progress to full mapping of the seafloor was discussed in a side meeting at this week's UN Ocean Conference. And while the participants recognised new technologies were essential to fulfilling the quest, Dr Lucy Woodall cautioned that the 2030 project would fail unless it engaged all communities with an interest in the data. 
She cited examples of companies going into coastal areas to map the seafloor and then not sharing any of the information with the local people whose livelihoods depended on those waters.
""I would argue to those of you in the room who think technology has got to be the way - I would argue that, actually, people are the way because unless people are asking the questions, unless we have a dialogue with all the voices in the room, then we're not going to ask, and therefore we can't answer, those right questions,"" the chief scientist with Nekton, a UK-based oceans NGO, told the meeting."	/news/science-environment-61986359
health	Strep A: Month's antibiotics supply 'exhausted in 48 hours'	"A month's supply of antibiotics was exhausted in less than 48 hours last week in Northern Ireland due to the rise in strep A infections, the Department of Health has said.
Demand for antibiotics remains at an ""exceptional level"", it added.
However, it said the system is working hard to resupply quickly.
It comes as figures show that the number of children attending the Royal Victoria Hospital's emergency department has fallen slightly.
ghest daily number of attendances over the past five days was 194 and that has now fallen to 173. 
BBC News NI understands that over the past week, Belfast Health Trust's online symptom tool has had over 12,000 hits from concerned parents.  
While it is too early to say that cases of strep A have peaked in Northern Ireland, there is some reassurance in the fact that, this week, the number of children attending the Royal Victoria Hospital's emergency department is down.
Belfast Health Trust said the still-relatively high number does not reflect strep A or scarlet fever. 
While wards are described as being busy, it is understood that children are being treated for a range of infections, with strep A cases in low numbers.
In a statement on the supply of antibiotics, the Department of Health said: ""While demand is well in excess of what is usual for this time of year, the system has been working hard to replenish stocks as quickly as possible.
""Wholesalers are carefully managing the volumes available to them to ensure that supplies are available to those in greatest need.""
rtment added that the surge in demand is being seen across the UK and that the supply chain ""has responded positively... with suppliers increasing manufacturing capacity and fast-tracking delivery of ingredients required for production"".
On Monday, the department said that deliveries of antibiotics to treat strep A were being sped up to reach wholesalers and pharmacies in the coming days.
Most strep A infections are mild - a sore throat or a skin infection that can be easily treated with antibiotics.
But some people who catch it can get very sick.
As of last Thursday, 15 children had died across the UK following invasive strep A infections since September.

technology	Xbox v PlayStation: Giants clash over Call of Duty	"Xbox owner Microsoft has hit back at claims its plan to buy the maker of Call of Duty may unfairly affect its rivals, including Sony, which owns PlayStation.
Microsoft wants to buy Activision Blizzard, which also makes Overwatch and Candy Crush, for $68.7bn (Â£59.2bn).
UK watchdog looking into the plan has said Microsoft could use Activision games to ""out-compete"" its rivals.
Microsoft said it still hoped the deal would be closed by June 2023.
Competition regulators in Saudi Arabia and Brazil have already approved it. 
But last month, the Competition and Markets Authority announced it would be asking an independent panel to look into the proposal.
Activision Blizzard is one of the world's largest video game developers and publishers, and the Call of Duty franchise has attracted millions of players.
And the CMA suggested buying it could allow Microsoft to monopolise top games such as Call of Duty by making them available primarily on Xbox consoles, PCs and Game Pass, its cloud gaming service.
In a detailed account of its decision to launch an in-depth investigation, published today, the CMA says that ""Call of Duty is sufficiently important that losing access to it (or losing access on competitive terms) could significantly impact Sony's revenues and user base"". 
It also said that ""Microsoft has followed this approach in several past acquisitions of gaming studios, where it made future game releases from those studios exclusive in consoles to Xbox"".
Microsoft says it is committed to keeping Activision's existing titles, including Call of Duty, available on the PlayStation. 
But future titles could be treated differently. 
Microsoft already owns 23 games makers, including Minecraft maker Mojang, and Fallout and Skyrim creator Bethesda. 
Bethesda's upcoming Starfield game will now be an Xbox and PC exclusive, and the CMA suggested that this could also be the case for the studio's Elder Scrolls VI,  based on Microsoft's public statements.
Microsoft says:
And, In a report seen by BBC News, Microsoft calls the CMA's concerns ""a novel theory of harm, unsupported by precedent, economic literature or the evidence"".
In a statement, Sony said the firm believes the deal is ""bad for competition, bad for the gaming industry and bad for gamers themselves.
""This deal would give Microsoft's Xbox ecosystem a unique combination of tech and content, and hence a dominant position in gaming, with devastating consequences for consumers,  independent developers, and Sony itself,"" it added.

health	Cleidocranial dysplasia: The mum and son with a one-in-a-million condition	"""I don't have collarbones, so I can touch my shoulders together under my chin,"" says Karen Hunt.
""It's a party trick. There have to be some perks to my condition.""
Karen, 40, and her four-year-old son Jaiden have cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), a rare genetic condition that can affect teeth and bones.
People with CCD might have bones that form differently or are more fragile than normal, and certain ones like collarbones may be absent altogether.
After decades of obscurity, CCD is now gaining more public recognition, thanks to the Stranger Things star, Gaten Matarazzo, who has the condition.
It can be passed from a parent to a child, or can appear at random.
In Karen's case, her baby teeth were removed because they would not fall out naturally.
Her second teeth then struggled to come through and further surgery was needed to make that happen.
use people to look different, and Karen says she was bullied at secondary school because of this.
""It was awful,"" she said.
""People would ask 'what's wrong with your face? Why don't you have any teeth?'
""As an adult, I can answer those questions, and I want people to ask them. Knowledge is key to understanding difference,"" she added.
""That's what I want for my son. I want him to see me be confident about it and to embrace our unique look.""
Orthodontic surgery to bring her adult teeth through was so painful, Karen says, that she stopped midway, and now has gaps in her top teeth.
""I remember saying to the orthodontist, will I still look different if I have the work done?
""He told me I would, so I felt at the time it wasn't worth going through the pain.""
For her son Jaiden, CCD has had an even more serious effect. The enamel on his teeth is very thin, and all but four of his baby teeth have worn away or have had to be removed.
But Karen is hopeful that Jaiden's experience of life with the condition will be better than her own.
""I didn't have anyone to reach out to and I didn't know anyone else with the condition.
""My son has me, and I have experienced most of what he'll go through.
""We have this incredible nationwide network of people with CCD in the UK and we all support each other.
""The procedures Jaiden will have to go through are different these days, and hopefully he'll end up with a good set of teeth at the end of it.""
Around one in a million people has CCD, meaning it has received little attention historically. This is now starting to change.
Gaten Matarazzo, who stars as Dustin in the Netflix series Stranger Things, has been vocal in raising the profile of the condition.
He sent a message to a recent conference in the UK for people with CCD.
""Loving yourself isn't showing the parts of yourself you're confident in. It's showing off the parts of yourself that you're least confident in, in spite of your fear.""
w Karen views it, too.
She teaches her son to be happy and confident.
""He just gets on with it,"" she said.

technology	Nothing 1 phone quirky design aims to light up market	"WATCH: Zoe Kleinman's hands-on with the Nothing 1 phone
UK-based company Nothing has launched an Android phone it hopes will re-energise the smartphone market.
-looking Nothing 1 has a translucent back featuring hundreds of light-emitting diode (LED) lights that function as notifications.
Nothing raised more than $144m (Â£122m) in funding to develop the handset.
Backers include iPhone designer Tony Fadell, YouTuber Casey Neistat, and gaming channel Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin.
Nothing 1's creator, China-born Carl Pei, 32, who co-founded phone company OnePlus and is highly regarded in the smartphone industry, told BBC News he wanted to ""make tech fun again"" - for consumers and investors.
mpany says it has received more than 200,000 requests for pre-orders of the Â£399 phone - about half the price of an average iPhone - manufactured in China and India.
mpany also has ambitions to create a luxury product and Mr Pei says he hopes to collaborate with electric-car manufacturer Tesla.
Nothing has sold more than half a million units of its first product - wireless, noise-cancelling headphones Ear 1, launched in August - despite software teething problems.
But Nothing 1 - despite a fair amount of hype, not least because of the high-profile names behind it - has ""a mountain to climb"", according to Ben Wood, from CCS Insight.
""The smartphone market is frighteningly competitive and is dominated by Apple and Samsung, who have incredible resources,"" he said.
""The rest of the addressable market is a firefight between numerous Chinese manufacturers desperate to grab share, making it even harder for a new entrant to break into the segment. 
""Add in the current macroeconomic situation and cost-of-living pressure, and it means being successful will be a huge challenge.""
Globally, smartphones sales were down 17% in May, compared with last year, according to CounterPoint Research.
re are a number of reasons for this: 
""The big suppliers, they owe their bigger customers a lot of chips, they were really hesitant to bring in a new customer like us, a much smaller company,"" Mr Pei said.
""We had to spend so much time finding different suppliers and pitching to them why the market needs somebody like us.""

sports	Winter Olympics: Finnish skier Remi Lindholm suffers frozen penis in men's 50km cross-country	"Perhaps the worst part of it all for Finland's Remi Lindholm is that it was not even the first time it had happened.
Such was the chance of athletes suffering frostbite, freezing conditions at the Winter Olympics in Beijing had already seen the blue riband men's 50km cross-country ski delayed by an hour - and shortened to a 30km event.
But even those alterations could not save Lindholm from an ""unbearable"" fate.
mmediate concern for the 24-year-old, in the aftermath of completing the final event of his debut Olympic Games, was thawing out his frozen penis.
A heat pack eventually helped the Finn salvage the situation at the end of what was a gruelling race.
However, having spent almost one hour and 16 minutes out on the course in howling winds and appendage-threatening temperatures of -17C, he was, understandably, left in a tremendous amount of pain.
""You can guess which body part was a little bit frozen when I finished,"" Lindholm told Finnish media.
""It was one of the worst competitions I've been in. It was just about battling through.
""When the body parts started to warm up after the finish, the pain was unbearable.""

business	Warning energy bills may rise above Â£4,000 in April	"usehold energy bills could reach Â£4,347 a year from April after the government said it would scale back support, an analyst has estimated.
Cornwall Insight's forecast comes after the chancellor said the energy bill help, which had been due to last for two years, would be cut in April.
government said the most vulnerable would continue to be protected from soaring energy prices.
forecasts could change depending on movements in wholesale energy prices.
w Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced the change to the energy price support as part of a package of measures designed to save money after the government's mini-budget left a big projected hole in the public finances.
On Monday, he said ""it would not be responsible to continue exposing public finances to unlimited volatility in international gas prices"". 
government's Energy Price Guarantee, which limits the price that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, was originally put in place for two years from 1 October. 
Now it will only be in place for six months, covering this winter, with the Treasury reviewing the support given from April.
Under the current cap consumers still pay for the gas and electricity they use. A typical household - one that uses 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas a year and 2,900 kWh of electricity - currently faces an annual bill of Â£2,500. That is up from Â£1,277 last winter.
f support from April will be decided following a review, Mr Hunt said. He said those on lower incomes would be supported and there will be incentives to be more energy efficient.
Predictions from Cornwall Insight suggest that, for households that do not receive any support, a typical annual energy bill could be Â£4,347 in the spring, dropping to Â£3,722 next winter.
f the two-year cap will introduce a ""considerable amount of anxiety about the future again"", Nigel Pocklington, boss of renewable energy supplier Good Energy, told the BBC's Today programme.
Mr Pocklington, whose firm has about 300,000 customers, said that his reassurances to people were based on the government ""buffering them from the high levels of energy market through the winter"". 
However, on ""current calculations without the government support"", he estimated that the average energy bill would reach around Â£4,300 in April, dropping below Â£4,000 by the summer. 
""These are extraordinarily high levels compared with what we are used to paying,"" he said.  
Sharing this concern, Mary Starks, former executive director for consumers and markets at energy regulator Ofgem, told the Today programme that the move had put people back into a position of ""great uncertainty"".  
On the promise of targeted help, Ms Starks criticised the government for being ""very unclear"" because who will be affected and how it will work has not been explained. 
""Even extending eligibility to everyone on universal credit is administratively complicated.
""The number of households who will be struggling will be a lot bigger than that so there is more work needed to do the targeting,"" she added. 
riginal plan to cap prices for two years - thought to cost up to Â£150bn - was to be funded through government borrowing after the prime minister rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on oil and gas firms.
However, former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng followed it with plans to cut taxes by some Â£45bn.
Concerns about rising borrowing sparked turmoil on financial markets which spilled over into the mortgage market, where interest rates on loans have surged to 14-year highs.
On Monday, as he announced the review of the energy support, while also reversing Â£32bn worth of the planned tax cuts, Mr Hunt said he was doing ""what is necessary for economic stability"".
He added that the Energy Price Guarantee had been ""the biggest single expense"" of Mr Kwarteng's growth plan."	/news/business-63298057

Home Secretary Suella Braverman has met with police chief constables to discuss tactics used by some environmental protest groups, such as Just Stop Oil.
rime minister said: ""My view is that those who break the law should feel the full force of it.""
Speaking after the meeting at No 10 he said the police had his support.
Ms Braverman and policing minister Chris Philp met with police chiefs on Thursday and were joined by Mr Sunak at the start.
rime minister said the police were already being given new powers to clamp down on illegal protests and would have his full support in acting decisively to end ""the misery and disruption"" caused to ordinary families.
""I've said to them [the police] whatever they need from government they will have in terms of new powers, we're already giving them some, and I want to back them to use them.""
Following the talks in Downing Street, police chiefs described the meeting as ""constructive"". 
Chief Constable BJ Harrington said the police were ""not anti-protest, but we are anti-crime"".
A statement said: ""Police are committed to responding quickly and effectively to activists who deliberately disrupt people's lives through dangerous, reckless, and criminal acts.""
He said the meeting showed a commitment to tackling criminal activism while respecting lawful protest.
Earlier Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said Just Stop Oil protesters were being ""much less assertive"" because their suspected leaders are in custody.
He suggested that efforts by officers were having an effect, but admitted some criminal trials might not take place for two years amid delays in the criminal justice system. 
Speaking at the London Assembly, Sir Mark said he was ""absolutely determined"" that anything that goes beyond lawful, reasonable protest would be ""dealt with robustly"". 
Earlier this week, Jan Goodey - a Just Stop Oil protester - who took part in a protest which saw ""mile after mile"" of tailbacks on the M25 after climbing up a gantry was jailed for six months. He admitted causing a public nuisance.

health	Jayden Booroff death: 'Mistakes' over absconding patient's care	"Inadequate levels of communication, care and record keeping contributed to the death of a 23-year-old man who absconded from a mental health unit, an inquest jury concluded.
Jayden Booroff fled The Linden Centre, in Chelmsford, on 23 October 2020.
A jury gave a narrative conclusion which followed a two-week inquest at Essex Coroner's Court.
Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) said it made safety improvements.
Speaking after the inquest, Mr Booroff's mother, Michelle Booroff, said: ""Knowing that more could have been done to save my son's life is almost too much to bear, and I will simply never recover from my loss.""
Mr Booroff, from Chelmsford, was described as ""talented musically"" growing up but developed undiagnosed mental health problems.
He was admitted to The Linden Centre on 19 October 2020 after being sectioned for a second time.
Jurors heard that staff did not update his care plan while in the unit and previous written notes about suicidal thoughts and a risk of absconding were not transferred to the relevant electronic SBAR forms (situation, background, assessment, recommendation).
quest heard that his observations, made while he was receiving anti-psychotic medication, were decreased from four times per hour, to once per hour, without a ""detailed plan"".
A nurse, who Mr Booroff followed into a reception area before absconding, was not wearing her Pinpoint security alarm which she had left in her car.
He left the unit's Finchingfield Ward at 19:56 BST and his body was found at railway tracks nearly two hours later.
quest jury concluded:
jury said the response from police was ""appropriate"".
""I just wish he could be playing his piano and living out his life and his dreams and that got taken away from him, because of these fatal errors,"" added Ms Booroff.
She backed calls from other campaigners to upgrade a public inquiry, investigating EPUT patient deaths, to a statutory inquiry.
EPUT said it invested Â£40m in improvements and claimed the changes resulted in a 60% reduction in absconding between 2019 and 2021.
It said a security video intercom was fitted after the incident.
""I am sorry for the failings in the care provided to Jayden,"" said trust chief executive Paul Scott.
""We are committed to continuously improving to provide the best possible care for those who need us most.""

entertainment	The BBC's First Homosexual: How we made 1950s work into a play	"In 1957, the BBC broadcast its first radio documentary about gay men. The Homosexual Condition had taken three years to come to air, amid a climate of considerable oppression in which you could still be imprisoned for being gay.
umentary was later lost but, following the efforts of a Leicestershire academic and an award-winning writer, a play named The BBC's First Homosexual has been created about it which is having its first performance on Thursday. The people behind it explain the challenges they faced along the way.
Seven years ago Dr Marcus Collins was standing in the BBC Written Archives Centre in Reading feeling bored.
Marcus, an expert in social change in post-war Britain at Loughborough University, had grown tired of the project he was working on when his eye chanced upon something completely different - a large file, containing paperwork relating to a controversy in the 1950s.
Intrigued, he read on to discover the lost script of one of the BBC's first attempts to examine the lives of gay men - a documentary named The Homosexual Condition, which had been broadcast on the Home Service.
It had been recorded on 24 May 1954 but was considered so taboo that it had not been broadcast until 25 July 1957.
""The recording had been lost in the mists of time,"" he says. ""What was unusual was the amount of paperwork that was kept and the reason for that was that it provoked so much reaction at the time.""
As he examined the papers, Marcus found the original script for the documentary, as well as memos from those behind it and letters detailing the reaction from listeners - including one from a gay man who had described it as a calumny.
At the time the BBC made the documentary, people were being sent to prison for being gay.
""The question arose about whether you could actually have any homosexual people on the programme, given that it was a criminal offence,"" says Marcus.
rogramme makers eventually opted to interview somebody who had been sentenced for gross indecency but who appeared to consider himself ""reformed"".
Marcus admits such terminology would sit uneasily with a modern audience.
""It's a situation where you have a whole bunch of straight men who don't now much about homosexuality pronouncing on the subject with a great deal of certitude,"" he says.
""To me the programme is just farcical. There's a tremendous amount of ignorance at the time and not a lot of places to look to for expertise.
""All of the assumptions within the BBC about the broadcast tell you more about the person writing the memo than about what it was like to be gay in the 1950s.""
rogramme was mothballed for several years before eventually being broadcast at around the time of the Wolfenden Report which recommended a partial decriminalisation of homosexuality.
Following its broadcast and the subsequent reaction, the director general at the time - Sir Ian Jacob - committed to refrain from broadcasting any further content relating to homosexuality, apart from for ""special purposes"".
But, despite its flaws, positive things did emerge as a result of the broadcast. Much of the reaction was positive and reviews, Marcus says, were largely sympathetic.
rogramme's presenter C.R. Hewitt went on to help found the Homosexual Law Reform Society, which campaigned for changes to the laws that criminalised homosexuality.
""These kind of programmes were so rare they were actually quite important for people because they actually received some kind of recognition for their own identity,"" says Marcus.
As he read the script, he felt the process that had brought it into being was ripe for dramatisation.
Now working as a research fellow for the Arts and Humanities Research Council to work on events for the BBC's centenary year, he came into contact with playwright Stephen M Hornby. 
Stephen is currently the National Playwriting in Residence for LGBT+ History Month.
He has put together a play that focuses on three strands - parts of the verbatim transcript, the BBC's processes of making the documentary and a fictionalised account of a young man growing up in Scunthorpe and coming to terms with his sexuality.
g staged by Inkbrew Productions as a script-in-hand performance in the New Adelphi Studio at the University of Salford on Thursday but Marcus hopes it will become a full production early next year.
""We wanted to find a creative way of bringing these scripts back to life,"" he said. ""There's so much stuff in the BBC archives that captures those times and the very different attitudes.
""Those attitudes are a million miles away from many people's attitudes these days but that's all the more reason why we should be able to understand why people thought that way and how we have changed.""
""Turning a radio documentary made in 1954 into a stage play for now has some big challenges,"" says Dr Stephen M. Hornby.
Stephen specialises in writing plays based upon archive material but, in this case, he says there were particular difficulties.
""The basic concept of the original documentary is that an everyman journalist looks at a social problem, talks to so-called experts in different fields about it and comes to a balanced conclusion,"" he says.
""It's very different to how documentaries are made now.
""The experts don't actually possess much expertise and the view of homosexuality is an othering one.
""It's framed as a problem for society and as an illness of the individual that should be cured. So, it's basically a load of offensive nonsense.  How do you stage that?""
He decided the new work needed a narrative and a character for the audience to invest in.
""Firstly, there's a real story, which is of the internal struggle in the BBC to make the documentary,"" he says.
""There's only one man in the whole programme who talks openly about same sex experiences and he's paraded as a 'cured homosexual'.
""So, I wanted an actual homosexual to be the centre of the play. And that's the second story, which I've invented, of Tom, a working-class shop assistant from Scunthorpe.
""He acts as our window on to the period.  Through a series of monologues, he takes us with him as he discovers and experiments with his sexuality.
""He's in a void though as the culture around him tells him almost nothing about homosexuality, except for reports of a few high-profile men being arrested.
""His journey leads him ultimately to listening to the broadcast of the documentary on the BBC Home Service in 1957 and we see its life-changing impact upon him.
""We know today, something that he discovers then: the power of being seen.""
riginal documentary featured interviews with psychoanalysts claiming they could ""cure"" gay men - what is known today as the ""unethical and potentially harmful"" practise of conversion therapy.
""It's extraordinary that no-one would be given a platform now to say the things the 'experts' say in the documentary, but the conversion therapy many of them advocate is still being practised,"" says Stephen.
""That's why it's important that these parts of the lost queer past are exposed and interrogated, so that we can see where the present has come from and better understand it.
""The ghosts I've awoken in The BBC's First Homosexual are telling us something profound about Britain today.
""And the authority and credibility that the BBC gave to conversion therapy with this documentary is something that still haunts us all.
""It's a shameful part of their legacy which, with the commissioning of this play, they are finally beginning to face up to.""
Robert Seatter is the head of BBC History. He commissioned the work as part of the BBC 100 celebrations to mark the corporation's centenary.
He says: ""This fascinating project takes an interesting creative route to interpreting the BBC at the heart of a changing Britain - when sexual identity was finally starting to be more broadly discussed and debated.
""As part of the BBC's centenary, I'm delighted that our archives are being brought to life in this insightful and sometimes challenging way.""
He said the project was one of a number of pieces of work about the role the corporation has played in people's lives.
""The project is one of a number of research projects, exploring the BBC's impact on a range of different communities over time - from Black and Asian to LGBTQ, from health stories around the UK to young film makers using archive to tell their own contemporary stories,"" he says.

health	Surge in Strep A cases reported across Scotland	"Health officials have recorded more than 430 cases of Strep A in Scotland in two weeks.
Strep A infections are usually mild, causing illness ranging from a sore throat to scarlet fever, but can develop into a more serious invasive Group A Strep (iGAS) infection.
Jim McMenamin, of Public Health Scotland (PHS), said the numbers were similar to the last surge in 2017/18.
But despite six deaths across the UK no children have died in Scotland.
UK Health Security Agency said the rise in Strep A cases is most likely due to high amounts of the bacteria circulating and increased social mixing.
Parents are being urged to look out for symptoms and to promptly contact their GP or NHS24 if they have any concerns.
Dr McMenamin told BBC Reporting Scotland there had been an increase in the seasonal expected numbers of Group A Strep (GAS) infections.
miologist said: ""Over the last couple of weeks we have respectively seen 207 and 230 cases, which is very similar to what we have seen reported in the 2017/18 season but just an awful lot earlier than we might have seen in the past.""
In very rare occasions the bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause an iGAS infection.
PHS has received report of eight such cases in children under the age of 10 since September.
Dr Jim McMenamin, of Public Health Scotland, details some of the symptoms associated with Strep A infections
Dr McMenamin, head of health protection (infection services) at PHS, said Covid restrictions over the past two years meant many children had not encountered the streptococcal infections that are now beginning to be reported.
Among the symptoms that can develop is a rough rash which is pink in colour.
He said other things for parents to look our for is their child going off food or becoming irritable.
Dr McMenamin highlighted the importance of early diagnosis as antibiotics were ""very effective"" and usually had a positive impact within 24 hours.
But he added some patients would require hospital treatment.
Health officials confirmed on Friday that six children had died with iGAS - including five under 10-year-olds in England and a girl from Wales since September. 
No deaths have been confirmed in Scotland or Northern Ireland.
UK Health Security Agency said the last time there was an intensive period of Strep A infection in 2017-18 there were four deaths in England in the equivalent time frame.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, infectious diseases paediatrician Prof Beate Kampmann said there had been three times as much scarlet fever this year than was seen pre-pandemic: 
Prof Kampmann said: ""It starts off with a high fever, very sore throat and very red tongue, which has this sort of papillae - eventually developing a rash which feels a bit like sandpaper.
""The rash starts in the elbows and behind the neck. It tends to then peel after about ten days because the disease is caused by a toxin that is produced by this bacterium.""
She said children with a fever should be kept off school and added Group A Strep was ""very, very treatable"" with penicillin.
Virologist Dr Chris Smith said the general rise in Strep A infections could be due to a drop in immunity following the pandemic. 
He told BBC Breakfast: ""There's something about the vulnerability of the population and particularly younger people. 
""What has changed is that younger people have been through three years, almost, of relative isolation from each other. 
""They haven't caught the normal infections at the normal rates and at the normal times that normal children of that sort of age bracket would have done. 
""So, we wonder whether it is that we are seeing a big rash of cases all at once.""

business	Unite boss warns tens of thousands could strike over pay	"Sharon Graham said calls to limit pay rises were ""abhorrent""
general secretary of the UK's biggest private sector union has warned of a 'summer of discontent' over pay.
Sharon Graham said there could be hundreds of disputes involving tens of thousands of people if workers are made to ""pay the price for inflation"".
She said employers making a profit from workers should pay them a ""proper fair wage"".
Calls to limit pay rises to try to counter inflation were ""abhorrent"", she added.
Ms Graham, who recently took over Unite, said ordinary workers have already ""had a spring, summer, autumn and winter of discontent for years"".
""Any employer who can pay, who has made profit out of workers, has to pay a proper fair wage to those workers,"" she said.
But business group the CBI said that firms were helping employees and consumers where they could.
A CBI spokesperson said: ""With living costs at the highest level in decades, workers are understandably concerned about how they're going to cope with rising prices. Businesses too are being hit by soaring input costs.
""Wherever they can, firms are stepping-up to help by absorbing costs to keep prices down for consumers, as well as supporting their employees to cope with the cost-of-living spike.""
Speaking to the BBC in her first broadcast interview, Mrs Graham said that calls from the government and the Bank of England that workers should not ask for high wage rises were ""totally wrong"" and ""abhorrent"".
f thousands of members of her union were involved in disputes up and down the country, with many double digit pay rises won, for bus drivers, bin collectors, and factory workers, including in one case a rise of 23%, she said.
She said it was ""not militant"" to ask for pay rises matching or exceeding the rate that prices rise - inflation is currently running at more than 9%.
Last month Treasury minister Simon Clarke warned employees not to expect their wages to rise along with the soaring rate of inflation, saying wage rises help push up the cost of living.
His comments echoed those made earlier this year by Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, who warned workers to avoid asking for big pay rises.
She denied that there was a risk of a ""Seventies-style"" spiral of wages and prices which would prolong the period of very high inflation, instead blaming a rise in profits at big companies.
Ms Graham said that employers ""slashing the pay"" of those who worked through the pandemic was ""abhorrent"".
""I'm just not going to allow that to happen. And I don't think we should apologise for it,"" she said.
While the law now makes it more difficult for unions to take industrial action, demanding postal ballots that meet strict thresholds, Unite has changed its tactics, winning hundreds of strike mandates at a more local level.
Ms Graham said in some industries, workers' bargaining position was so strong that she anticipated reopening some final salary pension schemes, most of which have been closed of in recent years."	/news/business-62158667
politics	DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson regrets heart equipment protocol claim	"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said he regrets stating that difficulties in obtaining some medical equipment were linked to the NI Protocol. 
DUP leader made the claim in October saying it had led to delays for patients awaiting heart surgery.
But the Southern Health Trust and manufacturer Siemens said there was no supply delay because of the protocol. 
On Monday, Sir Jeffrey said he accepted he had placed information in the public domain that was inaccurate.
He said he had spoken to the Southern Health Trust after making the claim and said they had apologised to him. 
""I've had ongoing contact with the trust about this, the trust have apologised that the information I was given was inaccurate - not so much the fact this equipment had broken down and that cardiac procedures had to be postponed,"" he said.
""But I accept the trust's explanation that on this occasion it was the size of the equipment was the issue and they were able to source it from the supplier in Germany - and that the protocol on this occasion was not the problem.""
Asked if he would apologise for making the initial claim, Sir Jeffrey said: ""I obviously spoke on the basis of information I had been given from reliable medical sources.
""I accept the information was not entirely accurate and was placed in the public domain by me, and I regret that this happened."" 
Southern Health Trust previously said the parts were sourced from Germany early in August and work was completed by 18 August.
In a statement on Monday, the Southern Health Trust said it had been in contact with Sir Jeffrey ""regarding the recent difficulty with our cardiac catheterisation service between 4 and 21 August 2022"".
""The trust confirmed that the service disruption was in no way connected to the Northern Ireland Protocol and expressed disappointment that Sir Jeffrey appeared to have been misinformed by sources about the issue on this occasion,"" it said. 
Sir Jeffrey had initially told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that patients waiting for life-saving heart surgery in a cardiac unit in a Belfast hospital ""had to wait three weeks because the equipment had to be sourced from another country because we couldn't get it from our own country because of the protocol"".
He later said he stood by his comments and said that the issue arose when people waiting for cardiac surgery in the Southern Trust had to be transferred to the Belfast Trust for treatment due to parts for an angiogram needing to be sourced from Germany.
At the time, the Belfast Health Trust said there was ""no substance"" to Sir Jeffrey's comments.
rotocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.
But it means new checks on goods arriving from Great Britain.
Unionist parties argue that the protocol has undermined Northern Ireland's place within the UK by effectively creating a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
DUP has blocked the restoration of power-sharing in its protest against the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland.
Sir Jeffrey said the protocol still presented ""very real problems"" when it comes to accessing medicines.
Last week a major pharmaceutical firm said there are still unresolved issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol despite changes made by the EU, aimed at guaranteeing the supply of medicines from Great Britain into Northern Ireland."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63700056
business	First pictures of King Charles banknotes revealed	"w look of banknotes featuring the image of King Charles has been unveiled by the Bank of England.
rtrait will be the only change to existing designs of Â£5, Â£10, Â£20 and Â£50 notes and will start to enter circulation from mid-2024.
New notes will feature the King's portrait on the front and in the see-through security window.
Existing notes will still be accepted in shops after the new notes begin to circulate.
Queen Elizabeth was the first and only monarch to consistently appear on circulating Bank of England banknotes, starting in 1960. Notes issued by Scottish and Northern Irish banks do not depict the monarch. 
re are about 4.5 billion individual Bank of England notes worth about Â£80bn in circulation at present.
Bank of England said that, following guidance from the Royal household, the new notes would only be printed to replace worn notes or to meet increased demand, in order to minimise the environmental and financial impact of the change.
Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, said he was ""proud"" of a ""significant moment"" with the new design.
Fifty pence coins bearing the image of King Charles III have already entered circulation via post offices across the country.
An estimated 4.9 million of the new coins are being distributed to post offices - about half of the total number earmarked for circulation - to be given in change to customers.
Coins carrying the image of the late Queen will still be accepted in shops, in the same way as banknotes.
For anyone taking part in a family Christmas quiz this year, it is worth remembering that, in ascending order, the reverse side of current polymer Bank of England banknotes feature Sir Winston Churchill, Jane Austen, JMW Turner and Alan Turing.
Cash use has become far less frequent when compared to debit cards, owing primarily to the use of contactless payments and then accelerated by the Covid pandemic. The buying power of specific coins and banknotes have also been diluted by rising prices.
However, there is still keen interest from consumers and collectors about the images used on cash.
Collectors will be particularly excited to get their hands on the lowest serial numbers of the new King Charles banknotes when they appear."	/news/business-64026683

politics	NI election: No clarity on Stormont plans, say NI politicians	"Northern Ireland secretary has given no clarity over what he intends to do about a potential Stormont election, politicians say.
Chris Heaton-Harris has been holding talks with the parties entitled to executive seats to discuss the ""next steps"" amid the political deadlock.
He has repeatedly said he will call an election, with the deadline for restoring power-sharing having passed.
But on Friday he decided not to set a date for the public to go to the polls.
After last Friday's deadline for reforming a power-sharing executive was missed, an election must be held within 12 weeks.
Sinn FÃ©in wants clarity about a vote, while the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said more talks were ""pointless"".
Mr Heaton-Harris had a 30-minute meeting with Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill on Tuesday morning. 
She said he did not ""colour in the lines"" and that and the public had been ""left in limbo"".
Ms O'Neill said the issue of MLA pay, which has continued despite the lack of a functioning executive, was not mentioned.
Speaking after his meeting with Mr Heaton-Harris DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he was no nearer to knowing if there would be an assembly election.
""The secretary of state has not told us when he is going to call an election,"" he said.
""If an election is called we are ready to fight that election,"" he added.
In a statement issued following the meetings, Mr Heaton-Harris reiterated that he was under a legal obligation to call an election.
He said he listened to the politicians' views on calling that election and said he would provide a further update on the next steps ""in due course"".
""I am particularly worried that the executive has an enormous black hole in its budget, which potentially has serious implications for the delivery of many of Northern Ireland's public services,"" Mr Heaton-Harris added.
""Measures to set a budget will be required in the short term.""
Devolved government in Northern Ireland has not functioned fully since February.
DUP has blocked the restoration of power-sharing in its protest against the post-Brexit trading arrangement known as the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Sir Jeffrey urged the government to have ""a razor-like focus"" on getting a solution to the Protocol issue.
Alliance Party leader said the Northern Ireland secretary was ""clearly taking time"" over what to do next.
Naomi Long said the fact Mr Heaton-Harris had paused was ""a good sign"" but she said a decision over an election ""can't be strung along for weeks"".

If the Northern Ireland Office was hoping a late-night statement on Sunday would bring clarity to the situation, it was wrong.
It said these talks would be about the next steps, including budgets, how to protect public services and considering options on pay for MLAs.
Why would they need to tackle MLAs' pay if there was a possibility Stormont would be back in the short term?
Perhaps a clue that the government acknowledges the institutions are not returning any time soon.
Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader said it is clear the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) ""has no plan"" what to do next.
Doug Beattie said Mr Heaton-Harris intends to call an election but it is not clear when.
In a statement issued on Sunday night, the Northern Ireland secretary said he would ""be outlining to the parties that the people of Northern Ireland deserve a strong and accountable government"".
He added: ""There are a number of things I could do, including taking action on MLA pay, which I know many people feel is deeply unfair while the assembly is unable to function fully. 
""I am also concerned by the issues within the Stormont budget and will address these urgently with my officials and those from the Northern Ireland Civil Service.""
On Monday, Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy accused the DUP of creating a ""political limbo"" for Northern Ireland by ""holding out and preventing us from forming an assembly"".
Gordon Lyons of the DUP said his party would not change its stance until the UK government made changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol.

health	How play makes hospital less traumatic for children	"How play therapy helps children in hospital
Play is how children learn to navigate the world, create relationships, manage their emotions and cope with stressful situations.
re aren't many experiences more stressful than being ill and receiving treatment in hospital yet many do not offer much in the way of play, despite this being a government requirement.
Why is it so important?
Like many six-year-olds, Afonso is focused on building a toy track. Unlike many of his peers, he's trying to construct it in a hospital.  
When he was three, he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a treatable cancer which demands hospital visits for treatments such as chemotherapy as well as lots of blood tests.
""I remember the first period of treatment, which was horrendous,"" his mother, Susana Casanova, recalls.
When he was having his first cannula - a tube which administers treatments - inserted, Susana remembers holding him as he was telling her: ""Mummy, how do you allow them to hurt me so much?"" 
Now, a couple of years and many treatments later, he is not fazed.
""He is not traumatised by the word 'hospital', or doctors or nurses or procedures or lumbar punctures. He's not scared of that,"" Susana says. ""Last year in school, he made a show and tell of going in an ambulance.""
She believes the difference is down to play specialists, experts who entertain Afonso and play with him to support him through his treatments.
""The play is really amazing and it makes children forget they are in the hospital; the playmates put children in their natural environment,"" Susana says.
Julie Morris, one of Afonso's ""playmates"" at Kingston Hospital in south-west London, says it ""involves creating an environment for children that's not clinical"".  
""They (children) often ask for one of us to be with them when they have a scan or a blood test. It makes them feel a little bit more reassured, having somebody there. 
""Sometimes they even look forward to coming in to see us and play in the playroom as well, which is nice.
""We can distract them when they have procedures, we can explain about the procedures - we're with them the whole time."" 
For Afonso's mother, the specialists weren't just there for her son, but her as well.
""Twenty-four hours in hospital, it's too intense,"" she says.
""They've always been super-protective, providing the coffee when I needed, playing with him so I could have a shower to keep going.
""They come and help us in every way they can, making them feel happy and that's the main thing that we want, to see our son happy, and be taken care of.""
One mother, who recently spent more than 20 hours in A&E with her one-year-old, described it as a really tough experience as no play options were available.
""When children go into hospital, they're traumatised, they're afraid, they're anxious, and play is the natural choice for children to feel back in control,"" says Cathy Gilman, chief executive of Starlight Children's Foundation, a charity which provides toys to hospitals.
""It's so important a child isn't lonely or bored in hospital because that's a dangerous place where your mind and your imagination run riot.""
Play specialists can also help children process difficult emotions. 
Children tend to ""puddle jump"" with their feelings - one minute they can be very sad, the next singing and dancing - says play therapist Donna Ellis. 
rd for children, especially if they think their actions are affecting their parents.
""They're very influenced by the mood and the atmosphere around them,"" she says.
""If children start to think they can't talk about things or notice that it's upsetting adults, they can then learn they've got to adapt their own behaviours.
""As adults, we're quite guilty of persuading children out of feeling states. When they're upset, we'll say 'oh, cheer up, never mind' or 'it's OK'.
""Feelings come and go. If you talk with children about feelings being like waves, and the wave comes, it feels a bit bumpy or a bit scary or a bit rocky, but the seas move over.""
One of the benefits of having a play specialist or therapist on hand is that they do not have the same emotional investment in a child as the parents.
""Although I am emotionally connected to them, they're not my children, so we can have difficult conversations, children can say things to me,"" adds Ms Ellis.
It's a service not available to every child.
According to the National Association of Healthcare Specialists, 80% of hospitals say their play services are limited.
Many have not recovered the service they offered before the pandemic when play areas were closed for infection control and play specialists were redeployed. 
But even before the pandemic, access to play support was far from universal, according to Ms Gilman, who says 80% of hospitals that use Starlight's services have no budget for play and, of those that do, it's less than Â£500 a year. 
In 2004, the government's national framework for children, young people and maternity services set out a requirement for play services to be available in all hospital settings, citing research that showed play ""hastened recovery, as well as reduced the need for interventions to be delivered under general anaesthesia"".
In a statement, the NHS said it recognised the importance of children's play services and was working closely with the Starlight Children's Foundation on increasing their availability.
""We have introduced a new taskforce and will be creating guidance for local areas to help them increase access and improve the quality of these services across hospitals in England, in line with NICE guidance,"" it added.
One service Starlight offers is boxes containing toys and other things for children to play with. Each one costs about Â£100 and can support 60 children. 
rity is also running a Christmas appeal, called Play Loneliness Away, to raise Â£400,000 to make sure children have access to toys and technology such as computer consoles.
Although NHS budgets are stretched, play can help make treatments go more smoothly which helps nurses and saves money in the long run, Ms Gilman says.
""If a child is less distressed then they can be treated more easily. So that preparation before with play, distraction during treatment and when you're bored afterwards is really important.""
Claire Russell, early years expert and founder of PlayHOORAY!
Play can offer an amazing insight into how your child thinks and feels. When a child is processing complex emotional issues, it can very often show up in their play. 
For example, if a child hears adults arguing, they may recreate this conflict with their teddies. 
Make-believe play can help prepare children for the unknown and ease worry and anxiety in the process.
As children get older their play changes so then it is about finding new ways to ""play"". 
Dancing or singing loudly can be seen as play too. Research shows these activities will get the endorphins going, which can actually reduce stress levels and be a factor in warding off anxiety and depression. 
It's important that people know that they don't need to spend money on toys or equipment to entertain a child - I promise you can have just as much fun with everyday items around the house. 
Spending time with your child and being silly with them, whatever their age, will remind them they are valued and loved, and laughing together is a wonderful medicine.

In 2019, the Grammy Award winning rapper Coolio, who has died at the age of 59, played an intimate gig to about 100 people in Castlederg, County Tyrone.
Even the organiser was surprised.
As Dave Doherty from The Townhouse explained, the show happened after a larger tour date fell through and he was asked if he knew anywhere Coolio could play.
""Because we're involved in Dergfest we were talking to one of the promoters about trying to get an act for the festival and he just made an off-the-cuff remark,"" Mr Doherty told BBC Radio Foyle's News At One programme.
""I said 'this is just mad enough to work', so I said 'look he can come and play in my place, it's a bit off the beaten track'.""
rest was history.
As Mr Doherty explained, Coolio, whose real name was Artis Leon Ivey Jr, searched for Castlederg online and said he would do it.
Famed for his 1995 track Gangsta's Paradise, the star's death was announced on Thursday, prompting tributes from the music industry and beyond.
""He came with his six-piece band, a brass section and a soprano singer along with him from Croatia,"" Mr Doherty said.
""They put on one hell of a show.""
usinessman said he did not believe the gig was real until a contract was signed - but then came the rider demands.
Expensive tequila, premium vodka, top of the range champagne and food platters.
""I thought we'd bitten off more than we could chew here,"" Mr Doherty joked.
However, the rapper made a lasting impression, particularly with the owner's son, Alex, who aged 12 was a fan of hip-hop and rap music.
Coolio spent 20 minutes talking about music with him and gifted him a signed shirt.
His party even stayed on at the venue into the early hours and ""talked to everybody"".
Coolio, who was born in Pennsylvania, was found dead at a friend's house in Los Angeles, his management announced.
He was also known for appearances on Big Brother and a reality cook-off series.
""He was a really nice guy and a really nice human being,"" Mr Doherty reflected when asked for his own tribute to the music star. 
""The time that he took to spend with my son, to talk music and to talk to everybody, there was no ego or anything from him, he was just really down to earth for somebody that's a Grammy Award winner landing in Castlederg."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63073449
technology	Billions being spent in metaverse land grab	"Nearly $2bn (Â£1.75bn) has been spent on virtual land in the past 12 months, as people and companies race to get a foothold in the metaverse, research shows. 
But we are years away from the metaverse emerging as a single immersive space online where people can live, work and play in virtual reality. So is the land grab one big gamble?
With her giant dark red mohican and permanent cigarette, artist Angie Taylor's avatar does not look like a typical land mogul. But she is one of a growing breed of people staking a claim to new virtual worlds.
""I bought my first metaverse parcel in July 2020 and paid about Â£1,500. I bought it for exhibiting my own work, but also for running metaverse events that would promote my art and also other people's art,"" she says.
Angie, from Brighton, built two galleries full of strange and beautiful digital artwork, which is being sold in cryptocurrency, on her land in the Voxels world.
Angie's plots are about the size of a small family house (if you compare them to the size of her avatar). The tallest stretches up over three floors and has a roof terrace with a white-and-black-striped road crossing, and a pink taxi permanently driving back and forth just for fun.
But you get a real sense of the scale of this world from the air.
""Hold down the F key and you can fly up to take a look at my neighbourhood,"" Angie explains. Above her gallery you can see thousands of identical boxes of land stretching to the horizon.
Voxels is one of dozens of virtual worlds that describe themselves as metaverses. It is confusing, because people often talk about ""the metaverse"" as if there was only one. But until one platform starts to dominate, or these disparate worlds join together, companies are selling land and experiences in their own versions.
Researchers at metaverse analysts DappRadar say that $1.93bn worth of cryptocurrency has been spent buying virtual land in the past year alone, with $22m of that spent on about 3,000 parcels of land in Voxels. 
DappRadar can monitor this because Voxels is built on the Ethereum cryptocurrency system, in which, like all virtual currencies, every transaction is logged and published on a public blockchain.
One of the most popular worlds is the cartoony Decentraland. Launched in 2020, parcels of land there are selling for thousands, sometimes millions of dollars. Samsung, UPS and Sotheby's are among those who have bought land and built shops and visitor centres there. 
Luxury fashion brand Philipp Plein also owns a plot about the size of four football pitches, which it hopes will eventually contain a metaverse store and gallery.
However, owner Mr Plein says his mum is not convinced by his $1.5m purchase.
""My mother called me and said, 'what did you do? Why? Are you crazy, why do you spend so much money, what is this?',"" he says.
Mr Plein has been selling goods in 24 different cryptocurrencies online for more than a year. Earlier in 2022, he opened a new shop on London's Old Bond Street selling clothing and some non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in exchange for cryptocoins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as pounds.
He says opening the shop helped him learn more about the metaverse and adds: ""I made a bold step spending so much on a piece of land.
""But I was thinking that I've had over 24 years with my brand and what would I have to do if I was starting again?""
However, with the general collapse in the value of cryptocurrencies, Dapp Radar says metaverse real estate values are near a one-year low
In Sandbox, another of the crypto metaverses, Adidas, Atari, Ubisoft, Binance, Warner Music and Gucci are just some of the multinationals buying land, and building experiences to sell and promote their products and services.
Gucci has also built in Roblox, which alongside other big gaming platforms like Minecraft and Fortnite, is seen as the most mainstream of the fledgling metaverses.
gaming corporations do not sell land and are run without the use of any blockchain technology. However, they already have some of the key ingredients that sci-fi writers say we need for a true metaverse:
Gucci Town has had more than 36 million visits in the year since it was launched, while Nike Land has recorded more than 25 million in 11 months. In Gucci Town, players can buy clothing for their avatars with real money. In Nike Land they can obtain T-shirts and shoes for avatars with points earned by playing games.
Fashion seems to be the industry most keen to take the opportunities and risks associated with the metaverse.
Digital-only fashion house The Fabricant, based in Amsterdam, only makes clothing for avatars, designing collections and bespoke garments for users of Decentraland, Sandbox and other crypto metaverses. 
Amber Jae Slooten predicts there will be a ""mass market"" for digital clothes
""When we started, everybody called us crazy, because they were like, 'why would you need this?'. But we very strongly believed in the idea that in the future, people would wear the digital items,"" says co-founder and lead designer Amber Jae Slooten.
Fabricant's record sale so far is a digital dress which fetched $19,000, though it was sold as an NFT - a digital art piece - and has not been worn by the owner's avatar.
mpany just raised $14m in funding from investors betting on the idea that many of us will soon be living part of our lives in the metaverse.
But it is not certain if and when that will happen. The crypto metaverses are generally sparsely populated and only really used when events are held, and even then only thousands, and not millions, of people attend.
Even in the virtual world in which Meta, owners of Facebook and Instagram, is investing billions of dollars, leaked memos show people are not staying for long.
But Ms Slooten is convinced that as these worlds develop, people will come.
""There will be for sure a mass market in this because if you think about the younger generation, they already play games. For them there's no distinction between virtual and real. But it still needs to be built.""  "	/news/technology-63488059
health	What is strep A and what are the symptoms?	"Health officials say parents should be aware of an infection called strep A, after children in the UK died from it.
Since Covid restrictions eased, there are more opportunities for infections like this to spread. Cases have been increasing in recent weeks.
While most people do not get extremely sick, the highly contagious bacterium that causes the infection can cause serious illness and complications. 
It's sometimes found in the throat or on the skin. 
Many people carry it harmlessly without even knowing, but they can spread it to others who might become ill. 
People can catch it through close contact and from coughs and sneezes. 
Outbreaks can sometimes happen in places like schools and care homes.
Most often, symptoms are mild - a sore throat or a skin infection that can be easily treated with antibiotics. 
But strep A can cause a range of things - and some of them are more serious. 
One is scarlet fever, which mostly affects young children and, again, needs antibiotics. 
It is a notifiable disease, meaning health professionals must inform local health protection teams of suspected cases. This is so they can be treated quickly and possible outbreaks brought under control.
It causes a rash and flu-like symptoms, including a temperature, sore throat and swollen neck glands. 
On darker skin the rash can be more difficult to detect visually but will have a sandpapery feel. 
Someone who has scarlet fever may have what doctors call a strawberry tongue - because its appearance looks a bit like a strawberry.
Very rarely, strep A can also cause something called invasive group A streptococcal infection or iGAS. 
. 
Invasive disease happens when the bacteria get past your body's immune defences. This can happen when you are already ill or are on treatments, such as some cancer therapies, that affect your immune system.
Warning signs of invasive disease include:
Urgent, early medical help is essential.
UK Health Security Agency advises: ""Anyone with high fever, severe muscle aches, pain in one area of the body and unexplained vomiting or diarrhoea should call NHS 111 and seek medical help immediately.""
If you think your child may have any symptoms from strep A then you should speak with your doctor. 
m if you have been in contact with someone who has had strep A recently.
rust your judgement if your child seems seriously unwell.
Contact NHS 111 or your local surgery if they:
Call 999 or go to an accident-and-emergency unit if:
Yes. Anyone can catch it if they come into close contact with someone who is infected. Most people will not get very sick though. 
No. Strep A is treated with antibiotics. 
Doctors usually diagnose and treat strep A infections based on a person's symptoms, rather than test results, but they may take a throat swab. In the UK, rapid turnaround swab tests are not used by the NHS. Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, told the BBC: ""We are not advising using those at the moment. It's very much a clinical diagnosis.""
For example, someone who tests positive for strep throat but has no symptoms may not need antibiotics. They are less likely to spread it to others than someone with symptoms, and they very unlikely to get complications.
People with strep throat should stay home from work, school, or nursery until they no longer have a fever and have taken antibiotics for at least 24 hours. This will help stop the infection spreading to other people.
Investigations are under way following reports of an increase in infections in children over the past few weeks, particularly with some causing severe illness.
Currently, there is no evidence that a new strain is circulating. The increase is most likely related to high amounts of circulating bacteria.

entertainment	Slaves: British punk band change name to Soft Play after criticism	"British punk band Slaves have changed their name, saying it ""doesn't represent who we are as people or what our music stands for any longer"".
uo, who have had three UK top 10 albums and a Mercury Prize nomination, will now be known as Soft Play.
r original name ""was intended solely as a reference to the grind of day-to-day life"".
A statement added: ""We want to sincerely apologise to anyone we've offended.""
me caused controversy when the group made their breakthrough in 2014/15, with The Fader publishing an article headlined: ""Why Would A Band Of White Dudes Name Themselves Slaves?""
Kent band defended their choice at the time, posting a statement explaining that they had been ""working tedious 9-5 jobs when we started playing together, stacking shelves and mopping floors"".
: ""Our name and music is aimed at being a slave to day-to-day life and routine. It is a metaphorical use of the word...
""Cease Fire and Wishing Well are the first two tracks we ever wrote, they address people addicted to smoking and the struggle of the day-to-day rat race: 'It doesn't matter if they're taken because they'll take you'.""
Now, they are returning after a three-year break and have put out a new statement saying: ""As younger men, we responded to criticism of the name from a place of fear and defensiveness.
""Feeling backed into a corner, our own pride caused us to fight for a name we weren't even sure we wanted any more. It felt at times as if our band name had defined us and we were scared of what might happen if we changed it.
""However, we now recognise that our original intent doesn't change the fact that the name Slaves is an issue. In this day and age we believe it is very important that people change and make improvements no matter how far down the line they are."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63916733
politics	COP27: Inside one of UK's oldest green power stations	"Hidden away in a remote valley you'll find one of the UK's oldest renewable power stations.
For 60 years, Rheidol Hydropower Plant, near Aberystwyth, has been generating clean electricity from abundant rain.
Operators say Wales has the key ingredients to be a ""strong player"" in producing green energy, but the Institute of Welsh Affairs has warned progress has been too slow.
Welsh government said it had bold ambitions to meet energy needs.
It is set to talk later about its plans to tackle climate change, while world leaders are meeting in Egypt for the COP27 summit.
Renewable sources like wind, solar and hydro meet 56% of Wales' electricity demand, but the Welsh government hopes this will reach 70% by 2030, although this is currently under review.
People are ""always surprised"" when they stumble across the vast hydro power plant in Ceredigion's scenic Cwm Rheidol valley, according to boss Dennis Geyermann.
""But this is the story of renewable energy - it brings interesting, high tech jobs into rural areas,"" he said.
Made up of a series of interconnecting reservoirs, dams, underground tunnels and power stations, it is the largest project of its kind in Wales and England.
It covers a total area of 62 sq miles (162 sq km), and supplies enough electricity to power up to 15,000 homes. 
Since 2008, it has been owned by Statkraft, an offshoot of the Norwegian government, and Europe's largest producer of renewable power.
From here the firm's other renewable energy schemes - as far afield as the Scottish Highlands - are also monitored 24 hours a day.
""This is kind of like the brains of the operation,"" explained Mr Geyermann, vice president for operations and maintenance.
He said the company - which recently announced it hopes to develop a new green hydrogen plant in Pembrokeshire - had a ""large project pipeline for the UK"". 
And Wales, in particular, could be ""a strong player when it comes to renewable energy"", he added.
""We have the right landscape, we have enough rain and wind and there's a great coastline,"" he said.
""The Welsh people are up for it too.""
Sarah South, who is responsible for health and safety at Statkraft UK, grew up nearby and recalled fishing with her father in the scheme's reservoirs, as well as countless school trips to the site.
She said she would encourage young people to gain the skills needed to take advantage of the ""big push"" towards green energy.
""Your English, sciences, maths, geography - you might think they're boring subjects in school - but they'll be really important,"" she said.
""It's such a big industry that's coming through now, and so important to the future of the world.""
Built in 1962, long before concern about climate change filled the headlines, Rheidol's hydropower scheme has lived through an energy revolution in the UK.
At the time, virtually all our power came from burning coal.
Fast forward to 2020 and, for the first time in more than 200 years, the official energy statistics showed coal had played no part in Wales' energy generation mix.
And 56% of the country's electricity demand is now met from renewable sources like wind, solar and hydro.
Officially, the Welsh government's target is to reach 70% by 2030, though that is currently under review.
Auriol Miller, director of the Institute of Welsh Affairs think-thank, said progress had, so far, been too slow.
""We've got to look higher, further and faster in terms of those targets,"" she argued.
k-tank has urged Welsh ministers to aim for 100% by 2035 in a series of reports in recent years.
Scotland, by comparison, is virtually already there. 
Neil Lewis, founder of Carmarthenshire Energy which has helped develop wind, solar and electric vehicle projects across the county, said it took too long to get schemes off the drawing board.
""We have colleagues who've built community-owned windfarms which have taken 10 to 20 years to get permission to build them,"" he said.
""It's really important that we speed up our efforts.""
Meanwhile, the Senedd's climate change committee has also expressed concern over a slowdown in renewable energy development since 2015.
Welsh government, which this year carried out what it described as a deep dive investigation into the barriers facing renewable energy, has pledged new targets by next summer and a national energy plan by 2024.
It also announced earlier this month that it was setting up a state-owned renewable energy developer for Wales - in a UK first.
In a statement, the Welsh government said it had ""bold ambitions for renewable generation to at least fully meet our energy needs in Wales - while receiving a fair share of its wealth and value"".
It said it was ""making progress towards our targets but we need to go further and faster"". 
""We are supporting local organisations to tackle climate change and we will support businesses to develop their staff for the clean energy future,"" it added.
""In this cost of living crisis, we must focus on finding the most affordable, least impactful solution as the decisions we make today will have a massive impact on generations to come."""	/news/uk-wales-63520919
entertainment	Royal Opera House bans audience member for heckling child actor	"Royal Opera House has banned an audience member for life for booing and heckling a 12-year-old actor during a production of Handel's opera Alcina.
Malakai M Bayoh was met with cries of ""Rubbish!"" while singing his lines, on Tuesday, opening night, in London.
Onlookers shushed the heckler, who left soon after, and loudly applauded Bayoh.
ROH said it was ""appalled"" at the outburst and praised the classically trained youngster for his well reviewed portrayal of Oberto. 
In a statement shared with BBC News, a spokesman said: ""Malakai is astonishingly talented, bringing great acting and beautiful singing to the role - a huge accomplishment for such a young singer.
""Unfortunately, the opening night of Alcina featured an audience member who disrupted the show and Malakai's excellent performance.
""We are appalled that a member of the audience behaved in this way and our support is with Malakai and the cast and creative team of Alcina.
""Steps have been taken to ensure the audience member in question does not return to the Royal Opera House.""
Financial Times associate arts editor Josh Spero broke the news, tweeting the ""nastiest thing happened"" at the production.
""A 12-year-old boy was sweetly singing his lines when a man in the audience yelled, 'Rubbish!' and booed him,"" he wrote. 
""Who would do that to a child?
""Once the boy was done, the audience responded with wild applause and cheering.""
Rebecca Franks, of the Times, reported ""vile behaviour from one audience member at Alcina at the Royal Opera House"".
""He booed and heckled the young boy singing (in a lovely way) Oberto,"" she posted.
""Thankfully, the rest of the audience drowned the heckler out with extra-loud, heartfelt applause. But, seriously, who boos a child?""
Others soon shared this disdain online, with one tweeting: ""Paying for a ticket doesn't give people the right to act however they want.""
Bayoh, who trained at the Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School, features alongside Lisette Oropesa, Emily D'Angelo, Mary Bevan, Varduhi Abrahamyan and Rupert Charlesworth in Richard Jones's production of Handel's fantastical 1735 opera seria.
He was praised by critics for his excellent performance under difficult circumstances.
In a four-star review for the Guardian, Martin Kettle wrote: ""Jones's dramatically poignant choice of a child alto (here a reedy Malakhai Bayoh) to sing the lost boy Oberto caused barracking from one single person that was quickly - and rightly - drowned in cheers from everyone else.""
graph's Nicholas Kenyon also gave four stars, referring to a ""shameful heckle"" while noting Bayoh ""received a huge ovation"".
""The evil spirit of Handel's enchantress Alcina evidently infected one audience member at Tuesday's premiere of this new production,"" he wrote. 
""The young Malakai M Bayoh, making his debut in the role of the boy Oberto, was shamefully heckled in the middle of an aria that he was singing skilfully and exuberantly."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63566862
business	Stansted Airport accepts council's Â£2.1m legal costs offer	"London Stansted Airport has accepted a council's ""all in"" offer of Â£2.1m to cover its legal costs following a High Court battle over expansion.

But this was rejected by the Essex airport in June. 
Earlier this month, the council voted to make two new offers of Â£2.05m, including Â£50,000 interest, and a second ""all in"" offer of Â£2.1m.
According to a council report published ahead of that meeting, Â£1m had already been paid to the airport in June, and this was included in the Â£2.1m figure.
was expected to wipe out the council's strategic initiative fund, which had a balance of Â£1.65m before the Â£1m was paid.
report said the medium term financial strategy will be used to cover the remaining Â£437,000.
In a statement, the airport said: ""We can confirm we have accepted UDC's offer in relation to our planning appeal costs, which it was ordered to pay by the Planning Inspectorate.""
At a meeting earlier this month, councillors from local authority's ruling Residents for Uttlesford (RfU) party said the airport had asked for a far larger figure, but that this had been negotiated down.
Stansted Airport said ""we welcome this positive step forward"" by the council.
ffer, which included Â£50,000 in interest, was voted through by councillors, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
RfU previously said the group hoped the offer would bring an end to the saga for the council.
Opposition councillors had criticised the administration over the legal case.

technology	Is Finland's Wood City the future of building?	"It smells like a lush pine forest in the lunch room of a new upper secondary school in Helsinki, but there's no scented air freshener.
Instead, most of the five-storey building has been constructed out of wood.
won't be completed until next year, although smooth wooden panels already line many of the interior walls. Wood has also been used in load-bearing structures, to support the ceilings between the floors, and as cladding on the exterior.
""It's a more sustainable choice,"" says Miimu Airaksinen, an engineer and vice president of development at SRV, the Finnish construction company behind the school. 
""But we're also working with wood because wood is a nice material, people appreciate and like wood and the design of wood.""
roject is part of a growing trend in the Finnish building industry. Developers are increasingly swapping out more mainstream materials like concrete and steel, in favour of wood. It's linked to the country's ambitious efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035 and become Europe's leading circular economy.
With three-quarters of land in Finland covered by forests, wood is a readily available material here, although it does need to be strengthened for use in mid-rise and tall buildings.
In Finland, where detached wooden villas and summer cottages are common, there is less public concern about fires than there might be in parts of the world that are less used to using wood as a construction material. 
Nevertheless, SRV still faces questions about flammability, especially in taller buildings. There is plenty of evidence that engineered wood called CLT (cross-laminated timber) performs well in fires though, says Ms Airaksinen, since it is designed to withstand high heat levels and can be slower to collapse compared to concrete.
At the upper school construction site, her team is busy slicing up slabs of CLT which is produced by bonding together layers of wooden panels at right angles. ""You're making the wood stiffer, so that makes the wood much stronger,"" she explains.
Engineered wood like CLT has a range of environmental benefits, including being much lighter than many building materials, so less heavy machinery and energy is needed during construction. Buildings can also be quicker to complete since there is no drying phase as there is with concrete. 
Plus, wooden buildings actually remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they emit; they can hold in carbon that is absorbed from the atmosphere by trees for five to six decades. By contrast, steel and concrete leave massive carbon footprints.
""It can really help us with climate change,"" says Ali Amiri, a sustainable buildings researcher at Aalto University near Helsinki, and a former civil engineer.
""If we go through the comparison with wooden buildings and other buildings like concrete or steel or even brick buildings, [wood has] something like 20 to even 30% lower greenhouse gas emissions. So this is very good news.""
According to his team's research, if 80% of new residential buildings in Europe were made of wood they could store up to 55 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. That is equivalent to almost half the yearly emissions made by the continent's cement industry.
Engineered woods like CLT have been used in Europe since the 1990s, but they have had a resurgence in Finland thanks to a government-backed wood-building programme designed to ensure 45% of public buildings use wood as a key material by 2025. Developers can apply for grants and get help with tasks such as procurement and risk communication. ""I think every company [here] is doing wooden buildings today,"" says Ms Airaksinen. ""The pressure is on for sustainability.""
At the upper secondary school, gypsum board, which is made from limestone and not flammable, is used to add an extra layer of protection on the interior walls on higher floors. ""We need to take fire safety seriously,"" says Ms Airaksinen. ""We also did a lot of simulation about evacuation and durability in case there will be a fire."" 
wooden trend is catching on in the private sector too. Data from the Federation of the Finnish Woodworking Industries suggests it is already a key material in 4% of apartments and 16% of commercial buildings. 
In Helsinki city centre there's even a new neighbourhood, Wood City, with hundreds of new wooden flats.
It is also home to the headquarters of Finnish gaming giant Supercell, where huge carved wooden characters and dramatic curved panels make for an impactful reception area, and wood lines the walls of eight storeys of open-plan office space, cafes and even nap rooms.
Cybersecurity company WithSecure is in the process of building a new office next door, in collaboration with SRV and Stora Enso, a major Finnish producer of engineered wood.
And, perhaps least surprisingly, in a country where people famously love getting sweaty, one of Helsinki's most popular leisure attractions is a giant wooden sauna and restaurant complex. Opened in 2016, the LÃ¶yly complex has won multiple global awards for its striking wooden cloak-like structure, which allows visitors to climb up its sloping roof.
Environmental campaign groups such as WWF have raised concerns that increasing the construction of wooden buildings could put too much pressure on the planet's forests. 
""From a climate perspective it is a good way to store carbon, but on the other hand we are increasing the overall level of consumption of natural resources,"" says Mai Suominen, a leading forest expert for WWF. ""Because obviously we do need other wood-based products as well, such as paper or packing material, [and] if we plan to increase other production, we are increasing the level of cutting.""
Finland's wood production companies have committed to replanting logged areas in a sensitive and sustainable way. However, Ms Suominen argues that there is still a risk of lower biodiversity if production ramps up in future, which could have an impact on both animals and humans.
""Then the forest processes, at some point they collapse and they are not as flexible to responding to changing environmental conditions caused by climate change. We will face more rainfall, more drought and insect outbreaks.""
Sustainability expert Nani Pajunen from the Finnish Innovation Fund, Sitra, agrees it is important that construction firms in Finland and beyond don't simply jump on the bandwagon of the wooden buildings trend in an effort to appear greener. 
She argues it is more important that businesses make broad assessments of the carbon footprint of their production processes, and the different life cycle potentials of materials.
For example, other recent innovations designed to improve sustainability in the sector, such as recyclable concrete and steel, might be more durable than wood in large-scale projects such as very tall apartment blocks, public venues or bridges. 
""It's not a black and white question of which [materials] are wrong and right,"" she argues. ""It's about the attitude. You have to think, if you are an engineer in the construction sector, how to use materials in a more sustainable way.""
Despite the environmental concerns, the wooden buildings sector is growing, with other Nordic countries, Germany, Canada and the US in particular ramping up their production in the last couple of years.
More technology of business:
Market research company Fortune Business Insights recently valued the CLT market at $806m (Â£715m) and predicted growth of 14% by 2028. 
In the wake of the Ukraine war pushing up the global cost of steel and energy, Mr Amiri says his research team has also noticed a spike in enquiries from businesses and decision-makers from around the world. 
While Mr Amiri predicts wooden building construction will ""definitely increase"" in Europe and North America in the coming years, he points out that building with engineered wood for multi-storey projects is still ""a bit more expensive"" than using more common materials. This, he argues, might make it harder to persuade countries with access to cheap concrete and steel to switch direction. 
Back amongst the forklift trucks and diggers continuing to transform SRV's school construction site, Ms Airaksinen says she envisages the wooden building sector increasing in tandem with the development of new low-carbon materials. 
""We are focusing on building sustainable buildings and lifecycle wise buildings,"" she says. ""That's the future."""	/news/business-62798950

Department for International Trade said the work was part of a wider push by the UK to use trade to ""drive prosperity and help eradicate poverty"", as well as reduce dependency on aid. 
me includes powers to suspend a country on the grounds of human rights or labour violations, as well as for not meeting their climate change obligations. 
International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: ""As an independent trading nation, we are taking back control of our trade policy and making decisions that back UK businesses, help with the cost of living, and support the economies of developing countries around the world.
""UK businesses can look forward to less red-tape and lower costs, incentivising firms to import goods from developing countries.""
Many goods, from textiles to fruit, in 65 of the world's poorest nations already benefit from reduced or zero tariffs when sold to the UK, making them more appealing. 
w scheme cuts some of those charges further - for example, on cucumbers which can not be produced here during the winter. 
It also simplifies the rules for which items, such as some textiles, qualify for preferential treatment. 
ges could save importers millions of pounds - although, even if passed on in full, the price savings for consumers may be marginal. 
Coming when aid to developing countries has been reduced, the scheme underlines a government policy of using trade instead. 
me removes some seasonal tariffs on products like cucumbers, which cannot be grown in the UK in the winter, so they are tariff-free during this period for the majority of countries under the scheme. 
It also simplifies trade rules such as rules of origin, which dictate what proportion of a product must be made in its country of origin. 
Mohammed Jabbar, managing director of DBL Group, a textile business from Bangladesh, said this was a ""game changer"" for his company. 
""[The changes] mean we will be able to source our cotton from many more countries than we could before, which will make the business more competitive and our supply chains a lot more resilient,"" he said. "	/news/business-62557128

health	Nurses' strike: Services affected as staff stage second walkout	"Hundreds of hospital appointments have been cancelled as Northern Ireland's nurses stage a second day of strike action. 
Last week, they joined colleagues in England and Wales in the first day of the planned two-day industrial action.
Emergency care is continuing but other services have been impacted. 
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has warned of further strikes in the new year, which the Department of Health say would be ""catastrophic"". 
12-hour strike, from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT, marks the third time in three years that Northern Ireland's nurses have been on strike over fair pay and staffing issues.
RCN, a union representing about 500,000 nurses across the UK, has said its members are 20% worse off in terms of pay since 2010.
It has called for a pay rise of 5% above retail price index (RPI) inflation.
government has said this is unaffordable and has not made an offer close to this amount.
A rise of 5% over RPI inflation would currently amount to a pay increase of 19%.
However, Rita Devlin, the RCN's director in Northern Ireland, said nurses had not made that demand and the figure should be set in context.
""We asked for 5% which is a restorative pay rise, because we've lost 20% in the last 10 years,"" she said. 
She explained on top of this, they were asking for an additional pay rise that would match the rate of inflation.
""When we asked for inflation, it was at 6%.  We never asked for 19%, despite what the government keeps telling you,"" Ms Devlin added.
She said the RCN was prepared to negotiate and called for UK Health Secretary Steve Barclay to enter more talks with unions over pay.
""We are asking for the health minister to get in to a room with nurses and have a discussion. If 19% isn't affordable, what is?""
Northern Ireland's nurses say they will not be held to ransom
union said it will set the government a 48-hour deadline after strike action ends to discuss pay.
If it is not resolved, the RCN said it will announce more strike action for the new year.
Northern Ireland's most senior civil servant in the health service, Peter May, warned more strikes next year could have ""catastrophic consequences"".
In a letter to Steve Barclay, he said: ""We are facing a winter of unprecedented challenges. 
""I am advised by Prof Sir Michael McBride, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer, that influenza and Covid infections may increase during this period, adding further to the difficulties.
""Against that backdrop, another series of health service strikes in the new year could have catastrophic consequences. 
""The ability of NI's health care system to provide safe patient care - already under severe stain - may be further undermined.""
When a permanent health secretary takes to writing public letters it feels like a last ditch attempt to put off the inevitable.
While some may describe his choice of words as harsh others will see it as a dose of reality. 
ruth is that the system is broken and many workers feel abandoned. 
Having no health minister nor executive means that many feel there is little hope of resolving the latest crisis. 
What should feel like the most wonderful time of the year - doesn't.  
rvice is on its knees and as I write nurses are on the picket line. 
If Peter May is hoping his letter will stop unions striking and start pay negotiation talks he really is hoping for a Christmas miracle. 
RCN said there are about 3,000 nursing vacancies in Northern Ireland.
Andrew Doherty, the RCN's representative and trade union secretary for the Western Trust, said many members he had spoken with believed this was ""as bad as everybody has known it within the health service"".
""We have high numbers of vacancies...that means for every team there is at least one nurse missing and then combine that with absence or sickness figures and we have teams that are really, really short on staff,""  he told BBC Radio Foyle.
""That means patient care is unfortunately being undone.""
walkouts have affected hundreds of patients across Northern Ireland.
In the Belfast Health Trust, 175 new outpatient appointments, 289 outpatient reviews and 26 inpatient day cases were cancelled.
South Eastern Trust said 17 endoscopy investigations were postponed, 15 surgical procedures cancelled, 229 outpatient appointments cancelled and the minor injuries unit at Ards Hospital closed. 
Southern Trust said 204 outpatients appoints were cancelled, 28 day cases and nine inpatient appointments were cancelled, while 448 appointments would not go ahead within the older people and primary care division. The minor injuries service at South Tyrone Hospital was closed.
In the Western Trust some 515 outpatient appointments were postponed and 37 planned inpatient and day case procedures were cancelled. 
In the Northern Trust 154 outpatient appointments were affected.
Denise Kelly is a  clinical nurse at Antrim Area Hospital and said staffing shortages were affecting staff and patients every day.
""Nurses are going home demoralised, destabilised; they have a moral injury because they feel they are not able to give the care those patients deserve,"" she said.
Scottish nurses who are not on strike joined their colleagues in Northern Ireland in a show of solidarity this morning.
At the Royal Victoria Hospital Belfast, nurses have also gathered at the picket line with some joining the strike action after a night shift.
Christopher Boyle, who is a senior cardiac nurse at the hospital, said the strikes are about more just staff pay.
He said: ""It's about protecting the NHS, protecting people. This is not about us being greedy and I am sure the public understand that."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64030422

politics	Conservative Gareth Davies apologises for storming out of Senedd	"Watch the moment Gareth Davies storms out of the Welsh Parliament chamber
A politician has apologised after he stormed out of the Welsh Parliament's chamber.
Conservative Vale of Clwyd Member of the Senedd (MS) Gareth Davies left during health questions after slamming his file on his desk.
Llywydd (presiding officer) Elin Jones said she would not call him to speak again until he had apologised.
One Labour MS was said to have moved seats because she felt threatened by his outburst.
Welsh Conservatives later said Mr Davies had apologised to both the Llywydd and the Labour MS involved.
Mr Davies had been asking Health Minister Eluned Morgan about plans to build a community hospital in his Vale of Clwyd constituency.
He said people had been ""promised this for a decade without a spade going in the ground or any tangible evidence that this Welsh government is doing anything"".
But Ms Morgan asked why she was answering questions from the Conservatives' spokesman on care, rather than health. 
Llywydd said political parties could decide who asks questions on their behalf.
Shortly after, Mr Davies threw a file stand to the floor, and his file to his desk, and could be heard saying ""grow up"" and ""I'm tired of this"". 
Llywydd said the minister did not need to answer his final question ""because things have got out of order"".
She asked Mr Davies to leave quietly, at which point he walked out saying: ""I will leave. It's an affront to democracy.""
Later, Labour MS Joyce Watson said one of her colleagues felt so threatened she had to move.
""I've never ever experienced behaviour like that in this chamber,"" she said.
Labour North Wales MS Carolyn Thomas was seen to move away from her seat near Mr Davies.
Llywydd said it was an ""unacceptable outburst by the member"" which ""shook us all at the time, not only those in close proximity"".
She added: ""I will expect an apology from Gareth Davies before he is called again in this chamber.
""That apology will be to me but it will be for all of us.
""Our expectations are high in this place and one member failed to reach that expectation of behaviour this afternoon.""
A Welsh Conservative Senedd spokesman said: ""Gareth has apologised to the chair and to Carolyn. He makes no apologies for raising legitimate questions with Labour ministers.
""The member was reflecting the frustration felt by many people in Wales about Labour's management of our health service."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63654594
business	Bitcoin value drops by 50% since November peak	"ue of Bitcoin has dropped below $31,000 (Â£25,140) - less than half of what it was at its peak last November, according to the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange.
fall of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value comes as stock markets around the world have also tumbled in recent days.
On Monday, key European, Asian and US indexes slid lower again.
Investors are fleeing riskier assets for safe havens like the dollar.
On Monday, Japan's Nikkei index dropped 2.5%, while London's FTSE 100 closed down more than 2%. In the US, the Dow fell nearly 2%, the S&P 500 dropped 3.2% and Nasdaq lost 4.3%, deepening the falls in recent weeks.
Uber was among the companies driving the declines.
Shares in the company dropped more than 11% on Monday after media outlets reported that chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi had warned staff that investors were becoming more cautious about investments. He said Uber would respond by cutting costs and slowing its hiring.
""It's clear that the market is experiencing a seismic shift and we need to react accordingly,"" he wrote in the letter.
""The average employee at Uber is barely over 30, which means you've spent your career in a long and unprecedented bull run. This next period will be different, and it will require a different approach.""
In times of market uncertainty traditional investors will often sell what they see as riskier assets - like digital currency - and move their money into safer investments.
Moves in cryptocurrency markets have increasingly followed wider trends, as professional investors, such as hedge funds and money managers, become more active in trading what was once the domain of individual investors and enthusiasts.
Bitcoin, which accounts for about a third of the cryptocurrency market with a total value of close to $570bn, has seen its price plunge more than 10% in the last day and more than 20% in the last week.
Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency in the world, has also fallen in value, down by more than 20% in the last week.
Volatile trading in digital assets has not been unusual in previous years, but much of 2022 had been relatively quiet for the cryptocurrency market.
Last week, central banks around the world, including the US, UK and Australia, raised interest rates as they attempt to tackle rising prices.
US Federal Reserve raised its key lending rate by half a percentage point, marking its biggest rate hike in more than 20 years.
riggered more concerns among some investors that inflation and the higher cost of borrowing could have a major impact on global economic growth.
Investors are also worried about the impact of the war in Ukraine on the world economy.
Meanwhile, in the last year Bitcoin has become legal tender in two countries - El Salvador and the Central African Republic.
Since El Salvador said it would allow consumers to use the cryptocurrency in all transactions, alongside the US dollar, the International Monetary Fund has urged it to reverse its decision.

business	How Singapore is turning multi-storey car parks into farms	"Eyleen Goh runs a farm from the top deck of a car park in Singapore.
And this is not a small operation - it supplies nearby retailers with up to 400kg of vegetables a day, she says.
""Singapore is quite small but we have many car parks. It is pretty much the dream to have farms [here] to meet the needs of residents in the community,"" she says.
At least a dozen of these rooftop farms have now sprouted up across the South East Asian city state.
government started leasing out the unusual plots in 2020 as part of its plans to increase local food production. The country of 5.5m people currently imports more than 90% of its food.
But space in this densely populated island nation is scarce and that means land is not cheap. Singapore has some of the world's most expensive property.
One farmer told the BBC that the high cost of his first car park plot meant that he had to give it up and move to a cheaper location.
When BBC News visited Ms Goh's farm, which is about the third of the size of a football field, operations were in full swing.
Workers were picking, trimming and packing choy sum, a leafy green vegetable used in Chinese cooking.
At the other end of the facility meanwhile, another employee was busy re-potting seedlings.
""We are harvesting every day. Depending on the vegetables we are growing, it can range from 100kg to 200kg to 400kg per day,"" Ms Goh says.
She says starting the farm cost around S$1m ($719,920; Â£597,720), with much of the money being spent on equipment to help speed up harvesting.
Although she has received some subsidies, Ms Goh says her business is not profitable yet.
She has 10 employees and pays a rent of around S$90,000 a year for the space and another car park site, which is still being set up.
""Our setting up period happened during the Covid pandemic, so logistics were way more expensive and took a longer time,"" Ms Goh explains.
""Moreover, this was the first rooftop car park tender awarded [by the government] so the process was very new to everyone,"" she adds.
Singapore's rooftop farmers are also finding other ways to make money.
Nicholas Goh, who is not related to Ms Goh, says he has managed to turn a profit by charging people a monthly fee to harvest vegetables at his urban farm.
He says the idea is particularly popular with families who live nearby as ""it is a community kind of approach, rather than a commercial approach"".
However, another urban farmer, Mark Lee, says high costs have driven him to move to an industrial building that charges a ""negligible"" i.e. lower rent.
""Vegetables are ultimately just vegetables. You can get it at the freshest and best quality but there is limitation to how much one would pay. We're not talking about truffles here,"" Mr Lee says.
Rooftop farms are not the only way Singapore aims to increase the amount of food it grows.
Most of the country's home-grown produce comes from high-tech facilities that are heavily subsidised by the government. It had 238 licensed farms in 2020, according to official figures.
Some of the farms are already profitable, and can expand their production to increase profits, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) says. 
""Food security is an existential issue for Singapore. As a globally connected small city-state with limited resources, Singapore is vulnerable to external shocks and supply disruptions,"" an SFA spokesperson tells BBC News.
""This is why it is important that we continuously take steps to secure our essential resources,"" the spokesperson adds.
Earlier this year, the issue of food security came into sharp focus in Singapore when several countries in the region banned or limited exports of key foods.
Governments reliant on imports tried to protect their food supplies as the Ukraine war and the pandemic pushed up the cost of everything from staple foods to crude oil.
By 2030, Singapore aims to produce 30% of the food it consumes itself - more than three times the current amount.
Professor William Chen of Singapore's Nanyang Technological University says more support should be offered to urban farms.
""There are measures in place such as productivity grants from SFA, and regular farmers' markets to encourage consumers to buy more local produce,"" says Prof Chen, who is a director of the university's food science and technology programme.
""Perhaps helping local farmers to adopt simple technologies... may be considered,"" he says.
However, Sonia Akter, an assistant professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, believes high operating costs are likely to remain a major challenge for urban farmers.
""Singapore is offering a lot of subsidies and financial support to entrepreneurs who are working in this space,"" she says.
""The question is whether these farms will be able to operate and be commercially viable when the government support stops flowing.""
Back on a rooftop surrounded by tower blocks in the midst of Singapore's urban sprawl, Ms Goh may seem a world away from traditional agriculture.
However, she echoes the sentiments of generations of farmers who have come before her: ""Giving up is not an option. The more challenging it is, the more rewarding it will be.""

politics	Rishi Sunak 'confident' of NI Protocol talks breakthrough	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said he is confident that ""with goodwill and pragmatism"" a breakthrough can happen in negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
He was speaking after talks with Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin following a meeting of the British-Irish Council.
Mr Sunak said his focus was to find a ""negotiated solution"" with the EU.
He was ""pleased with the progress that we're making"" on the protocol issue.
He also said he was ""determined to deliver"" the restoration of power-sharing at Stormont, which has not functioned since February.
use the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is refusing to take its place in the devolved government in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.
rotocol is a part of the UK-EU Brexit deal that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with some EU trade rules.
Mr Martin said that he and Mr Sunak had agreed there was a ""window of opportunity"" to resolve issues regarding the protocol.
He said it was clear that ""the prime minister desires a negotiated resolution... that works"".
Blackpool's tourism season may be long over but politicians from across the UK and Ireland have descended upon the seaside resort.
Except, that is, for Northern Ireland's politicians, who can't attend while Stormont remains in stalemate and ministers aren't in office.
Outside the hotel where the various administrations are meeting stands one of Blackpool Pleasure Beach's many rollercoasters.
uns about the highs and lows of recent Anglo-Irish relations could write themselves.
Rishi Sunak and MicheÃ¡l Martin sang largely from the same hymn sheet after their meeting.
But they gave little away about what comes next or how long a deal on the Northern Ireland Protocol could still take.
UK government's decision to extend the period for forming an executive at Stormont has bought Number 10 and the EU extra time to find a solution.
With both Dublin and London conscious that the Good Friday Agreement's 25th anniversary is next April they may now see that as the ultimate deadline.
British-Irish Council summit is taking place in Blackpool on Thursday and Friday.
uncil is made up of representatives from the UK and Irish governments, the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the governments of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey.
It was created two decades ago as a result of the Good Friday peace agreement.
Its stated aim is to ""promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relations among the peoples of these islands"".
Mr Sunak was the first prime minister to attend a council summit since 2007.
It is the 38th summit and the first time a Conservative prime minister has attended.
rime minister met First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon and First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford at the summit.
Also in attendance were Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove.
However the Stormont stalemate means there are no ministers in place from Northern Ireland to take part.
f an executive means Northern Ireland is being represented by Jayne Brady, the head of the civil service.
At the meeting Mr Sunak called for the governments to work together in ""shared interests"".
""Let's deliver for all our people across these great islands and build a future defined not by division but by unity and hope,"" he said.
rime minister also reiterated his commitment to restoring the Northern Ireland Executive, and said he was ""determined to deliver"" to restore power-sharing.
Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is also attending the two-day event.
On Wednesday he announced that he was extending the deadline for an executive to be formed at Stormont, and cutting the wages of assembly members.
Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said Mr Sunak's attendance was ""welcome but we need more than a change of mood music"".
""We need clarity and certainty about how the British intend to use the next number of weeks to ensure we will start 2023 with the assembly and executive in place,"" she added.
DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said any outcome of UK-EU negotiations on the protocol must have cross-community support in Northern Ireland.

technology	How Ukraine is winning the social media war	"After almost eight months, the war in Ukraine hangs in the balance. Ukrainian counter-offensives continue to make progress, while Russian forces are still pressing elsewhere.
But on the internet, it's a very one-sided affair.
""This is a meme nation,"" says Olena, a Kyiv entrepreneur who manages teams of social media volunteers.
""If this was a war of memes, we would be winning.""
Olena is not her real name. Due to the sensitive nature of the work she and her teams carry out on behalf of Ukraine's defence ministry, she has asked to remain anonymous. 
Her teams work round-the-clock, reacting within hours to news from around the country, producing punchy videos, often set to music, for the ministry's audiences at home and abroad.
Just as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky tailors speeches to foreign parliaments to take account of local history, culture and sensibility, so Olena's five-strong international team target their messages.
A June video thanking Britain for its military assistance featured the music of Gustav Holst and The Clash, with glimpses of Shakespeare, David Bowie, Lewis Hamilton and a montage of British-supplied anti-tank weapons in action. 
More recently, French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to supply Caesar self-propelled guns was greeted with a video which declared: ""Romantic gestures take many forms"".
Images of red roses, chocolates, the Paris skyline, followed by the guns in action, were set - perhaps inevitably - to the sound of Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin's breathless Je T'aime Moi Non Plus.
With nods to a Macron-Zelensky bromance, it was suggestive and thoroughly tongue-in-cheek.
Olena says one of her favourite ""thank you"" videos praised Sweden for its value-for-money investment in Ukraine: $20,000 (Â£17,900) Carl Gustav rocket launchers, capable of knocking out Russian T-90 tanks worth $4.5m.
une? You guessed it: Abba's Money, Money, Money.
ks to the team's efforts, the defence ministry's Twitter feed now has 1.5m followers around the world. Some of the videos have been viewed more than a million times.
r most successful video, released in August after several mysterious attacks on Russian targets in annexed Crimea, has racked up 2.2m views. It mocked Russians for going on holiday on the peninsula and was set to the Bananarama song Cruel Summer.
""The main idea is to speak to the international audience and show that Ukraine is actually capable of winning,"" she says. ""Because nobody wants to invest in losers.""
But another of Olena's teams carries out more subversive work, designed to highlight Russian losses and demoralise Ukraine's invaders. 
With a wealth of videos depicting Russian military setbacks being posted on social media platforms, the team is not short of material. But they've learned through trial and error what works and what doesn't.
""We started displaying dead Russian bodies,"" Olena says. ""And then we realised that it actually didn't work. It only united them against us.""
m then tried to appeal to the consciences of Russian soldiers by showing images of dead Ukrainian civilians. Again, it seemed to fall on deaf ears.
""We realised they were actually proud of it. They were not condemning this at all,"" she says. ""We realised that we have to do this in a much more sophisticated way.""
Now the volunteers scrutinise Russian social media platforms, looking to press buttons and probe weaknesses in specific parts of the country. 
""If you do it in Saratov you have to know what's going on in Saratov,"" Olena says. ""If you do it in Nizhny Novgorod, you have to know what's going on in Nizhny Novgorod.""
It's extremely hard to gauge the impact this work is having, but Vladimir Putin's recent partial mobilisation has given the volunteers lots of material to work with. 
""We were waiting for the mobilisation,"" Olena says. ""We knew that it would be very demoralising for them.""
gle richest seam of material is to be found on the messaging service Telegram. Olena calls it ""the Wild Wild West"".
unteers providing material for the defence ministry are just a small part of a vast, vibrant, fiercely patriotic and wildly irreverent community reacting to events on the ground, sometimes with amazing speed.
Scores of Telegram channels attract huge numbers of followers.
One, called ""Ukrainian Offensive"", has 96,485 followers. Its slogan is ""fighting on the civil-meme frontlines of the information war since 2014.""
It provides a diet of military updates, out-and-out trolling of Moscow and occasional digs at Western media coverage (including the BBC).
Like most other channels, it doesn't shy away from showing suffering, including footage of dead or dying Russian soldiers.
recent explosion on Russia's Kerch Bridge, linking Russia with occupied Crimea, triggered a tidal wave of videos, jokes and memes as Ukraine's internet army celebrated wildly. 
But the country didn't turn into a nation of digital ninjas overnight. Eight years of war in the eastern Donbas region has given people lots of time to hone their skills, from countering disinformation to circulating humorous content designed to boost morale.
More on the information war:
urrent social media environment, says Ihor Solovey, head of Ukraine's Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security, reflects a rare convergence of official and popular sentiment.
""We're witnessing perhaps the first time in history when civil society trusts the state and is helping it,"" he told me. 
""The armed forces do their own thing, while society is creating content, memes, creative works on their own. Because everyone feels responsible for their own future.""
What, if anything, is Russia throwing back at Ukraine?
Strangely, given Russia's reputation for troll farms and shady scammers with alleged links to the Kremlin, the answer seems to be: not much.
Earlier this month, two well-known Russian pranksters did manage to con Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba into thinking he was talking to a former US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul. 
Excerpts were broadcast on Russian state media, in which Mr Kuleba appeared to admit that Ukraine was responsible for recent attacks in Crimea and Russia - although the prank was conducted before the 8 October Kerch Bridge explosion.
But if Russia does have a similarly inventive internet army, Olena says she has seen little sign of it.
""Russians haven't managed to come up with anything interesting,"" she says. ""No humour, no beauty. Not even pain. No compassion."""	/news/world-europe-63272202
technology	Instagram 'wrong' to take down drill music video	"wner of Instagram has been told it should not have removed a drill music video.
Meta took down the video by Chinx (OS) after being contacted by the London Metropolitan Police, which raised concerns about gang violence.
But Meta's independent Oversight Board has ruled there was insufficient evidence to support that decision.
It said the case highlighted the ""haphazard and opaque"" way authorities made such requests. 
Metropolitan Police says it ""works closely"" with social media platforms to identify content it believes could provoke violence.
But it insists the platforms ""make their own decisions regarding removal of content.""
In January this year an Instagram account which described itself as promoting British music posted about a new drill track called Secrets Not Safe.
Shortly afterwards, Meta says, Scotland Yard contacted it to raise concerns about ""gang violence"" relating to the song.
Meta conducted its own review and decided the track contained a ""veiled threat"" linked to a shooting in 2017 and so removed it from Instagram.
It then referred the case to its independent system of appeals, the Oversight Board, which was set up and is funded by Meta. It is staffed by academics and lawyers, with the remit of scrutinising and questioning the tech giant's actions.
rd has now concluded the decision to remove the song from Instagram was wrong because the threat of violence was not credible. It says the track must be reinstated.
It also says there are serious concerns that drill - which is particularly popular among young black Britons - is being overpoliced.
Chinx (OS) told the BBC he was pleased the video would be restored and had not understood why it had been taken down in the first place.
He said he did ""not believe"" that his music would incite violence. 
""I can see why people think it's very violent but I feel like it's an expression,"" he said. 
""I think people are involved in a certain lifestyle prior to them releasing drill music. 
""I don't think you release drill music then find yourself in gang activities - I feel it's the other way around."" 
rd called on Meta to create a ""globally consistent system"" for content removal requests from official bodies - emphasising ""not every piece of content that law enforcement would prefer to have taken down should be taken down"".
""It is therefore critical that Meta evaluates these requests independently, particularly when they relate to artistic expression from individuals in minority or marginalised groups for whom the risk of cultural bias against their content is acute.""
As part of its investigation, Meta's Oversight Board said it filed multiple freedom of information requests with the Met Police.
It said it found the force had filed 286 requests with social media and streaming companies to take down or review posts about drill music in the 12 months from June 2021, and that 255 of those had resulted in the removal of content.
Over the same period, it had not made a single request to remove any other music genre, the force said.
A Meta spokesperson said: ""We do not remove content simply because law enforcement requests it - we take action if content is found to violate our policies or local law. 
""As part of our robust review process, we assess whether a request is consistent with internationally-recognized standards on human rights, including due process, privacy, free expression and the rule of law.""
Detective Chief Superintendent Nick Blackburn, from the Metropolitan Police, defended the force's actions:    
""Our aim is to prevent threats and intimidation in the virtual world leading to real harm in our communities"", he said.
""Investigators always target threats of violence and other potentially criminal activity and not any specific genre of music.""                                        
Steven Keogh, a former detective with the Metropolitan Police, told the BBC that in his experience of investigating gang-related murders in London ""all bar none"" had ""some connection"" to drill tracks.

business	Morrisons to close 132 McColl's stores putting jobs at risk	"Morrisons says it plans to close 132 of its loss-making McColl's convenience stores, putting 1,300 jobs at risk.
It comes after the supermarket chain agreed to buy McColl's out of administration in May.
Workers who could be made redundant will be offered jobs elsewhere in the business, the grocer said.
Morrisons now plans to convert most of its remaining McColl's stores into Morrisons Daily shops as it tries to revive the chain's fortunes.
re are currently 1,164 McColl's stores trading, 286 of which operate under the Morrisons Daily brand.  
Morrisons said all of the stores set to close were ""loss-making"" and had ""no realistic prospect"" of recovering soon.
re distributed around England, Scotland and Wales.
majority will be closed ""in an orderly fashion"" over the rest of this year, it added.
grocer said workers at risk of redundancy ""will be offered alternative employment at a nearby McColl's store, Morrisons store, logistics operation or food-making centre"".
Out of the stores that will close, 55 have a Post Office counter.
Morrisons said it would will delay the closure of these stores until next year to let them serve local communities during Christmas ""and to allow the Post Office additional time to make alternative arrangements"".
Last week competition regulators cleared Morrisons to buy McColl's.
upermarket chain had already said it would sell 28 McColl's stores to overcome competition concerns.
McColl's is a business ""of significant scale"", Morrisons added, with an annual turnover of Â£1.2bn. It accounts for about 0.8% of the UK grocery market, it added.
It said no further store closures were currently being considered but it remains in talks with ""a number of landlords of challenged stores"".
Morrisons' chief executive David Potts said after the green light from the competition watchdog, the retailer was ""now able to begin the urgent journey to transform McColl's into a viable, well-invested and growing operation"".
Mr Potts added that following the store conversions, there would be more than 1,000 Morrisons Daily stores trading within two years.
Joseph Sutton, the director of Morrisons wholesale, said: ""We very much regret the proposed closure of 132 loss-making stores but it is, very sadly, an important step towards the regeneration of the business."""	/news/business-63407159
sports	Tokyo Olympics: British medal hope Amber Hill withdraws after testing positive for Covid-19	"British medal hope Amber Hill has withdrawn from the women's skeet competition at this summer's Olympics after testing positive for Covid-19.
World number one Hill won silver at the shooting World Cup in May and finished sixth at the Rio 2016 Games.
Hill says she is ""absolutely devastated"" by the news, which came before she had left for Japan.
She was due to participate in Sunday's qualifying event with the final scheduled to take place on Monday. 
British Olympic Association confirmed Hill's positive test and added there would be no replacement for the 23-year-old.
""There are no words to describe how I'm feeling right now,"" Hill said.
""After five years of training and preparation, I'm absolutely devastated to say that last night I received a positive Covid-19 test, meaning I've had to withdraw from Team GB's shooting team.
""Although I don't have any symptoms, I will now isolate as per the government guidance."" 
Swimmer Ilya Borodin, 2020 European champion in the men's 400m individual medley, will also miss the Games, the Russian Swimming Federation said.
18-year-old tested positive for coronavirus during a training camp before departing for Japan.
One athlete who feared her Games might be over after she was identified as a close contact of a member of the public who tested positive on the flight to Japan has been given hope she can compete.
British 400m hurdler Jessie Knight was part of a group of six athletes identified as a close contact of someone two rows away on her flight.
""When I was initially told, I was just told 'Oh Jessie we need to speak to you' so my heart dropped and to be honest I thought I'd tested positive,"" the 27-year-old told BBC Sport. ""The fact that I was just a close contact, I was really relieved.""
rotocols in place mean she is isolated from athletes who have not been affected but with twice-a-day testing, and social distancing between her and her coach, she is still able to train.
""You don't want to miss 14 days of training going into the biggest race of your life so I was panicking but it was communicated so quickly that I would be able to train so long as we were providing those negative tests.""
m GB chef de mission Mark England said: ""This is a rule that was presented to everybody only in the last 48 hours by the IOC and Tokyo 2020.
""Any athlete in the Olympic Games that has been contacted for track-and-trace and is isolating, as long as they presenting negative tests they are allowed to enter the field of play.""
Knight is due to compete in the early rounds of the women's 400m hurdles on 31 July."	/sport/olympics/57917553
technology	Popular Minecraft YouTuber Dream reveals face	"Popular YouTuber Dream has for years been known to his fans only as a cartoon smiley face.
Minecraft gamer, with 30 million subscribers online, only ever uses his voice in streams - albeit occasionally appearing on camera wearing a mask.
But all that looked set to change after his friends - and other YouTubers - posted videos apparently reacting to Dream without his mask.
He then posted a video revealing his face for the first time.
Minecraft is the world's bestselling video game and Dream's most popular videos have tens of millions of views, with one having been watched more than 115 million times.
""Hi, my name is Clay, otherwise known as Dream,"" he said in a five-minute video viewed more than 12 million times.
With a friend moving to the US, where Dream is based, he wanted to be able to go out more, without worrying about leaks or speculation, he said.
""I've been bunkered up,"" Dream said. ""The people trying to leak my face, trying to find out what I look like... it's just a tiny bit too much.""
His face would remain absent from his Minecraft videos, he said, but he may start making ""IRL content"" - set in real life - with his friends.
In the days leading up to his public reveal, Dream showed his face to several close contacts, asking them to post their reactions online.
One, Karl Jacobs, who said he was among Dream's best friends, said he ""looks like a baseball player"".
And almost a million people have watched a video of Dream revealing his face to popular technology YouTuber Marques Brownlee - despite the two never having spoken before meeting virtually.
""This channel is living proof that anyone can do anything,"" Dream said. 
""Anyone can be under the mask and I don't want my face reveal to take away from that fact - Dream could have been anyone from anywhere.

politics	MSPs debating changes to gender reforms	"MSPs are debating final changes to controversial gender recognition reforms.
Scottish government legislation is aimed at simplifying and speeding up the process for trans people to change their legally recognised gender. 
Supporters say the reforms will make the process less intrusive, bureaucratic and medicalised. 
Critics say they could put vulnerable young people at risk and undermine protections for women and girls.
Supporters and opponents of the bill have started gathering outside Holyrood ahead of the voting process getting under way.
Around 150 amendments have been put forward, with MSPs expected to sit late into the evening before a final crunch vote on Wednesday.
Conservative MSPs have accused the government of trying to avoid proper scrutiny by rushing the legislation through parliament before Christmas. 
Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill removes the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria to acquire a gender recognition certificate (GRC). 
It cuts the need to live in their acquired gender from two years to three months, with a further three month period of reflection, and it lowers the age for applicants from 18 to 16. 
Ahead of the votes, Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison wrote to three MSPs asking them to withdraw proposed changes to the legislation or risk delaying its passage through parliament. 
In a letter seen by BBC Scotland, Ms Robison warned the MSPs that their amendments would put the Bill at ""serious risk"" of being outwith Holyrood's competence, adding that if they are passed, ministers would be forced to delay the final vote on the legislation. 
minister has written to Labour's Jackie Baillie regarding an amendment that seeks to clarify the application of UK-wide equality laws. 
r was also sent to Scottish Conservative MSP Russell Findlay and SNP backbencher Michelle Thomson. 
mendments that seek to provide extra safeguards in relation to applications by sex offenders. 
Ms Robison said the changes risked being incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. 
Supporters of the bill  have begun to gather outside the Scottish Parliament ahead of the first of two days of debate. 
More than 60 Scottish LGBT+ organisations have written to MSPs in support of the legislation, including Highland Pride. 
Sand Owsnett, who chairs the group, said: ""The current gender recognition process is outdated, dehumanising and excludes many trans people. 
""The proposed reforms would not only bring Scotland closer to international best practice, but also uphold trans people's human rights.""
MSPs are in for a marathon session, as they debate and vote on around 150 proposed changes to the legislation.
Amendments from three MSPs have caused the Scottish government particular concern. Ministers believe the changes being put forward by Jackie Baillie, Russell Findlay and Michelle Thomson could cause the legislation to fall foul of Holyrood's competence, and therefore leave the bill open to legal challenge.
Should they pass, the government is warning it would have to withdraw the bill and send it back to the equalities committee for further consideration.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison will be hoping her intervention deters the MSPs from pressing their amendments to a vote - and deters MSPs across the chamber from supporting them.
She doesn't want to risk this legislation falling at the final hurdle, although that risk seems small.  It would be a tall order for the three MSPs to garner enough backing.
Bill is controversial, with some concerned that it could make it easier for predatory men to access single sex spaces like refuges and prisons. 
UN's special rapporteur on violence against women and girls has warned that the reforms could allow violent men to ""abuse"" the system. 
Scottish government has repeatedly said a new law would not affect the Equality Act 2010, which allows trans people to be excluded from some single sex spaces. 
An amendment from Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy already backed by MSPs puts this assertion on the face of the Bill. 
Ms Duncan-Glancy said the party had lodged further amendments designed to clarify the application of the Equality Act and protection of single-sex spaces. 
""Labour's priority is to make this a bill both trans people and the wider public can have confidence in,"" she said. 
""MSPs need to work together to protect human rights across the board and deliver a workable de-medicalised gender recognition process.""
On Monday Lord McConnell, a former first minister, said the legislation should be ""paused"" following a Court of Session ruling last week that sex was ""not limited to biological or birth sex"".
""The Scottish Parliament was set up to pass good legislation and to improve public debate in Scotland and I think in this case, we've seen the opposite happen,"" he told BBC Scotland. 
However one of his successors as Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, wrote in support of the bill in The Times and criticised the ""populist"" tactics of its opponents. 
She pointed to the findings of a UN gender identity expert who found that in countries which already use self-determination, there was no evidence the laws were being abused by predatory men. 
Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservatives have warned that the debate could lead to a ""travesty of democracy"" because a 15 minute time limit for each proposal will ""shut down"" discussion.
Scottish Conservative equalities spokeswoman Rachael Hamilton MSP said: ""Recent polling suggests our concerns are shared by the majority of Scots, who are supportive of trans rights but also want women and girls to have safe spaces - and are rightly worried about teenagers being given the green light to do something they later regret. 
""Rushing this through before Christmas is typical of the SNP's attempts to railroad this legislation through parliament without proper scrutiny.""
But the Scottish Greens - who are in government with the SNP - described it as ""the most scrutinised Bill in the history of the Scottish Parliament"". 
""This is a significant and important Bill, but it has been met with one of the most spiteful and dangerous campaigns of disinformation since the lies against repealing Section 28,""MSP  Maggie Chapman said. 
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that some people have ""genuinely held concerns"" about the plans but argued that others have latched on to the issue to spread transphobia."	/news/uk-scotland-64032916

politics	Rishi Sunak: Northern Ireland issues to test new PM	"It is a given that political leaders come and go, but never have prime ministers regenerated quite so rapidly.
recent parallels between Downing Street and Doctor Who do not end there.
Like the show, which on Sunday brought back David Tennant as the charismatic Time Lord, in politics there is now talk of Julian Smith returning as Northern Ireland Secretary.
Whether that is just wishful thinking, or an actual possibility, is up to Rishi Sunak.
He was a vocal supporter of the former chancellor, who now has the biggest role in UK politics, having lost out to Liz Truss after his first audition to Tory members.
And given the new prime minister has to oversee a looming deadline in Northern Ireland this week, who he sends there will be important.
urrent Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is not exactly a fan of Rishi Sunak. 
He was intimately involved in the campaign for a Boris Johnson comeback, despite being one of many cabinet ministers who had urged him to resign in the summer.
On Monday, Mr Heaton-Harris changed his stance, pledging to back Mr Sunak.
Convention goes that he could be sacked as Mr Sunak chooses his cabinet, unless he opts to retain some Johnson supporters, which is not impossible, given there is absolutely nothing conventional about politics at the moment.
re is the endorsement Team Sunak received from Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker on Sunday. 
In a significant step, the outspoken Brexiteer - who previously backed Liz Truss - said Mr Sunak was the right candidate to solve the Northern Ireland Protocol dispute and unite the Tory party.
It is possible Mr Baker's support could land him a promotion to the top job in the Northern Ireland Office.
Or it could even end up going to another MP unknown to most here before landing in Belfast, which would mean a fourth NI Secretary in four months. 
Ultimately, whoever is in the job by this Friday, 28 October, will have a call to make. 
Do they push ahead with what Mr Heaton-Harris vowed: that if, by 00:01 BST on Friday, an executive at Stormont has not reformed, a date for another assembly election will be set?
Or, does the new Sunak administration change tack and introduce last-minute legislation to delay the deadline?
Or, does it push back any talk of polls for several weeks, given that there is a 12-week period built into the current law in which to hold a fresh election?
None of the political parties at Stormont are in favour of another election and instead hope a reset at Westminster could prevent a pre-Christmas poll.
ugh given the chaos still consuming Westminster, we cannot quite rule out a general election happening sooner than is scheduled in two years' time.
Election or no election yet, the Northern Ireland Protocol remains an issue that neither of Mr Sunak's predecessors managed to sort out.
While he did vote for Brexit in the 2016 referendum, the new PM was not initially in favour of the controversial NI Protocol bill - legislation that sought to scrap large parts of the original deal.
Introduced by Liz Truss to parliament during her brief stint as foreign secretary and currently being scrutinised in the Lords, can those still backing it be sure of its future under a new government? 
re is also the question of how Mr Sunak will be received by the DUP, which privately backed his rival in the last leadership race and expressed concerns about how he would manage the protocol dispute. 
Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in has in recent days argued that the British and Irish governments will have to consider joint authority, if devolution remains mothballed.
Rishi Sunak only made his first visit to Northern Ireland in the summer, attending the Tory leadership hustings at a hotel outside Belfast.
While he spoke briefly about wanting to renegotiate the protocol, there was zero detail during a half-hour Q&A and he has yet to be tested on virtually all policies relating to Northern Ireland.
re are also questions for him as to when exactly households in Northern Ireland will get access to the Â£400 energy bills discount, which were promised by Liz Truss and Boris Johnson's respective administrations.
Few expect Northern Ireland to rank highly on the new government's agenda, but, just days into being, it will have some big decisions to make about this place.
No longer the understudy, how Rishi Sunak handles Northern Ireland will play a part in how the biggest performance of his political career is eventually rated."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63371828
politics	Rishi Sunak's G20 meeting with Chinese president cancelled	"A planned meeting between Rishi Sunak and Chinese President Xi Jinping has been cancelled after a missile blast in Poland.
unter, at the G20 summit in Indonesia, was due to be the first in-person meeting between a British PM and Chinese leader since 2018.
Early reports had suggested Russia was to blame for the blast, near Ukraine. Moscow has denied the allegations.
A No 10 spokesperson blamed ""scheduling issues"" for the cancellation.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said she had no information to offer on the cancellation of the meeting.
Polish President Andrzej Duda told reporters it remained unclear how the blast had occurred, and said investigators were evaluating all possibilities.
""We do not have any conclusive evidence at the moment as to who launched this missileâ¦ it was most likely a Russian-made missile, but this is all still under investigation at the moment,"" he said.
US President Joe Biden has said it is ""unlikely"" the missile was fired from Russia.
Speaking at press conference at the summit, Mr Sunak said the UK and its allies were still trying to ""get to the bottom of what happened"" and it was ""right that we let that process conclude"".
meeting between Mr Sunak and President Xi was set to take place against a backdrop of worsening relations between London and Beijing in recent years over security, Hong Kong and China's human right record.
Downing Street had said the prime minister would ""encourage China to use its place on the global stage responsibly to resolve geopolitical tensions, ensure regional stability and play its part in tackling the devastating global impact of the war in Ukraine"".
Commons Foreign Affairs Committee chairwoman Alicia Kearns said it was ""a shame"" that the PM's meeting had been cancelled, adding that dialogue was ""vital"".
""The trust deficit is palpable at this time, and meeting was important to set out our positions and build the ground to prevent miscalculations,"" she said.
Some Conservative MPs have called on the government to take a tougher stance on China.
Last year five MPs and two peers were sanctioned by China after raising concerns about human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority group in Xinjiang.
Mr Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss was reportedly planning to re-categorise China as a ""threat"" to the UK as part of a foreign policy review.
On Tuesday, asked whether he would do the same, Mr Sunak told reporters: ""I think that China unequivocally poses a systemic threat - well, a systemic challenge - to our values and our interests and is undoubtedly the biggest state-based threat to our economic security.""
But he added that it would not be possible to resolve global challenges like climate change or the war in Ukraine ""without having a dialogue with them""."	/news/uk-politics-63646635

Crypto mining uses computers to generate virtual coins for profit - a process that consumes significant amounts of computing power.
Customers around the world are said to have purchased more than half a billion dollars' worth of HashFlare contracts from 2015 to 2019. But the operation allegedly overstated its capabilities.

technology	Hong Kong anthem: Google won't alter search results amid protest song row	"Google says it does not manipulate its search results amid a row over where Hong Kong's national anthem appears.
Hong Kong had demanded that the search engine bury results for Glory to Hong Kong, a popular protest song.
Instead, China's national anthem should appear as the top search result, with the territory's leader John Lee saying it was a ""moral issue"". 
rotest song was accidentally played for Hong Kong athletes at two recent events.
""Google handles billions of search queries every day, so we build ranking systems to automatically surface relevant, high quality, and helpful information,"" the tech giant told AFP news agency.
""We do not manually manipulate organic web listings to determine the ranking of a specific page,"" it added.
Glory to Hong Kong was heard at a rugby game in South Korea last month instead of the Chinese national anthem March of the Volunteers.
Asia Rugby Association said staff had downloaded the wrong music after selecting the top search result for the term ""Hong Kong national anthem"" from the internet.
f the protest song was also displayed on the screen while the Chinese national anthem was being played at an earlier rugby game.
Earlier this month Glory to Hong Kong was played for weightlifter Susanna Lin at an awards ceremony in Dubai.
On Monday Hong Kong's security chief Chris Tang said Google had refused the city's requests, using the company's algorithm as a justification, and described this as ""unconvincing"".
He accused Google of double standards, citing the firm's response following the EU's top court's ruling that the company must delete results about people if they can prove the information to be untrue.
On Wednesday China's foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Beijing supported the Hong Kong government's actions ""upholding the dignity of the national anthem"".
He said internet companies had an obligation to deliver correct information.
Police are investigating whether the anthem mix-up in South Korea violated Hong Kong's national security law. Beijing imposed the controversial law in 2020 to end dissent after democracy protests and says it applies worldwide.
However the tech giant - which is banned in mainland China but is accessible in Hong Kong and has an office there - said it was in contact with Hong Kong's government to explain ""how our platforms and removal policies work"".
""We do not remove web results except for specific reasons outlined in our global policy documentation,"" the company statement said.
Both Mr Tang and Mr Lee have said the Hong Kong government will make another request to Google.
It is not the first time that Google has tangled with the Hong Kong authorities. The company suspended cooperation with Hong Kong police on data requests after the national security law came into force.
Earlier this year YouTube, which is owned by Google, terminated John Lee's channel saying this was because Mr Lee had been sanctioned by the US for curtailing civil liberties.

health	Ben Nelson-Roux: Teen 'spiralled' before hostel death, inquest told	"mental health of a 16-year-old boy was ""spiralling downwards"" before he was found dead at an adult homeless hostel, his family has told an inquest.
f Ben Nelson-Roux was found by his mother at the hostel in Harrogate in April 2020. 
He was a drug user and was exploited by ""county lines"" drug dealers, the inquest into his death was told.
His father, Barry Nelson, told the coroner's inquest on Friday: ""It was impossible to keep him safe."" 
Giving evidence at Northallerton Coroner's Court, Ben's parents described how their son struggled with self-harm and anxiety from the age of eight.
He was later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and began taking drugs, the inquest heard.
Mr Nelson said Ben started becoming violent while living at his mother, Kate Roux's, house, so an annexe was converted into a self-contained flat for him to live in.
""He came from a loving, supportive family of people who cared about [him] and would do anything for [him],"" Mr Nelson said.
""Ben just seemed to have lost interest in things he used to absolutely love. It was obvious to us as a family that his mental health was spiralling downwards.""
Mr Nelson added: ""As a parent it was extremely difficult.""
He told the coroner's court that Ben was living with Ms Roux, but knew he was also welcome to come and live with him.
His son had decided to become voluntarily homeless because he ""had been seduced by the promise of his own flat by social workers"", Mr Nelson said.
Kate Roux described Ben as a ""bright, sunny, creative, kind boy from a loving, supportive family"".
She said her son had moved into the separate flat after he became violent.
He had been threatened by drug dealers and had also been taken to A&E due to self-harm, she told the inquest.
Ben had been in contact with police multiple times in the year before his death, Ms Roux said.
""Nobody could persuade Ben to let us help and keep him safe,"" she added.
Ms Roux said a total of 12 agencies were involved in Ben's care and in the last meeting before his death ""all parties expressed concern for his well-being"".
""Everybody agreed there was a high risk of death by misadventure,"" she said.
However, she added that there was ""no rehab, no suitable accommodation, no psychiatric support, no child protection plan"" in place for him.
Ms Roux said she had arranged an appointment for Ben with a private psychiatrist.
It was when she went to the hostel in Harrogate on 8 April 2020 to pick up Ben for that meeting that she found him dead, she said.
quest was adjourned and is expected to conclude in December.

ft in chronic pain after operations by Prof Sam Eljamel at Dundee's Ninewells Hospital
A damning Scottish government report last month accused NHS Tayside of letting patients down.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he expected NHS Tayside to give the issue the highest priority - a police investigation is also ongoing.
Dozens of patients are also calling for an external and independent review of what happened to them.
ged a protest to highlight their cause outside Ninewells Hospital. 
Scottish government has turned down calls for a public inquiry.
Prof Eljamel, the former head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside in Dundee, harmed dozens of patients before he was suspended in 2013.
He was allowed to voluntarily remove himself from the General Medical Council's register and is now working as a surgeon in Libya.
Elizabeth Rose from L&M MediLaw said she had been approached by some of Eljamel's patients to look into any harm they experienced under his care, as well as the actions or omissions of Tayside Health Board. 
wyer also backed the patients' calls for a public inquiry.
She said: ""Although our investigations are at very early stages, a public inquiry would allow those affected to understand what happened to them and why.""
Jules Rose was among those protesting outside Ninewells Hospital.
After her operation in 2013, Ms Rose discovered that Prof Eljamel had removed her tear gland instead of a tumour on her brain.
She still has not been told exactly when health bosses knew he was a risk to patients.
Ms Rose said that a class action, or group proceeding as it is known in Scotland, was being considered.
However, she said that a public inquiry was the patients' priority.
She said: ""Patients have been complaining to NHS Tayside for years and they have got nowhere.
""They have got every door closed in their face.

sports	Olympics Rewind: London 2012 - 10 things you may have forgotten	"Can you believe eight years have passed since the magical days of the London 2012 Olympics?
Moments from those Games will live with those who watched them for a lifetime - Danny Boyle's astounding opening ceremony, Super Saturday's golden rush and Andy Murray finally winning at SW19.
But what about the parts you may have forgotten? Those little moments away from the sporting action or the times when it all went a little bit skew-whiff?
's Public Display of Affection, in case you didn't know.
We certainly didn't know Jason Kenny and Laura Trott (as she was) were an item at that point, but when the world's cameras zoomed in on a certain David Beckham at a beach volleyball match, it was a kiss behind him that caught everyone's attention.
g ""for a little while"" but didn't want their budding relationship making the headlines before they competed. It had worked well - they won two gold medals apiece.
Eight years - and a further five Olympic golds - later, the Kennys are happily married and have a two-year-old son, Albie. And of course, they're targeting more success in Tokyo next year.
""Not using one's best efforts to win"".
was the view of badminton officials after two women's doubles pairs from South Korea and one each from China and Indonesia made a series of basic errors during matches.
All four pairs were accused of wanting to lose, in an attempt to manipulate the draw for the knockout stage, and were then disqualified from the competition.
China said they were aiming to preserve energy ahead of the knockout stages. The Koreans, on the other hand, tried to deflect the blame.
""The Chinese started this. They did it first,"" said South Korea's coach Sung Han-kook. Sounds like something you'd hear in the school playground...
We can all remember Mo Farah winning gold on Super Saturday, but you might have forgotten what was going on in the BBC studio at that moment. 
What a day 4 August had been. We had already seen two rowing golds and cycling gold on the track for the women's team pursuit before the fans had even taken their seats in the Olympic Stadium for the evening's festivities.
But three more golds were to come - all in the space of 46 magical minutes. First it was Jessica Ennis-Hill in the heptathlon, then Greg Rutherford in the long jump. And then Farah in the 10,000m.
um erupted as Farah crossed the line, slapping his head with disbelief. So too did the BBC studio, Colin Jackson and Michael Johnson bouncing around in their seats while Denise Lewis, having jumped out of hers some time earlier, screamed as she punched the air in ecstasy.
As newly-crowned 200m butterfly champion Chad le Clos paraded poolside, showing off his gold medal for photographers and waving to the crowd, he wasn't the only member of his family adorning himself to the public.
Up in the stands, the South African's father, Bert, was in the BBC studio, being interviewed by Clare Balding, overcome with pride at his son who had just beaten defending champion and world record holder Michael Phelps to gold.
""UNBELIEVABLE. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I've never been so happy in my life,"" he said. ""Look at him, he's BEAUTIFUL. What a beautiful boy.""
was before he then saw a glimpse of himself on TV, prompting him to feel he needed to suck in his stomach - ""sorry, sorry"" he apologised to viewers.
Don't worry Bert, we've all been there.
Another parent, another classic moment. But when your son is about to become Britain's most successful Olympian, Carol Hoy had every right to be a little nervous.
Sir Chris Hoy's mum could hardly keep her eyes on the track as he competed in the keirin, the race in which he would win his sixth and final Olympic gold medal.
Unable to sit down, every emotion flashed across her face. One moment she was clapping and pushing him on, the next she's turning away and covering her eyes with her hand.
It's her reaction when Hoy crosses the line that's best, though. ""Oh thank GOD,"" she cries.
Exactly what we were all thinking, Carol.
g ceremony was still some 48 hours away but the Olympics did not get off to the best start with a mix-up on the very first day of sporting action.
As North Korean players were being introduced before their women's football match against Colombia at Hampden Park, South Korean flags were mistakenly displayed in the video package.
quad walked off and could only be persuaded to return when the teams were announced again with each player's face displayed next to the North Korean flag, delaying kick-off by about an hour.
Germany's Robert Harting won discus gold at London 2012, but it was his celebrations after his winning throw of 68.27m that caught the eye.
Roaring before ripping his shirt off in an Incredible Hulk-esque manner, he then donned a German flag as a cape and completed a victory lap of the hurdles track.
He cleared the hurdles, yes, but probably a good job he stuck with just the discus until his retirement in 2018.
Kate Richardson-Walsh's Olympics looked as though it was over before it had barely begun when she broke her jaw in Team GB's opening match against Japan.
Britain's captain was struck by a stick on the left side of her jaw in the closing minutes of play. Footage of the incident, and the sound of her screams of pain, made for uncomfortable viewing.
She later had surgery to fix a metal plate, but remarkably missed just two games before returning - wearing a protective mask - to lead the team to the bronze medal.
Four years later in Rio, it would be a different colour...
It wouldn't be a surprise if Stephan Feck has never watched his London 2012 campaign back.
German diver, in the second preliminary round of the men's 3m springboard, landed flat on his back after his foot appeared to slip off the side of the diving board.
He was awarded a failed dive with zeros across the board, with Leon Taylor calling it a ""calamity"".
""He probably lost a toenail or two,"" said the BBC commentator and Olympic silver medallist. Ouch.
We couldn't not include this one.
Who could forget our now-Prime Minister Boris Johnson getting stuck on a zip wire for several minutes?
Mayor of London, Johnson was trying out a 45m (150ft) high zip wire at Victoria Park when it lost momentum, leaving him dangling ""like an odd Christmas decoration"", as one onlooker put it.
A spokesman for Johnson at the time said: ""Clearly the judges are likely to have marked the mayor down for artistic impression, and unlike Team GB, the mayor may not be winning too many gold medals today."""	/sport/olympics/53252880
politics	Scottish independence: Will there be a second referendum?	"UK Supreme Court has ruled that the Scottish government cannot hold an independence referendum without the Westminster government's consent.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had said she wanted a vote to take place on 19 October 2023.
urt's president, Lord Reed, said the laws that created the Scottish Parliament in 1999 meant it did not have the power to legislate on areas of the constitution - including the union between Scotland and England.
urt rejected the Scottish government's argument that any referendum would be ""advisory"", and would have no legal effect.
Lord Reed said that in the absence of an agreement between the two governments, the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to legislate for a referendum.
Yes, in September 2014, when Scottish voters were given the choice of staying in the UK or becoming an independent country. 
ked staying the UK by 55% to 45%.
In truth, it has never really gone away. 
Ms Sturgeon called for another referendum - ""indyref2"" - immediately after the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Scottish voters backed remain by 62% by 38%.
Independence supporters argued that Scotland should take its future into its own hands, and no longer be tied to the UK and its Conservative government. 
Since then Ms Sturgeon has made repeated attempts to push for another vote but there has been no agreement with the UK government.
SNP currently has a pro-independence majority in the devolved parliament alongside the Scottish Greens. It argues that its electoral success -  coupled with the Brexit vote - mean it has a ""cast-iron mandate"" to hold another referendum.
But the UK government insists it will not grant formal consent for a referendum through what is known as a Section 30 order.
was put in place ahead of the 2014 referendum. Many - but not all - experts believe such a mechanism would be needed again to ensure any future vote is legal.
Ms Sturgeon wrote to the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July asking for a similar agreement this time, but he said no. 
UK government argues that the 2014 referendum was, in Ms Sturgeon's own words at the time, a once-in-a-generation opportunity. 
Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson previously suggested that meant another one shouldn't be held for about 40 years, with Rishi Sunak - the current incumbent of No 10 - also opposed to a vote.
UK government has accused the SNP of failing to give clear answers to key questions on issues such as currency and pensions in an independent Scotland. It also warns that any attempt by Scotland to rejoin the EU would lead to a hard border between the two countries. 
Ministers also say Ms Sturgeon and her government should be focusing on recovery from the Covid pandemic and improving public services like health and education.
first minister has already started publishing a series of papers setting out the case to break away from the UK.
rgue that an independent Scotland could be ""wealthier, happier and fairer"", and that people should have the right to choose how they are governed.
first minister says she ""stands ready"" to reach an agreement with the UK government on a referendum, but expects the UK government will continue with its ""democracy denial"".
""The SNP is not abandoning the referendum route. Westminster is blocking it,"" she said.
Ms Sturgeon's intention is to make the next UK election a ""de facto referendum"", with the SNP standing on the single issue of independence.
first minister wants the SNP to hold a special party conference next year to agree the details of this plan.
In the meantime, she said the party would launch a major campaign ""in defence of Scottish democracy"".
Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice says the last half dozen polls have - on average - put support for independence at 49%, with 51% against, once ""don't know"" votes are excluded. 
uggests that the country hasn't seen the big surge in support for independence that Ms Sturgeon hoped for in the wake of Brexit, the Covid pandemic and Boris Johnson becoming prime minister. 
But with such a slender lead in the polls, the pro-UK side also cannot be confident of victory, and will be mindful of how support for independence increased before the last referendum. 
However, polling has also suggested that there are fewer undecided voters now than there were at the start of the last referendum campaign, so it may be harder for either side to win people over.
Dr Emily Gray, head of polling at Ipsos Scotland, said it was clear that the issue of Scottish independence was not going away.
She said pro-independence parties would see the Supreme Court ruling as ""another unfair block in the way of Scottish democracy"".
But she added that Nicola Sturgeon would also face questions about making the next general election a single issue vote on independence:
""When we've polled on this recently, the only route that a clear majority sees as legitimate is a referendum that both the Scottish government and the UK have agreed to."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-50813510
technology	Strava app flaw revealed runs of Israeli officials at secret bases	"A security vulnerability in the fitness app Strava allowed suspicious figures to identify and track security personnel working at secretive bases in Israel, a disinformation watchdog says.
FakeReporter found that by uploading fake running ""segments"" a user could learn the identities and past routes of others active in the area, even if they had the strongest privacy settings.
Information about 100 individuals who exercised at six bases was viewable.
Strava said it had addressed the issue.
Israeli military said it was ""aware of the evolving threats in cyberspace"".
""In order to handle these threats, and in light of previous events such as the one mentioned, the rules and regulations are regularly reiterated and reinforced among those serving in sensitive positions,"" it added.
first time that Strava's tracking features have sparked such security concerns.
In 2018, the company published a global ""heatmap"" that revealed the exercise routes of people at military bases around the world, including US facilities in Syria and Afghanistan.
San Francisco-based Strava is used by more than 95 million people in 195 countries.
Its app takes data, including GPS co-ordinates, from a person's mobile phone or wearable fitness device to track their exercise activity. 
People are able to upload their running and cycling times and compare their performances with others who followed the same routes.
FakeReporter, an Israeli group that combats malicious online activity, reported that a suspicious user named ""Ez Shehl"" had exploited these functions to upload fake GPS data to create route segments inside secret facilities associated with Israel's military, the Mossad intelligence agency and the Shin Bet internal security service.
gments featured straight GPS lines, no times, and unrealistic pacing, such as covering 500m in 0 seconds. 
mings and personal details - including photos, home addresses and the identities of family members - of other users who ran the same segments were subsequently revealed on the Strava scoreboard, even if they had their accounts set to ""private"".
A senior defence official identified as ""N"" was one of at least 100 Israeli individuals affected by the vulnerability, according to FakeReporter. It posted screenshots showing runs from their home and inside various air force bases in Israel, as well as runs in Ukraine. 
FakeReporter said it had told Israeli authorities about the security breach as soon as it became aware and that it had contacted Strava after receiving their approval.
""Despite past revelations, it does not appear that Israeli security agencies have caught up,"" Achiya Schatz, the watchdog's director, said in a statement. ""Although Strava made significant updates to its privacy settings, confused users might still be exposed publicly, even if their profiles were set to 'private'."" 
""By exploiting the capability to upload engineered files, revealing the details of users anywhere in the world, hostile elements have taken one alarming step closer to exploiting a popular app in order to harm the security of citizens and countries alike.""

technology	BeReal: Can my post get me in trouble at work?	"When you read it's ""Time to BeReal!"" on your phone, the expectations are clear. You open the app, take a picture of yourself and whatever's in front of you. 
It could be the meal you've just cooked, the TV show you're watching, or your computer screen at work. 
But as the app grows in popularity, do we need to be more careful what we post when we're on shift?
Or is zooming in on your friend's work computer just innocent fun?
was released in 2020, but started to get much more popular in mid-2022. Some reports say BeReal has had more than 27 million downloads worldwide. 
If you're not familiar with it, it's a social media platform that notifies all users simultaneously at a random time every day. It gives you just two minutes to stop and take a picture of your surroundings.
kes you off-guard, forcing you to be more ""real"" than you might be when curating, for example, an Instagram story. 
Once you've posted, you can scroll through all of your friends' posts and see what they're up to. 
Most users will admit they've enjoyed zooming in to their friends' screen to see the way they type on email, or what task they're up to.
But talk has since turned to whether that's allowed - with people flagging data protection and privacy concerns.
It's ""definitely a bad idea"" to take a BeReal of your work screen, says Emma Green, a data protection expert and managing partner at Cyber Data Law Solicitors.
She says there are a number of factors to consider.
""Firstly, you will more than likely be breaking data protection laws if there's any personal data on those screens.""
's any information linked to a person that makes them identifiable.
So yes, even getting someone's email address in the shot would technically be a breach of the law.
More importantly, Emma stresses that taking any photo of your workplace screen is very likely to be a breach of company rules.
""Probably in your employment contract, there will be a duty of confidentiality as an employee not to disclose confidential information about the company that may well be on those screens and even in the office in the background,"" she says.
Even though you can choose who to be friends with on the BeReal app, Emma says once something is posted you can never be sure who will see it. Screenshots could be taken, or phones passed around among friends. 
""Especially if people are zooming in and reading emails, you may well be in breach of contract,"" she says.
""It could lead to disciplinaries, and so you could find yourself in a lot of trouble with your employer.""
You might be thinking this advice is dramatic, and be tempted to snap that photo next time your BeReal alert goes off.
But Emma's key advice is that the post isn't worth the hassle it might cause. 
Even if it's meant to be an innocent picture, shared among friends, if it ends up further than that you could be in trouble. 
""'I wasn't aware' or 'I didn't realise' is not a defence, unfortunately,"" Emma says.

Analysis by Nikhil Inamdar, India Business Correspondent
Foreign auto makers have found it difficult to succeed in India. Ford's exit is just the latest in a series of departures. 
Companies like General Motors, Volkswagen-owned MAN Trucks and even iconic motorbike maker Harley Davidson have been among the firms that have stopped manufacturing in India in recent years. 
Earlier this year, Japanese motor industry giant Nissan decided to pull its small car brand Datsun out of the country because of poor sales.
While GM and Harley Davidson have said these decisions were part of their global strategic shift from certain markets, analysts also point to lacklustre revenues and lack of economies of scale in India.
India is still seen as a car market with great potential but sales have plunged to a decade low due to a slowdown in economic growth, weak labour markets, higher fuel prices and pandemic-related disruptions.
untry's passenger vehicle market has stagnated for the last half a decade at around 3 million units a year. 
In China, on the other hand, more than 20 million cars are bought annually.
But some Indian car makers have seen demand rise. One of Tata's rivals Mahindra and Mahindra said on Friday that demand for its vehicles was outstripping production as people rushed to buy its popular sport-utility vehicles.

Mr Monk said: ""To the best of our knowledge it is the first time a Cornish language poster has been used for a distributed feature film.
""It gives the sense that the language was the language of the island and it's nice to highlight this aspect of the film.
""The Cornish language is also thriving, the number of people speaking it is growing all the time and it's started to break into mainstream culture.

technology	Music industry as tough as it has always been, watchdog says	"UK's competition watchdog has found streaming has made the music industry challenging for many artists. 
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said more than 80% of recorded music was now listened to via streaming, with more than 138 billion streams in the UK last year.
MPs had demanded a ""complete reset"" of the industry, amid ""pitiful returns"" for artists.
for the CMA to look into the power of the major players.
Although the primary focus of the report was on consumers, the watchdog found a small number of high-profile artists enjoyed most of the financial success while the majority made no substantial earnings.
CMA interim chief executive Sarah Cardell said: ""For many artists, it is just as tough as it has always been - and many feel that they are not getting a fair deal.""
But the report notes streaming has made it easier not only for listeners to access music but also for artists to record and share it.
report addresses the claim most artists are paid far too little for music streams and the business model benefits only big labels and star acts.
A million streams per month would earn an artist only about Â£12,000 per year, it says.
Spotify is believed to pay between Â£0.002 and Â£0.0038 per stream, Apple Music about Â£0.0059. 
YouTube pays the least - about Â£0.00052 (0.05p).
Catherine Willcox, of UK country-music duo Ward Thomas, told BBC News: ""Having been in the industry for more than a decade and achieving relative success - a number-one album, sold-out tours and many exciting festival spots - it may appear from the outside that we would be fairly comfortable financially.
""However, with the decline in album sales across the board and the rise in streaming, no-one is fully sure how they will sustain a creative career as the landscape of the industry changes so dramatically.""
CMA noted every artist was competing harder than ever before for each of these streams - both with new artists and, in the form of the back catalogue, all the music ever made.
""We are incredibly lucky to be able to do this full time for the moment,"" Wilcox said, ""but it is always very tenuous - and this is coming from two artists who profit from the masters, the performance rights and live shows. 
""This is even more difficult for songwriters who only get their writer's cut.""
More artists than ever before are releasing music, the report says, but this does not mean more are successful.
Analysis published by the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) shows the number reaching one million UK streams per month remains low,  about 1,700.
""Some of the best songwriters we know have had to secure other sources of income and so can't dedicate the proper time needed to their craft,"" Wilcox said.
""The best songs are yet to be written - but if they aren't being fairly compensated, too many very talented people will be forced to quit."" 
report found streaming was now the primary means for artists and labels to distribute music and the public were embracing it.
Some of the other key findings include:
A number of groups had called for a full market investigation by the CMA - and more solutions to support singers and songwriters. 
But the watchdog rejected this because ""our initial findings have not identified any significant concerns in terms of consumer outcomes relating to music streaming"".
#BrokenRecord campaign was one of those groups - started by Gomez member Tom Gray at the beginning of lockdown, after artists lost touring income. 
He told BBC News: ""A serious concern is the mantra that things have always been this difficult. 
""Indeed 'just as tough as' suggests things may have been worse - but we can see no evidence for such an assertion. 
""The IPO carried out a report into creator earnings last year and could not find data to say where things were in the past, so it feels fairly groundless.
""Creators find it harder now to make income from recorded music than ever before.""
Listeners now have access to a huge choice of music for a fixed monthly subscription fee - and these have fallen in real terms. 
But Mr Gray said this was bad for artists.
""Rhapsody, the first streaming service cost $9.99 in 2001,"" he said.
""Streaming costs the same 21 years later. 
""Obviously, that is a good deal for consumers - but is it destructive to the value of music itself? 
""The answer ought to be, 'Yes.'""
CMA also touched on the ""strong concern"" from some artists labels gave insufficient information about their how their earnings were calculated. 
Mr Gray said: ""Whilst music has always been precarious, the pro-rata system is significantly more 'winner takes all' than anything we've seen before.""
CMA said the market was delivering good outcomes for customers but it would be concerned if:
Association of Independent Music chief executive Paul Pacifico said: ""We welcome the CMA's update report, which reinforces what we know - that building success in music is hard - and underlines the need for organisations across music to work together to secure positive outcomes for the sector.""
British Phonographic Industry chief executive Geoff Taylor also welcomed the findings and said: ""We will continue to engage with the CMA and government to help ensure that the streaming market works to the benefit of artists, songwriters, record companies and fans.""
Ms Cardell said: ""Our initial analysis shows that the outcomes for artists are not driven by issues to do with competition, such as sustained excessive profits.
""We are now keen to hear views on our initial findings, which will help guide our thinking and inform our final report.""
Musicians' Union general secretary Naomi Pohl said it was ""disappointing"" the ""competition issues"" in the streaming market ""will not be explored fully by a CMA investigation"".
""The CMA's release today highlights what it sees as positive impacts of music streaming - but we feel they have failed to recognise the very serious problems posed to creators,"" she said."	/news/technology-62305395
politics	Bird flu: Wales holds off on tighter rules	"Wales has said it is not following England in demanding poultry and captive birds are kept indoors to tackle avian flu.
using order will come into force from 7 November.
Having looked at available scientific evidence the Welsh government said it was not making a similar decision ""at this time"".
urkey farmers have warned of a shortage this Christmas caused by the UK's largest-ever bird flu outbreak.
Wales had been a part of the last UK-wide housing order, which was imposed in November and lifted in May.
Strict biosecurity measures have already been imposed across Great Britain in response to try to control the outbreak.
In October cases of bird flu were found near Amlwch and near Dwyran, both on Anglesey.
Chief Veterinary Officer for England Christine Middlemiss said the country is facing the ""largest ever outbreak of bird flu"".
She said it was seeing a ""rapid escalation in the number of cases on commercial farms and in backyard birds across England"".
Agricultural and rural affairs policy in Wales is controlled by the Welsh government in Cardiff.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""Having analysed the available scientific evidence, we are not introducing mandatory housing of poultry in Wales at this time.Â 
""We will continue to monitor the situation in Wales.Â All keepers must keep their birds safe by rigorously applying the biosecurity measures in the Wales Avian Influenza Prevention Zone, andÂ be vigilant for signs of the disease."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63462670
politics	Lib Dems urge ministers to ban home repossessions over Christmas	"Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called on the government to ban banks from repossessing people's homes over the holiday period.
usands of families are facing a ""nightmare before Christmas"" as mortgage rates soar, warned Sir Ed.
He is also demanding immediate action to protect private renters from eviction in England.
government said it had met with lenders to ensure they support mortgage holders in financial difficulty.
Lib Dem proposals include a temporary ban on home repossession, between now and 31 December, along similar lines to a ban that was in place during the pandemic.
re also calling for a new Mortgage Protection Fund, which would provide temporary grants to those most at risk of repossession.
Sir Ed said: ""The Conservative government put hundreds of pounds on people's mortgages through their disastrous mini-budget. The very least they could now do is to take responsibility for fixing this mess and protecting homeowners on the brink.""
He added: ""No-one should face losing their home this Christmas because the Conservative government crashed the economy.""
government figures show mortgage possession claims in the courts reached 3,680 between July and September, a 30% increase on the same period last year, although they are still lower than before the pandemic.
Rates on new fixed-rate mortgage deals have climbed throughout this year, as the Bank of England put up interest rates to curb rising prices. 
But they shot up following then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's ill-fated mini-budget in September.
, and fell back slightly in the aftermath of his successor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement.
Anyone taking out a new mortgage is still likely to pay a much higher rate than on their previous deal. 
Under the Lib Dem proposals, anyone who sees their mortgage payments rise by more than 10% of their household income would get a grant to cover the cost of that rise for the next year, up to a maximum of Â£300 a month.
rty is also calling for an increase in housing benefit - and for the government to pass much-delayed legislation to ban Section 21 no-fault evictions, where private landlords can evict tenants without giving a reason.
Sir Ed urged the government to pass legislation before the Christmas recess to enact the ban on no-fault evictions. 
A government spokesman said: ""We are protecting vulnerable families from homelessness this winter with an extra Â£50m to prevent evictions and secure new places for people to live.""
He said cost-of-living payments were also being provided to the most vulnerable households, in addition to support with energy bills. 
""Ensuring a fair deal for renters remains a priority for the government, that's why we will deliver on our commitment to abolish Section 21 'no-fault' evictions,"" he added."	/news/uk-politics-63957970

health	Nurses in Scotland vote for strike action in pay dispute	"Scotland's largest nursing union has voted to go on strike for the first time ever in a dispute over pay.
Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) have rejected the Scottish government's revised pay offer. 
union said every service in Scotland had supported industrial action, and called on ministers to return to the negotiating table.
government said there was no more money for public sector pay rises and that a strike would be ""catastrophic"".
Action is expected to start by the end of the year after RCN members across the UK voted to strike.
most recent Scottish government pay offer was for a flat rate of Â£2,205 per person, backdated to April.
union has described the deal as a real-terms pay cut and accused the government of not listening to staff concerns. It asked for at least 5% above inflation, which rose to 10.1% in September.
RCN's Scotland director, Colin Poolman, said turnout had reached 70% in some of the organisations which had been balloted, and that more than 90% of members had voting in favour of strike action in most areas.
He said ""life-preserving services"" would still be in place despite the industrial action.
Mr Poolman said he hoped the Scottish government would return to negotiations with an improved offer.
""If we don't do something now, the nursing crisis is only going to get worse and have a direct impact on patient care,"" he said.
""This is not just about nursing pay, this is about supporting patients and ensuring that we have a sustainable workforce going forward.""
Last month, members staged a protest outside the Scottish Parliament after the union confirmed it was balloting all 300,000 UK members for the first time in its 106-year history.
Last week about 2,500 workers in the Unite union voted for industrial action.
Members of the GMB union and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy have also backed strike action.
But Unison, Scotland's largest health union, has suspended its strike ballot of NHS staff and is consulting its members on a revised pay offer until 14 November.
When you talk to nurses who have been juggling shifts for 20 years or who moved out of their homes during the pandemic, there is a real sense of exhaustion and low morale.
Again and again staff talk about earning more in a supermarket or an office where there are more regular hours and less demands. 
It's perhaps no surprise then that there has been such support for strike action in every part of Scotland, with the RCN saying the future of the profession is at risk without better rewards.
Other unions that represent staff like paramedics, midwives or physiotherapists also stand ready to strike. However, the biggest healthcare union, Unison - which represents domestic staff through to senior nurses - has pulled its strike ballot, preferring to let members decide whether to accept the government's pay offer. 
re is still time for negotiations to continue, but in the meantime discussions will take place between unions and health boards to work out which services are critical to patient safety.
It means some staff who may have voted in favour of industrial action but who work in A&E or intensive care will still be asked to cover shifts.
ffer in Scotland would mean an average salary increase of 7%, with the lowest paid gaining more than 11% and qualified nursing staff receiving up to 8.45%. 
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf described the offer as ""the largest of its kind since devolution"".
He said he was disappointed with the decision to strike but respected the RCN's mandate.
Mr Yousaf said the health service was already under significant pressures, which were likely to increase over the winter.
""So of course a strike would be catastrophic, I don't think anyone can say otherwise,"" he said.
Mr Yousaf said he hoped to continue dialogue with the unions to avert industrial action.
""Nobody wants a strike to take place in a health service that is already extremely stretched and in the midst of winter,"" he added.
He added that the UK government should ""put its hand in its pocket"" to provide more funding for such pay deals, saying: ""I don't have any more money.""
Unions have called for an enhanced deal that reflects the pressures facing households due to the cost of living crisis, which has been caused by rising energy bills and soaring food prices.
In England and Wales, NHS staff, including nurses, have been offered an average of 4.75% more, with extra for the lowest paid.
Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland, nurses are yet to receive a pay award.
Dr John Harden, the Scottish government's deputy national clinical director, is a consultant in emergency medicine at Wishaw General Hospital.
He said NHS Lanarkshire had shifted to ""code black"", where the focus on patient safety and prioritising treating the sickest patients. 
He said staff were struggling to find space for new patients arriving in the emergency department.
He said the hospital was ""pretty close"" to the tipping point, and that some colleagues had reached their limit with the working conditions in the hospital.
""I think unfortunately some people might find it too much. I know some colleagues who have and I'm not surprised,"" he said. 
""The reason they do end up in that situation is because they care and they find it very difficult to manage the balance of their caring and compassion being stretched to the limit."""	/news/uk-scotland-63558472
health	Lioness Demi Stokes opens up about her crazy entrance into the world	"Lioness Demi Stokes who was born 10 weeks early weighing 3lb (1.3kg) has shared her birth story to show premature babies are strong.
Manchester City and England star said she had a ""crazy entrance into the world"" after being born in a toilet.
30-year-old footballer has opened up to mark World Prematurity Day.
""I probably was quite small when I started playing football, but it just meant I had to work a little bit harder,"" she said.
""And actually, once I did fill out, I probably overtook the bigger guys,"" said Stokes, who joined Sunderland's youth academy aged eight and by 16 was playing in the first team.
""I think that's what I'd say to other parents now - don't worry if they're small and if they might be a bit late to develop, because we catch up. 
""We need to let little premmie babies know they are strong and... very robust.""
Stokes and her partner Katie Harrington have a six-month-old son, Harlen, who was born six weeks early weighing 5lbs (2.3kg).
He needed to spend a week in hospital after being born via emergency Caesarean.
She said it was only since becoming a parent it had sunk in what an anxious time it must have been for her own mum.
""But it's interesting because when I do speak to my mum about it, she doesn't ever say, 'Oh, it was horrendous'... I feel like she must have blocked it out.""
She said she had two other siblings who were also premature and while they were healthy, ""everyone's experience isn't the same"".
Stokes said she had shared her story to help start conversations around what experiencing a premature or difficult birth could be like for those going through it.
""It's important we talk about it,"" she said. 
Her partner also had pre-eclampsia, which she became seriously unwell with.
""It was really scary... I remember thinking, 'Demi, just have a poker face' - because if I crumble, I'm not going to help Katie,"" she said. 
She believed the skills she learned as a footballer, in terms of mental focus and staying calm under pressure, helped in the moment. 
""But inside, I was panicking and I was worried, definitely,"" she shared. ""I think not until after, when she came home, then I was like, 'You were really poorly, you were really unwell'.""
Stokes added that both were doing well now - and despite being ""a little early"", Harlen's ""really filled out and thriving"".

technology	Heatwave forced Google and Oracle to shut down computers	"As record temperatures hit much of the UK on Tuesday, tech giants Google and Oracle suffered outages as cooling systems failed at London data centres. 
Data centres are large highly secure buildings that hold banks of computers and are the powerhouses behind many online services.
But the concentrated computing power generates heat so powerful that cooling is essential.
Both companies say the problems have now been resolved.
Oracle, a large American database software and technology business, reported overheating problems just before 16:00 BST.
""Following unseasonably high temperatures in the UK south (London) region, two cooler units in the data centre experienced a failure when they were required to operate above their design limits,"" the company wrote on a status page first spotted by The Register.
""As a result, temperatures in the data centre began to climb, which caused some systems to shut down as a protective measure.""
mpany said the issue was resolved, in an update posted shortly after 10:00 BST on Wednesday.
As Britain baked, overheating also hit a Google Cloud data centre location in London.
Google Cloud lets other businesses do work on the company's computers.
Just after 18:00 BST, the company reported that ""there has been a cooling-related failure in one of our buildings"". 
In order to prevent damage to machines and an extended outage, the firm said it powered down some of them.
roblem was fixed by 07:00 BST on Wednesday and the company said that only a ""small set of our customers"" were affected.
Because the data processed can be highly valuable to their customers, data centres are built with many back-ups, including plenty of cooling capacity.
Experts the BBC spoke to on Monday doubted that modern data centres would experience difficulties, so the failures at big, well-resourced, companies like Google will have come as a surprise.
But operators were wary of the unprecedented temperatures.
Paul Hone, of Redcentric, which operates data centres in Harrogate, London, Reading and Cambridge, told the BBC that the firm had put its disaster recovery plan into action on Monday. 
Mr Hone added that while data centres are designed to withstand hot weather, the heatwave's temperatures would be at the ""upper end of design expectations for a lot of data centre operators"".
In the end, for Mr Hone, Tuesday passed without incident.
But additional cooling means additional electricity consumption, which in turn can mean increased carbon emissions. 
With climate scientists warning that very hot days will become more frequent, tech firms are exploring greener cooling solutions and computer systems that consume less power and generate less heat.
Microsoft carried out an experiment with an underwater data centre off Orkney in 2020. Part of the attraction was the natural cooling provided by the surrounding seawater."	/news/technology-62202125
entertainment	Harry and Meghan reveal Archie's favourite song in Netflix documentary	"Home video of Archie features in Harry and Meghan documentary
Archie Mountbatten-Windsor may be only three, but he has already decided upon a favourite song, his doting parents have revealed in their new Netflix documentary
Luckily for Harry and Meghan, the song happens to be one by their close friend Elton John, Bennie And The Jets.
, sixth in line to the throne, is also heard to speak, describing a red sky as ""beautiful"".
uple have been careful to control media access to their two children.
Archie and Lilibet have been largely kept out of the public eye since they were born in 2019 and 2021 respectively.
However, Archie has already appeared in a number of outlets - albeit rarely showing his face. Notably, his voice had previously been heard on Meghan's podcast, and - more recently - he featured in an August interview his mother did with US magazine The Cut. 
Prince Harry spoke about their choices as part of the documentary, Harry & Meghan, which was released on Netflix on Thursday morning, UK time.
""As a dad, and as parents, I think consent is a really key piece to this,"" he tells the cameras. ""That if you have children it should be your consent as to what you share.""
Harry also reveals they are keen not to make ""the same mistakes that perhaps our parents did"" in raising their two children, with Meghan noting: ""There's so much from anyone's childhood that you bring with you into the present. Especially when you're the product of divorce.""
Harry - who also speaks of his pride in having mixed-race children - says he hopes that he will be able to give his children ""an answer"" if they ever turn to him and ask ""what did you do in this moment?"".
""I think it is such a responsibility as human beings that, if you bring a small person into this world, that you should be doing everything you can to make the world a better place for them,"" he says."	/news/uk-63901336
business	Business confidence is falling, says Natwest boss	"f living crisis presents challenges because so many firms and customers have no experience of high inflation and rising lending rates, NatWest boss Alison Rose has said.
Firms on the bank's books have falling confidence, she told BBC Scotland.
Ms Rose blamed this on problems with supply chains, energy bills and skills shortages.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also ""exacerbated"" people's worries, she added. 
ree years after she took over the top role from Ross McEwan, and renamed Royal Bank of Scotland, or RBS, with the Natwest brand, Ms Rose said that the impact of inflation, higher interest rates and the invasion of Ukraine has caused a ""concern"" for business about ""confidence to grow"". 
""We are still seeing positive tailwinds from recovery from the pandemic as companies scale back up again, but definitely business confidence is being affected,"" she said. 
She added business customers of Natwest are not pulling back on investment, though there is cautiousness about long-term projects. 
""We're seeing people increasing investment in working capital as they re-engineer their supply chains,"" Ms Rose said.
""One of the challenges we all need to recognise is that, for a lot of business owners and lot of families, an environment of inflation and rising interest rates is not something they've had to deal with for a long period of time.""
Interest rates were cut sharply during the financial crisis in 2008-09, when RBS had the biggest balance sheet of any bank in the world, ran into severe difficulties with its exposure to bad lending, and had to be bailed out with a Â£45bn capital injection by the UK government. 
It is only this month that the Bank of England base interest rate has returned to 1%, and the current Consumer Price Index, at 9%, is at its highest level for 40 years and continuing to rise. 
So it is a falling minority of people in Britain who remember the problems of living with high inflation, and few in business could remember both rising at the same time.
Ms Rose, who joined Natwest 30 years ago, said the bank has relationship managers who can offer experience of getting through turmoil in business conditions.
""People are really anxious and worried about all those trends, so we encourage them to come and talk to us, because there are things we can do and we can help with,"" she explained.
f executive said the bank is not seeing signs of mortgage arrears rising or bad debt more widely.
""As we came out of the pandemic, a lot of businesses built a lot of liquidity on their balance sheet. One of the things we've focussed on is helping people save and put money away for a rainy day. 
""We're not seeing any of those early warning indicators around bad debts or insolvencies or even calls coming into our financial health and support teams.
""But we're very acutely aware that people are worried about those challenges. We encourage customers to get in touch if they are worried.""
finance sector has seen pay rise ahead of inflation, unlike almost every other sector. RBS bonuses this year were up 44%. 
While others face falling real incomes, the Natwest boss defended bank pay as fair and competitive with other banks, while the bonus pool is declining.
""We recognise that we get well paid in the finance sector, but the majority of our staff don't get bonuses. The majority are on fixed pay,"" she said.
""We've always said we would pay fairly and competitively. Our staff are paid above minimum wage. Also it's important to bring the right talent into our organisation so that we can support our customers.""
On very low savings rates for customers of Natwest and Royal Bank of Scotland and its Ulster Bank brand - only 0.15% on the premium saver account and 0.45% on ISA cash - the chief executive responded: ""We've got to balance all those elements. We've always said we will pass on rates, to keep that in balance to make sure we're doing that responsibly and fairly.""
Also in the interview, looking back at her time in the investment bank, while its operations were close to bringing Royal Bank of Scotland crashing down in 2008, Ms Rose recalled it as a ""really difficult time"".
""I've had my whole career here, and I remember the financial crisis clearly, and the impact we can have on people's lives when things go wrong. That's driven a huge part of my commitment to rebuilding part of the bank's reputation,"" she said.
""I remember walking the floors, talking to more junior people, trying to provide reassurance. What I saw was a lot of my colleagues - good people, doing good work, traumatised by what happened, (feeling) it wasn't the bank they recognised. That wasn't what they did.""
She reflects that the last two chief executives - Mr McEwan and Stephen Hester - were in a fight for survival, whereas her job is about focussing on the future and growth, about building relationships more than being a bank purely for transactions.
And on the move away from its Scottish branding, she said Natwest remains proud of its Scottish heritage, banking one in three Scottish businesses, one in five households and one in seven Scottish mortgages, while being a major employer north of the border."	/news/business-61599029

entertainment	Girls Aloud: It's 20 years since pop greats were born on Popstars The Rivals	"Cast your mind back to 2002. The country was celebrating the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, the Commonwealth Games were held in Manchester, and Davina McCall was live on ITV1 with some important news. 
""Here is the line-up that you have chosen for your girl band,"" she told viewers of Popstars: The Rivals.
It was 30 November, and a band was about to be formed on reality TV.
group would be called Girls Aloud, and the public decided it wanted Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Kimberley Walsh and Sarah Harding to fill the gap in the music industry left by the Spice Girls, and ""to take on the boys"" - One True Voice.
It was a simple TV talent show concept: wannabe singers hoping to be part of two rival groups (the boys and the girls), with judges whittling auditionees down to 10 contenders for each group before letting the public eliminate a performer each Saturday until there were two bands of five left battling it out for 2002's Christmas number one.
""Sound of the Underground was a life changing song for myself and Girls Aloud,"" Kimberley tells BBC News. ""We knew we had hit gold when we heard it for the first time.""
What the public didn't know then: it had chosen five women who would break the pop mould and score more hit singles than any other girl group in UK chart history.
mark the 20th anniversary of their debut, Sound of the Underground, the group are releasing it on vinyl, along with an alternative vocal arrangement. The profits will be donated to The Sarah Harding Breast Cancer appeal - in memory of the 39-year-old band member who died from the disease last year.
In a 2002 review, the BBC claimed the song promised ""a pleasantly surprising antidote to all the worst post-office party hangovers, with enough oomph to blow those cobwebs away"".
""It's amazing, it was our first single 20 years ago and it's still one of our most popular, and most played songs,"" Kimberley says.
""We're all very proud of it and it means a great deal to us.""
For years, Saturday morning children's TV was dominated by the band as they performed hit after infectious hit - like No Good Advice, Wake Me Up, Biology and Something Kinda Ooooh. 
But it was an unlikely choice by the Arctic Monkeys, four days before their debut album was released, to cover the group's single Love Machine in 2006 that brought a whole new audience to Girls Aloud.
""It captured everybody's imagination,"" Jo Whiley, who hosted BBC Radio 1's morning slot at the time, said in 2018. ""Listen up for Alex's laugh. It's my favourite moment in any Live Lounge.""
Frontman Alex Turner told the BBC last month he couldn't remember how it came about - but the two genres of music could be closer than you think. Xenomania, the producers who worked on most of Girls Aloud's hits, told the BBC last year ""pop music was on its knees"" in the early '00's, but the group became ""part of why the world sounds the way it is now"".
Music promoter Luke Joynes put forward the case that Girls Aloud should be celebrated as a guitar band in this comprehensive Twitter thread.
""Pop groups like Girls Aloud paved the way for guitar sounds to be more mainstream back then,"" Joynes believes. ""The more you listen to them, the more you realise how different they sounded to newer girl groups like Little Mix and Fifth Harmony.""
Girls Aloud blurred the lines of what was cool and what pop music should sound like. Nobody would have thought Coldplay would invite some reality show winners to support them on tour. But, along with Jay-Z, Girls Aloud got the crowd in the mood at Wembley Stadium in 2009, with Chris Martin declaring they were ""the ultimate form of life"".
Away from the riffs, lyrics and choreography, there was something about the group that simply represented the mid-noughties in pop, when everything was a bit freer: an era of polyphonic ringtones, charity bracelets and gel pens.
E4 series Girls Aloud: Off The Record followed the band around the UK and in Australia. In the age of cancel culture, it's now hard to imagine any chart-topping act daring to let cameras film as they argued with wardrobe staff, dealt with hangovers and complained about the lack of industry recognition. 
It's one of the reasons clips from the fly-on-the-wall series do so well on TikTok now. People aren't used to pop stars being so honest. Chunks of the documentary are also used in the Gals Aloud drag show.
""They really formed and shaped me to be the artist I am today,"" Drag Race star Cheryl Hole says. ""For a lot of us, Girls Aloud will never not be a thing in our lives. It's the soundtrack to our childhood and I will make sure the next generation know all the choreography to The Promise.""
Seeing Gals Aloud is likely to be the closest a fan can get to seeing the Biology, Can't Speak French and Untouchable singers on stage, because the band split in 2013. 
A 20th anniversary tour was in the works but, following Sarah's death last year, the other four members have made clear they don't feel comfortable performing without her. Instead, they have been hosting events to raise money for cancer treatment, including a Race For Life this summer.
Last year, Little Mix thanked Girls Aloud (as well as the Spice Girls, All Saints and Sugababes) when they became the first all-female act to win best British group at the Brit Awards.
It was something Nicola, Nadine, Kimberley, Cheryl and Sarah had been nominated for twice, losing out to Arctic Monkeys and Elbow.
Instead, Girls Aloud again relied on a public vote to finally claim a Brit in 2009 - winning best British single for The Promise. Having always lost out on categories judged by music insiders, the result reinforced that this was a group the British public not only created, but wanted to succeed. 
Last week I re-watched Popstars: The Rivals and, aside from the minimal production, some off-key performances and dated comments that made me squirm, there was one moment of innocence that stood out. 
Kimberley, then 21, looked into the camera, hoping to get in to the final band but unsure of what was to come: ""I think about how it's going to be, but I don't think any of us really know.""
wenty years on, she tells BBC News: ""It's been an incredibly reflective year for us, for obvious reasons, and it still blows my mind how much support we have from the public, and how much love is still out there for our music.""
On the day Sound of the Underground was released, BBC News reported: ""Over two-thirds of this year's number ones have been from acts hand-picked and groomed for stardom by record company talent spotters, or from TV pop contests. Many are convinced the current fad isn't going to create long-term acts with back catalogues.""
More than 20 singles, five studio albums, two greatest hits compilations and a collection of B-sides that can't be matched later, Girls Aloud really did prove everyone wrong."	/news/entertainment-arts-63570796

While it did not provide a figure, the Wall Street Journal quoted $300m.
would make it one of the biggest deals of its kind, putting Collins and Genesis behind only Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen.
wo rock legends have sold their catalogues in recent deals worth between $400m and $500m. Neil Young also earned $150m by selling a 50% share in his music in 2021.
Stars selling their catalogues has become a major music industry trend in recent years, with artists including Blondie, Shakira, Mark Ronson, Chic, Tina Turner and The Killers also handing over control of their songs in exchange for large lump sums.
For them, the deals provide immediate financial security, while ensuring their music does not fall into complicated litigation after they die. 
In return, investors - who range from record labels to hedge funds - make money from all future royalties generated by sales, streams and licensing deals.
Originally fronted by Peter Gabriel, Genesis were formed in 1969 and became leading lights of the progressive rock scene.

Concord's deal does not cover contributions from Gabriel and another former member, Steve Hackett, but includes top 10 hits like Invisible Touch, Mama, That's All and Abacab.
Collins' solo catalogue had previously been shopped around for a sum in the region of $200m, according to trade publication Billboard.

Collins' run of hit singles from the 1980s and 90s - including tracks like In Against All Odds, Sussudio and Another Day In Paradise - are likely to be the most attractive element of the deal.
His most popular track on Spotify, 1981's In The Air Tonight, has been played more than 500 million times, while Genesis's most-streamed song, Invisible Touch, has about 170 million plays.
Concord President Bob Valentine said the company would introduce the songs to a new generation of fans.

politics	Westminster to keep Welsh police and justice powers under Labour plans	"A new report on how Britain could look under a Labour UK government has stopped short of backing First Minister Mark Drakeford's calls for Wales' justice system to be run from Cardiff.
report by a commission led by ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown recommended abolishing the House of Lords.
But it failed to support the devolution of policing, prisons and adult courts.
Launching the report, leader Sir Keir Starmer promised the ""biggest ever transfer of power from Westminster"".
Mr Drakeford's Labour Welsh government has supported the devolution of justice powers for years.
Instead, the commission on the future of the UK recommended youth justice and probation be handed to ministers in Cardiff.
It says ""new powers should be made available to the Senedd and Welsh government"" but makes few specific recommendations.
Plaid Cymru called the findings a ""damp squib"", while Welsh Conservatives said there was no public appetite for further devolution.
Other recommendations say Welsh devolution should be constitutionally protected, in part through the replacement for the House of Lords, which would be called the Assembly of Nations and Regions.
Devolution is the process through which Welsh institutions have gained powers over areas like the health service and education since the creation of the assembly in 1999.
Mr Brown's report said there was no ""constitutional reason why matters which are devolved in Scotland... could not also be devolved in Wales"".
But the report suggested that the ability of Welsh institutions to handle new powers in Wales could be a reason not to go further.
It said devolution should be ""constrained only by reserving those matters which are necessary to discharge the purposes of the UK as a union, and in practice by the wishes of the Senedd itself... and of course by the practical challenges of transferring new powers and building the capability to operate them"".
Welsh government has claimed it could cut the number of people in prison if it controlled the country's justice system.
""Many in Wales seek the devolution of such powers,"" the report said.
""We understand this aspiration, and believe the next UK Labour government should embark upon the devolution of youth justice and the probation service.""
Justice powers are devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Meanwhile the report says the Sewel convention - the voluntary system by which Westminster seeks the approval of the Senedd for laws that cover devolved issues - would be made ""legally binding"".
It also said Members of the Senedd (MSs) should enjoy the same privileges and protections, if they want them, as Members of Parliament (MPs) over the statements they make in their proceedings.
report also suggested allowing the Scottish government to enter into international agreements involving Scottish areas, and giving councils fiscal powers to raise revenue.
Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said the report ""backtracks from previous Labour promises - the 2017 Labour manifesto having promised the devolution of policing to Wales"". 
""This report is a damp squib for Wales,"" she said, adding: ""The Labour Welsh government's Thomas Commission recommended that justice should be wholly devolved, and a Welsh legal jurisdiction created. 
""This timid report only offers piecemeal powers over youth justice and probation, showing the level of disdain the central Labour party holds towards the only government it currently runs.""
Welsh Conservative shadow minister for the constitution Darren Millar said: ""There is no great public appetite in Wales for further powers to be devolved to the Senedd. 
""Wales already has the powers it needs to deliver a better economy, better schools and better hospitals, but sadly the Labour Party has spectacularly failed to use them to achieve those aims.
""Instead of its obsession with constitutional tinkering, the Labour Party should be using the existing powers it has to improve the lives of the people of Wales.""
Former First Minister Carwyn Jones and former Welsh Secretary Paul Murphy were among those on the commission.
Mr Drakeford said: ""Labour is the party of devolution and this report shows that only Labour is thinking urgently about the future of the United Kingdom. 
""This report puts forward important ideas about how power can be devolved and shared throughout the country to create a stronger union,"" he added.
Welsh law expert Prof Emyr Lewis from Aberystwyth University said the proposals had an ""obvious omission here when it comes to the question of finance"".
""There's no reference in the report to ensure fair and binding rules on distributing money across the UK,"" he told BBC Radio Cymru.
Mark Drakeford may have welcomed this report, but its recommendations for Wales are a far cry from his published thinking about the future of Wales within the UK.
He has previously supported calls for ""radical federalism"" based on the idea that ""the UK is a voluntary association of four nations"".
His government wants to take over the running of the justice system in Wales. The Brown report says it ""understands the aspiration"", but instead it recommends handing the Welsh government power over probation and youth justice only.
Welsh Labour sources stress that this report is more about the UK as a whole than Wales in particular, but it does illustrate the differences that exist within Labour on the speed and extent of further constitutional change. 
Welsh government has established a separate commission to look at Wales' constitutional future, which publishes its interim report on Wednesday. I'm also told Gordon Brown was wary of intruding into its remit."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63860673
business	Employment rate for women in Scotland reaches record high	"mployment rate for women of working age in Scotland is at a record high, according to official figures.
Â OfficeÂ forÂ NationalÂ StatisticsÂ (ONS) reported that 75.6% of women aged between 16 and 64 were in work between August and October.
ghest rate recorded since the labour force survey began in 1992.
Scotland's employment rate for all people of working age rose by 0.7% from the previous three months, to match its highest ever level of almost 76%.
HoweverÂ unemploymentÂ inÂ ScotlandÂ increasedÂ slightly.
figures, released on Tuesday, showed that the number of people unavailable for work fell to 21.4%. 
And while there was a slight increase from early in the summer in the rate of unemployment, it remained at a very low level. The figure of 3.3% was below the UK jobless rate of 3.7%. 
ONS figures also showed that the pay of employed people across the UK rose by 6.1% on average over the year to October.
However, the effect of inflation meant that real spending power fell by 2.7%. 
Public sector workers saw an average fall in real earnings of 6.1%.
Scotland's employment minister, Richard Lochhead, said the employment rate had reached a joint record high, despite new GDP data showing a contraction in the economy during the third quarter.
Mr Lochhead said: ""This is against the backdrop of the serious challenges which businesses are facing from the cost crisis, high inflation, the continued impact of Brexit and the economic consequences of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.
""Through our Fair Work policy, we are supporting development of a labour market that is open and inclusive, while the ambitious National Strategy for Economic Transformation is helping deliver high-quality and sustainable jobs in the green economy.""
UK government's Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said Scotland's labour market had continued to ""demonstrate its resilience"".
He added: ""The UK government is committed to helping people find and progress in work, and to drive sustainable economic growth.
""The chancellor set out a number of measures in the Autumn Statement to put public finances on a secure footing and to promote economic growth - steps that are already making a positive contribution to tackling inflationary pressures."" "	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63954795
business	Ben & Jerry's criticises resumption of sales in Israeli settlements	"Ben & Jerry's has said it does ""not agree"" with a deal by its parent company Unilever that allows its ice cream to continue being sold in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
firm said it still believed it was ""inconsistent with Ben & Jerry's values for our ice cream to be sold in the Occupied Palestinian Territory"" - a position welcomed by many Palestinians.
Israel praised Unilever's reversal of last year's decision by Ben & Jerry's to stop such sales as a victory against discrimination and anti-Semitism.
Unilever's decision came after legal action from its Israeli licensee American Quality Products (AQP) and its owner Avi Zinger, who were seeking damages from the UK-based consumer goods giant. Their contract had been due to expire at the end of this year anyway.
re was also pressure against the withdrawal from shareholders, including activist investor Nelson Peltz, and politicians in the United States. 
Unilever said in a statement on Wednesday that it was now selling its Ben & Jerry's business interests in Israel to Mr Zinger.
w arrangement means Ben & Jerry's will be sold under its Hebrew and Arabic names throughout Israel and the West Bank under the full ownership of the current licensee.
Mr Zinger thanked Unilever and the Israeli government for their support in reaching a deal which he said gave him the rights to sell the ice cream ""forever"". But he refused to comment on Ben & Jerry's rejection of the arrangement.
In a statement, he said: ""There is no place for discrimination in the commercial sale of ice cream. It has always been important to me to ensure that all customers - no matter their identity - are free to enjoy Ben & Jerry's ice cream.""
Ben & Jerry's, which was founded by best friends Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield in the US state of Vermont in 1978, wrote in a Twitter thread: ""While our parent company has taken this decision, we do not agree with it."" 
""Our company will no longer profit from Ben & Jerry's in Israel,"" it added.
Ever since Unilever bought the ice cream company in 2000 it has retained an independent board with the right to make decisions about its social mission. The company has a history of speaking out about issues that it feels are important. 
However, Unilever still had control of financial and operational decisions and said that was why it had intervened after Ben & Jerry's board decided to stop sales in Israeli settlements.
More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.
Unilever said the new arrangement followed a review of Ben & Jerry's operations in Israel and an extensive consultation, including dialogue with the Israeli government.
When the row erupted last July Israel's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said a withdrawal would be bad business and morally wrong. Unilever owns several Israeli food brands, and in a phone call Mr Bennett warned its Chief Executive Alan Jope of ""severe consequences"". Ben & Jerry's is a popular ice cream choice amongst Israeli consumers, and the company even marks Jewish festivals with special flavours.
Palestinian activists behind the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement praised Ben & Jerry's at the time for what they said was ""a decisive step towards ending the company's complicity in Israel's occupation and violations of Palestinian rights"". The movement tries to use economic pressure to force Israel to change its policies.
However, Israel's government and Unilever continued talking and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid spoke to both Mr Jope and Mr Zinger in the last few days.
In a statement, Mr Lapid welcomed Unilever's efforts to resolve the dispute, saying: ""Anti-Semitism will not defeat us, not even when it comes to ice-cream. We will fight delegitimization and the BDS campaign in every arena, whether in the public square, in the economic sphere or in the moral realm. 
""The Ben & Jerry's factory in Israel is a microcosm of the diversity of Israeli society. Today's victory is a victory for all those who know that the struggle against BDS is, first and foremost, a struggle for partnership and dialogue, and against discrimination and hate."" 
At least 35 US states have anti-BDS legislation. Airbnb is amongst the other companies which have reversed their policies over Israeli settlements after facing lawsuits in the US.
Professor Eugene Kontorovich, director of International Law at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum, said Unilever's decision was ""a victory for the anti-boycott laws across America"". He added that, after the ""embarrassment and expense"" of this reversal, ""one would hope that companies will understand that it is just malpractice to boycott Israel"".
Omar Shakir of US-based campaign group Human Rights Watch said Unilever was seeking to undermine the ""principled decision"" of Ben & Jerry's board, but insisted it would not succeed.
""Ben & Jerry's won't be doing business in illegal settlements. What comes next may look and taste similar, but, without Ben & Jerry's recognized social justice values, it's just a pint of ice cream,"" he added.
Unilever has invested more than Â£240m ($290m) in Israel over the last decade and employs a diverse workforce of more than 2,000 people across four manufacturing plants.
""Unilever rejects completely and repudiates unequivocally any form of discrimination or intolerance,"" the company said.  
""Anti-Semitism has no place in any society. We have never expressed any support for the Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) movement and have no intention of changing that position."""	/news/business-61985652
business	Next rescues fashion chain Joules saving 1,450 jobs	"Clothing chain Joules has been rescued from administration by retail giant Next and founder Tom Joule.
Under the Â£34m deal, Next says it intends to keep about 100 Joules stores open and save 1,450 jobs.
However, 19 stores will be closed with immediate effect with the loss of 133 posts.
Joules, known for its premium, brightly-coloured clothes, collapsed into administration last month after failing to secure emergency investment.
Like other retailers, the Leicestershire-based firm has struggled against a backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic and cost-of-living pressures.
Under the terms of the deal, Next will take a 74% stake in the business, with Tom Joule owning the rest. Next has also paid Â£7m to buy the current Joules head office.
Next will continue to operate Joules' website but will also sell Joules-branded clothing through its own e-commerce platform from 2024.
f executive of Next, Lord Wolfson, said: ""We are excited to see what can be achieved through the combination of Joules' exceptional product, marketing and brand building skills with Next's Total Platform infrastructure.""
Warning that stores face a difficult Christmas
m Joule, who founded Joules in 1989, said the deal would protect the future of the company for its ""loyal customers, its employees and also for the town of Market Harborough, which have been so central to Joules' success"".
Mr Joule stepped back from designing Joules' products in 2019, but recently returned to be the company's product director.
Next said that after completion of the rescue deal, Mr Joule would ""take the lead in re-establishing the clear identity of both brand and product"".
good outcome for Joules. And it's the second business Next has bought out of administration in the space of about a month. 
Joules had been seen as a success story, valued at Â£140m when it floated on the stock exchange in 2016. Today though, after tough competition, Next snapped up most of it for Â£34m.  
Joules had lost its way. It spent Â£20m on a new head office less than a year ago and it also bought an online furniture accessories business, adding complexity and cost.  
Store closures are painful but this swift rescue deal means Joules will survive as a brand on the High Street as well as benefit from Next's online infrastructure to drive sales. 
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the deal was ""not without risk"" for Next.
''The deal with founder Tom Joules will see the distinctive wellies, coats and fleeces sold alongside its directory of other brands at a time when consumer spending power has taken a hit,"" she said.
""Although this is a tried and tested strategy with Reiss, Gap and Victoria Secret Secret also sold on the Total Platform [Next's e-commerce platform], with Next scooping up commissions on sales there are niggles of worry that this retail powerhouse could soon be biting off more than it can chew.""
""Next also has to devote attention to the effect of soaring inflation on its wider business, which is looming large over the group's customer base, and regardless of management's best efforts, it's likely to squeeze margins,"" she said.
Joules is the latest brand to be picked up by Next after getting into trouble.
Last month, Next bought furniture retailer Made.com's brand name, website and intellectual property after that company fell into administration.
In April, Next took a 44% stake in baby goods retailer JoJo Maman Bebe as part of a deal which saw the rest of the business acquired by a group of finance firms.
re are fears other retailers could struggle as the cost of living soars.
High Street giant Marks and Spencer has warned of a ""gathering storm"" of higher costs for businesses and pressure on household budgets, adding that ""all parts"" of retail will be affected."	/news/business-63807159
entertainment	The Lost King: Legal action 'likely' against Richard III film	"A university academic has said he is likely to take legal action against the makers of a new film about Richard III, which he said was ""littered with inaccuracies"".
Richard Taylor was part of the University of Leicester team that found and identified the king 10 years ago.
A character bearing his name features in the film The Lost King, starring Steve Coogan and Sally Hawkins.
But Mr Coogan has said: ""The university are responsible for their own undoing.""
film, released on Friday - which was also co-written by Mr Coogan - stars Oscar nominee and Golden Globe winning Ms Hawkins in the lead role of Philippa Langley, an ordinary woman who - it says - ""took on the country's most eminent historians, forcing them to think again"".
It tells the story of Ms Langley, whose quest to find the remains of the last Plantagenet monarch prompted his discovery in 2012.
In its promotional material, it said it was the ""remarkable, true story"" of the find.
But the university said claims its staff sidelined Ms Langley and took the credit for the find are ""far removed"" from the truth.
Mr Taylor, former deputy registrar at the university, told the BBC he had felt ""absolutely shell-shocked"" by the way he was portrayed.
He said: ""I think the film is inaccurate, and I think the writers have been very reckless in how they've put it together.
""Anybody who knows me knows my integrity is important to me.
""There are lots of people I have to work with who don't know me - what are they to think, seeing a film like that?""
Mr Taylor said the film-makers had not sought to speak to him at any point.
""The film is littered with inaccuracies,"" he said.
""It makes up a scene where I mimic Richard III's disability, and have to be told by Philippa that it's wrong to equate physical characteristics with evilness.
""That is the most hurtful personally and the most damaging reputationally. It is not true; it did not take place.
""I'd hoped my concerns would have chimed with Steve Coogan, who had his privacy invaded by newspapers over phone hacking.
""To see him on the other side of the fence now, doing this to me is quite frustrating. I feel kind of powerless in the way Steve would have felt.""
Mr Taylor said he had sought to engage with the producers to get changes - including the removal of one scene and a note added to the credits that the character is not based on him - but had been refused.
""I'm trying to be reasonable,"" he said.
""I've tried to offer a way to bring this to a conclusion where they make some small changes.
""I have sought to engage in good faith with the producers to gain changes, but have been refused. 
""Legal action is now likely.""
university - which said it funded the bulk of the excavations and subsequent research to identify the king's remains - said they were never consulted over their depiction by the film-makers.
""No University of Leicester staff were interviewed for the film,"" a spokesperson said.
""We offered to help the film-makers and were ignored and have the correspondence to prove it.""
In a statement, it added: ""We understand the portrayal of Richard Taylor in the film does not in any way resemble the reality during this period, whilst an employee of the University of Leicester.
""Our records point to a colleague engaging constructively, collegiately, fairly and professionally throughout the project.""
However, Mr Coogan has told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believed the university had ""played this quite badly"".
""Had they at the start been generous towards Philippa, and elevated her to the front and centre position, which is where she deserves to be, this film wouldn't have been necessary.
""But at every turn they marginalised her, edged her out, because she wasn't cut from the right cloth.""
Dan Winch, the film's producer, said the filmmakers had had contact with the university, despite the institution claiming otherwise.
""We did interviews. We subsequently had contact through the course of pre-production,"" he said.
""We don't want to sound desperately defensive. It just did happen.
""We were very courteous and respectful but we explained if we were to engage too far over the line then it wouldn't be the story we wanted to tell - that's Philippa's story.
""It wouldn't be the film we wanted to make.
""We couldn't be more proud of our film.""
Ms Langley said: ""It's not a documentary. It is a movie.
""I have had to fight to get my story told and the film does this.""
A spokesperson for the film-makers said: ""We stand by our film and Philippa's narrative.
""The university and Richard Taylor have a different narrative, much of which is factually incorrect.""

health	Three hospital inquiries launched after BBC Newsnight probe	"NHS has announced three major reviews of a hospital trust after a BBC Newsnight probe was told a climate of fear among staff put patients at risk.
Whistleblowers at University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Trust alleged they were punished by management for raising safety concerns.
One insider told the BBC the trust was ""a bit like the mafia"".
An independent party will oversee the first review of the trust, which said previously it took safety seriously. 
NHS Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board (ICB) said the first report was expected by the end of January.
ICB added the probes would address the allegations and look in depth at any broader leadership and cultural issues at the trust.
BBC Newsnight and BBC West Midlands heard a raft of staff concerns, including claims of a dangerous shortage of nurses and a lack of communication, leading, it was alleged, to some haematology patients dying without receiving treatment.
f 20 patients in the haematology department of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, run by the trust, led to a review in 2017 by consultant Emmanouil Nikolousis.
ICB has said the first investigation - by an ""experienced senior independent clinician from outside the local health system"" - will start immediately and focus on Mr Nikolousis' review.
It adds the trust is commissioning a broader external review of culture at UHB as well as an external review to be done in partnership with NHS England and NHS Birmingham and Solihull.
Patrick Vernon, interim chair of the ICB, said: ""As a system we must ensure that we are listening and responding to our patients and staff, and we will be relentless in a joint pursuit of improvement and positive transformation while recognising that NHS staff at this time are working through the most challenging period in their careers.""
He added: ""These reviews will give us the tools we need to address the important issues raised and provide external expertise and recommendations on how best to address them.
""They will build on the support already in place and take a genuine system approach to the development of their recommendations.""
rust - which is rated ""requires improvement"" - is one of the largest in the UK, with four hospitals serving more than two million patients a year.
In a statement, UHB said: ""We welcome the support that is being put in place and we look forward to working positively and constructively with our NHS colleagues.
""This will build upon the work already underway across UHB to understand the issues that have been highlighted. 
""It is very clear that there is a strength of feeling in a number of areas and we are committed to addressing these.""
It added it would focus on providing ""high standards of care, whilst supporting all colleagues, as we head into a particularly challenging winter period"".

business	Firms say government price cut plan 'slap in face'	"A new government campaign asking businesses to cut prices to help with living costs has been branded a ""slap in the face"" for small firms.
Federation of Small Businesses said asking struggling companies to ""soak up additional costs just isn't realistic"".
It's one of a number of groups who have criticised the plan for a taxpayer-funded ad campaign which involves firms slashing product prices from July.
government will be rolling out an official name with branding ""shortly"".
David Buttress, the government's new cost of living tsar, has proposed the ad campaign, but a government source told the BBC that businesses will not be handed any subsidies or funding in order to cut prices.
Martin McTague, national chair of the FSB, said most small firms were ""well beyond the point of being able to absorb extra costs without passing them on, which is often a last resort"".
""It's a slap in the face for government to spend the extra tax it is raising from businesses on state-run marketing campaigns - doubtless focused on big businesses with corporate offers that can now be rebranded as helping the cost of living crisis, and so boost their sales,"" he told the BBC.
""Asking this group to soak up additional costs just isn't realistic, especially when so many are worried about basic survival, and have already cut all expenses, even necessary ones, to the bone.""
Mr McTague argued there was ""much more the government could do to help"", such as reducing VAT rates to lift more small firms out of business rates, ""rather than just a marketing campaign using taxpayer resources to put government branding in shop windows"".
In response, the government said bringing in Mr Buttress on an unpaid basis was ""the latest step taken by the government to ensure we're doing everything we can to help people in this country with the rising cost of living"".
""He will work in partnership with the private sector to identify, develop and promote new and existing business-led initiatives that support people by encouraging businesses to do more to highlight discounted prices or product offers,"" a spokesperson said.
Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices increase - at 9.1%, the highest since March 1982. It is pushing people to cut back on food shopping and car journeys, due to record-high fuel prices, to save money.
f Wetherspoons, Tim Martin, said the campaign proposal was a ""classic example of tinkering, instigated by ministers who really don't understand money"".
""The main economic critique of this government is that it doesn't have an overarching plan, but just reacts to events, like a doctor who only treats symptoms, not the cause,"" he added.
Mr Martin, a vocal supporter of Brexit, said eliminating tariffs on non-EU imports ""such as bananas, rice, coffee and children's clothes and shoes"" would ""immediately reduce shop prices and inflation"".
British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) said asking small retailers to reduce prices was a ""flawed idea"".
""Supply chain inflation has been ahead of consumer inflation for some time, and as a result independent retailers have been operating on reduced margins by suppressing the retail prices,"" said Bira chief executive Andrew Goodacre.
""We believe that government intervention is needed to reduce prices and stimulate demand, and the best way is to reduce VAT,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality, said bars, hotels and restaurants were ""already highly price competitive"" while it was also facing ""colossal input costs that make price reductions extremely difficult"".
""Energy costs are up 74%, goods 55% and labour up 54%, for example,"" she said. ""While government efforts to help consumers are always welcome, the reality is that just one in three hospitality businesses are now profitable.""
In 2020, the government launched the ""Eat Out To Help Out"" scheme to support hospitality businesses - where diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays for a limited period.
government provided funding to the hospitality businesses during this period to fund the discount.
Duncan Brewer, a partner in EY-Parthenon's consumer products and retail team, said price was ""the single most important factor in how customers choose where they shop"", adding retailers were ""working exceptionally hard to give their customers the lowest prices possible"".
""They will be aware that raising prices by more than is absolutely necessary to keep their businesses afloat at this time is a real risk,"" he added.
Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, added many retailers were expanding their value ranges to keep the price of ""essentials down and introducing discounts for vulnerable groups"".
CBI, which hosted Mr Buttress' speech, said it was ""vital the government continues to focus on building business confidence"" to help firms reduce the knock-on effects to consumers. 
""Business will continue to work in partnership with the government to try and mitigate the impact of rising costs across the board,"" a spokesman added."	/news/business-61965785
technology	Space debris Australia: Piece of SpaceX capsule crashes to Earth in field	"When Mick Miners, a farmer in New South Wales, Australia, first saw a large black object sticking out of the ground in a remote part of his land, he thought it was a dead tree.
But on closer inspection - and verification from experts - he learned it had fallen from space. 
Australian Space Agency (ASA) later said it came from a SpaceX capsule.
Experts described the discovery as ""rare"" and ""exciting"" - but said such events may become more common. 
ject landed on 9 July in a large area of fields, but was not discovered by Mr Miners until several weeks later. 
wo other pieces were later found nearby, and the ASA asked anyone who came across further items to contact a debris hotline set up by SpaceX. 
Dr Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at the Australian National University, was called to examine the object. 
He is often called to similar discoveries - the vast majority of which turn out not to be space debris. 
""This has been super exciting to see this all up close, I've never seen a piece of space junk fall like this,"" he said in a video shared online.  
Don Pollacco, a professor of astrophysics at the UK's Warwick University, agreed that it was very rare for space debris to hit land. 
While objects fall from space to Earth every day, the vast majority land in the oceans covering most of the planet, he said. 
What's more, the only recorded case of a person being hit was Lottie Williams, who was unhurt when a piece of space debris landed on her shoulder in Oklahoma, US, in 1997. 
Other incidents include damage to buildings in Ivory Coast in 2020, from pieces of a Chinese rocket. 
However, discoveries on land may become more common - especially as the number of rockets sent to space has hugely increased in recent years.

Perhaps more worrying is a study from Canada's University of British Columbia, published in July, which found there was a 10% chance of one or more people being killed by space debris in the next decade.
But Prof Pollacco still says the chance of an individual being hurt is ""almost zero"", adding: ""I don't think people need to be frightened, the likelihood of them getting hit is unbelievably small.""

sports	Elite League: Giants make it five-in-a-row with win over Clan	"Belfast Giants secured their fifth straight victory with a 6-3 win over Glasgow Clan at the SSE Arena.  
Scott Conway bagged a double for the hosts with Mark Cooper, Lewis Hook, Ben Lake and Ciaran Long also on target. 
Stephen McParland scored twice - one a penalty shot - for the Scots along with a Jordan Cownie strike. 
ry, in front of a season-best 6,500 crowd, sees the champions remain fourth in the Elite League with Glasgow staying firmly rooted to the bottom.  
Giants made a bright start with Jeff Baum testing Clan goaltender John Muse before Darik Angeli almost completed a mazy dribble with a goal five minutes into the contest.  
Glasgow weathered that early storm and Stephen Dixon rattled the Giants post before the home side took the initiative. 
Cooper finished at the far post, set up by fine approach play by David Goodwin and Conway, to give the Giants the lead heading into the first interval.
Clan equalised midway through the second period after McParland was hooked back by Will Cullen.  The Glasgow forward got up to convert the ensuing penalty shot past Jackson Whistle.  
wo penalties called against the Clan - Andrew McLean for holding and Mitch Jones for cross checking - were to prove very costly for the visitors.  
Belfast's leading goalscorer Conway slammed home while the Giants were on the five-on-three power play. 
Still with a man advantage, the Giants swiftly made it 3-1, carving open the beleaguered Clan defence as Hook scored with a simple finish in front of the net.  
Lake then added a fourth before the second break, cleverly delaying his shot before finishing past Muse.  
McParland broke free to reduce Glasgow's arrears nine minutes into the final period. Cownie then added another for 4-3 to set up a tense finish to the match.  
Conway settled the home crowd's nerves with a cool finish with a little over two minutes remaining before Long's empty-netter sealed the points. "	/sport/ice-hockey/64105938
entertainment	Bob Dylan: Coronation Street offers singer a cameo	"Bob Dylan has been offered a cameo on Coronation Street after revealing he is a fan of the ITV soap.
ger discussed his affection for the long-running ITV show in a rare interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Dylan said watching the programme makes him feel ""at home"".
In response, Coronation Street producer Iain MacLeod told The Daily Telegraph Dylan could sing karaoke with characters Ken Barlow and Rita Sullivan.
MacLeod suggested the scene could be part of an open mic night at the Rovers Return pub if Dylan agreed to appear.
""To hear that Bob Dylan is a Coronation Street viewer blows my mind,"" MacLeod said.
""I would absolutely love the idea of him turning up in the Rovers Return one night.
""Maybe we could write in an open mic night and a mysterious singer could roll in out of the Manchester rain and do a turn.""
Dylan released his self-titled debut album in 1962, two years after the first episode of Coronation Street aired.
MacLeod added: ""Both he and Coronation Street established their reputations in the 1960s, both have championed working class voices and causes, both tell stories with a particular sensibility and sense of humour.""
In his interview with The Wall Street Journal, Dylan was asked what he had recently binge watched.
He replied: ""Coronation Street, Father Brown and some early Twilight Zones. I know they're old-fashioned shows but they make me feel at home.
""I'm no fan of packaged programmes or news shows. I never watch anything foul-smelling or evil. Nothing disgusting, nothing dog ass.""

health	South West Acute Hospital: Over 1,000 attend demonstration over cuts	"More than 1,000 people have taken part in a demonstration in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, against cuts to hospital services.
Western Health Trust announced the temporary withdrawal of emergency general surgery from the South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) last month.
Campaigners who organised the protest accused the health trust of betraying the people of the south west.
All political parties have said they are united in opposition to the plans.
It was the second demonstration in Enniskillen within a week, after hundreds of people formed a chain around the hospital last Saturday.
On Friday night, a large sports hall inside the Lakeland Forum leisure centre was filled to capacity to hear from local representatives.
Hundreds of people who were not able to get inside gathered in the car park where they were told the fight would continue.
Olivia Donaghy said she had been attending Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Londonderry for cancer treatment over the past six months.
""I didn't realise the distance till now,"" she said.
""I would not like to be travelling that road if I was taking my children down for emergency surgery.""
""It's a long journey - it's an hour and a half, an hour and 40 minutes - and I am travelling from Irvinestown, which is probably one of the closest areas of Fermanagh to Altnagelvin,"" she added.
Reggie Ferguson, the chairman of the Save Our Acute Services campaign group, said the loss of emergency surgery at the SWAH was one of the biggest issues to face the community in many years.
""Our hospital is very dear to us,"" he said.
""It's important that people come out and support what we are trying to do and then that they empower themselves by getting the politicians to sort this out because it is a political matter.""
Emergency general surgery will stop at the SWAH on 18 December.
Western Health Trust said the temporary withdrawal of emergency general surgery was necessary to protect the public's safety after it had problems recruiting surgical staff.
However, the trust did not say when it expected emergency general surgery to resume.

Other surgeons, mostly of lower grade, will remain on site at the County Fermanagh hospital.

Geraldine McKay, the trust's director of acute services, explained that the decision was taken because of a lack of consultant surgeons.
Ms McKay said the trust had done everything it could to maintain services and was disappointed that it had to make the announcement of the withdrawal of emergency surgery.
She explained that the trust had held six recruitment rounds since 2016 and in that time the hospital had gained five consultant surgeons.
However, during the same period the SWAH lost six consultants - three of whom retired while the other three moved on to other jobs.
In a further move, it has been confirmed the hospital is to become Northern Ireland's third elective surgical hub."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63840613
technology	Twitter's paid blue tick re-launches after pause	"witter's paid-for verification feature is rolling out once again on Monday. It was paused last month after being swamped by impersonators.
It is still $8 per month - but there is now an increased fee of $11 for those using the Twitter app on Apple devices.
witter's owner Elon Musk has previously said in tweets that he resents the commission fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.
witter Blue's additional features include an edit button.
g been a feature requested by many Twitter users, although there are others who argue that it increases the potential for the spread of disinformation, if a tweet is altered after being widely shared.
Blue-tick subscribers will also see fewer ads, have their tweets amplified above others, and be able to post and view longer, better quality videos, the platform says.
Previously a blue tick was used as verification tool for high-profile accounts as a badge of authenticity. It was given out by Twitter for free - but only the firm itself decided who got one. 
Mr Musk argues that this was unfair.
who had a blue tick under the previous regime currently still have them, but now some of these users also have a message which appears if the tick is pressed saying the account is a ""legacy verified account"" and ""may or may not be notable"". 
However, those check marks will now eventually be replaced with either gold (for businesses) or grey (for others such as authorities) badges, according to Twitter's own account.
Under the new system, subscribers who change their names or display photos will lose their blue tick until the account has been reviewed by Twitter.
rvice had a chaotic initial launch in November, when people started impersonating big brands and celebrities and paying for the blue-tick badge in order to make them look authentic.
Many pretended to be Elon Musk himself.
In one instance, a user claiming to be the US pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly tweeted ""insulin is free"", causing the real firm's share price to tumble - however, Eli Lilly has since agreed that insulin prices could indeed be lower.
Having said that, anecdotally, quite a few accounts appeared to take the opportunity to subscribe for legitimate reasons.
Elon Musk has made a number of sweeping changes since he took over Twitter at the end of October after buying it for $44bn (Â£38bn). 
He said the firm was operating at a loss of $4m per day, and that it needed to become profitable.
He has laid-off around half its workforce, introduced bedrooms at Twitter HQ in San Francisco for the remaining staff working long hours, and begun re-instating controversial banned accounts, including the rapper Ye (Kanye West), former US president Donald Trump and influencer Andrew Tate.
Mr Musk also says Twitter accounts which have been inactive for a certain period of time will be deleted. This has caused dismay among those who say they cherish the accounts of loved ones who have died.
Film director Rod Lurie tweeted that his ""heart was broken"" at the thought of the account of his late son, Hunter, disappearing.
Unlike Facebook, Twitter users cannot nominate someone to take control of their account after their death although state executors can contact the firm with requests.

business	Waitrose changes Christmas advert after complaints	"Waitrose has changed a part of its Christmas advert that showed two farmers comparing sun tans after it was criticised by skin cancer patients.
upermarket apologised last week after it received a backlash to its video on social media.
Critics said a section of the advert glorified sun tans and failed to highlight the dangers of sunlight.
Waitrose told the BBC it would now be using an ""updated version of the ad to address these concerns"".
""While we included some light-hearted and 'true to life' moments, we've listened to the comments made about the serious message of sun safety,"" a spokesperson said.

Now the farmers pass each other in the field, without showing off their tans.
One person who has melanoma commented on Waitrose's Facebook post of the advert, saying she found it ""absolutely astonishing that a company like yourselves should be showing farmers glorifying in their sun tans"".
""This is a kick in the teeth for all melanoma patients and for all the organisations trying to educate everyone into the dangers of sun tans,"" she added. ""What on earth were you thinking to include this in a Christmas advert? Words fail me.""

Hannah Hall's son, Finn, 16, was found dead at their home on Friday.
Ms Hall said she contacted the metal health team in the days before his death but claims she was told to go to A&E if she was worried.
Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust  said there will be a ""thorough investigation"" of the case.
Ms Hall, from Keighley, described her son as a ""fun, clever, special"" person who would do ""anything to help anybody"".
But she said he had struggled with his mental health since the age of 11, when he developed an eating disorder.
She said Finn had been in and out of hospital in the year before he died following repeated incidents involving self-harming, adding that he ""found every day a struggle"".
She said Finn asked for help and was known to the children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS).
In the days before his death, the family phoned CAMHS twice because they were worried, she said.
""They said that if I was really worried about him to take him to A&E, but how do you know which time to be really worried when a child is constantly doing it?"" she said.
""I wanted them to take it seriously, I wanted him to have the help that he desperately needed.""
If you have been affected by any of these issues, you can visit the BBC's Action Line, or contact the Samaritans.
In the wake of her son's death she has also called for extra resources for mental health services and encouraged parents to keep talking to their children. 
She said: ""How many more children are going to be lost in this system because there's not enough funding or time or people?
""I know how difficult teenagers are, I know how closed off kids can be, but if we can help just one other family we will have done something for Finn.""
A spokesperson for Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family following this tragic incident.
""Due to patient confidentiality we are unable to comment on individual cases.
""We'd like to give our reassurances that we take issues of patient safety very seriously. In cases such as this we would undertake a thorough investigation to establish the facts and identify any learning for the services involved.""

entertainment	Avicii's family sell music rights to Abba star's company	"family of dance musician Avicii have sold 75% of the rights to his master recordings and publishing to the Swedish entertainment company Pophouse.
will allow Avicii's parents to concentrate on the foundation they established after his death in 2018.
retain the remaining 25% of his rights, ""to ensure a dignified tone"" in how his music is used and promoted.
Pophouse was established by Abba star BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus in 2014, and runs the Abba Voyage show in London. 
In a press release announcing the Avicii deal, the company revealed sales figures for the groundbreaking virtual concert for the first time - with 650,000 tickets sold, and more than 160 sold out performances.
Avicii was born Tim Bergling in 1989, and rose to prominence after posting tracks he'd made in his Stockholm bedroom to dance music websites. 
He set himself apart from his peers by writing songs with emotional pop hooks - and scored a major international hit with Wake Me Up, which blended folky, bluegrass melodies with club-ready beats.
Bergling went on to produce music for Madonna and Coldplay and became one of the world's highest-paid DJs, but he suffered from alcoholism and depression and eventually took his own life at the age of 28.
Since then, his parents Klas Bergling and Anki LidÃ©n have overseen his estate, arranging a star-studded tribute concert, licensing a video game based on his music, and opening an interactive tribute museum in Stockholm earlier this year (the latter was also a joint project with Pophouse).
In a statement, Bergling explained that selling a majority stake in his son's music rights would help to secure his legacy.
""My wife and I feel that as we are getting older, we do not have the right energy level or required skills to fully keep ahead of the new streaming and digital developments vital for such a big, international artist as Tim,"" he wrote. 
""Through this deal, we are also securing the Tim Bergling Foundation's long-term finances, creating opportunity to act decisively on the foundation's commitments to supporting such important issues as mental health and well-being of young people.""
He explained that the deal would bring Avicii's music ""to the widest possible audience"" and ""take care"" of his international fanbase. 
""Since Tim took his life, as a family, we have not had sufficient time for his fans that they so deserve, and have lacked the ability to follow up on their correspondence and other contact with us,"" Bergling wrote.
""We leave neither Tim nor his contribution to the world. He is always within us and so is his music.""
Avicii deal comes six months after Pophouse acquired the master recordings and publishing assets of dance icons Swedish House Mafia. No figure has been disclosed for the acquisition.
five years have seen a flurry of similar deals, with artists like Bob Dylan, Shakira, Blondie and Neil Young selling the rights to their catalogues to companies who promise to safeguard their legacy, while profiting from the royalties.

business	TSB fined Â£49m over IT system meltdown	"SB has been fined nearly Â£49m for an IT meltdown in 2018 that caused chaos and left its customers unable to access online accounts for several weeks.
UK's financial regulator said the failings were ""widespread and serious"" and led to ""significant disruption"".
roblems began in April 2018 when an attempt to move data to a new computer system went wrong.
All areas of TSB's services were affected, including branch, telephone and online banking.
roblems were not fully resolved for eight months and ""a significant proportion of its 5.2 million customers were affected by the initial issues"", the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said.
It led to the departure of the bank's then chief executive Paul Pester.
Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: ""The failings in this case were widespread and serious which had a real impact on the day-to-day lives of a significant proportion of TSB's customers, including those who were vulnerable.""
FCA said TSB had paid Â£32.7m in compensation to customers who were affected by the problems.
SB chief executive Robin Bulloch said: ""We'd like to apologise again to TSB customers who were impacted by issues following the technology migration in 2018. We worked hard to put things right for customers then and have since transformed our business.""
roblems were triggered when TSB tried to move 1.3 billion customer records from an old system run by its former parent bank, Lloyds, to one managed by its current Spanish owner, Sabadell.
However, it proved disastrous with many customers being locked out of their accounts and some customers being given access to the confidential records of others.
Cases included people trying to complete house purchases and unsure whether they could move in. The BBC spoke to one couple who sat with a loaded removal van outside their new home waiting for funds to be released.
Another couple who were locked out of their wedding savings were forced to grovel to their DJ and wedding car provider because they were unable to pay them as the big day approached.
Businesses were also left in difficulty. Lee MacDonald, who played Zammo in children's TV show Grange Hill in the 1980s, told BBC Radio 5 live that he was ""having an absolute nightmare"" in his locksmith business.
Shortly after the issues emerged, Mr Pester admitted to the BBC that the bank was ""on our knees"".
roblems continued for many weeks and TSB came under fierce criticism for the IT failings. Mr Pester was directly, and unusually, criticised by MPs for the saga. 
FCA said while data itself was transferred successfully, the IT platform ""immediately experienced technical failures"".
""This resulted in significant disruption to the continuity of TSB's banking services, including branch, telephone, online and mobile banking,"" it said.
Mr Steward added: ""The firm failed to plan for the IT migration properly, the governance of the project was insufficiently robust and the firm failed to take reasonable care to organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems.""
SB was fined a total of Â£48.65m - made up of a Â£29.75m penalty from the FCA and a fine of Â£18.9m from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
""The disruption to continuity of service experienced by TSB during its IT migration fell below the standard we expect banks to meet,"" said Sam Woods, the PRA's chief executive.
In February 2019, TSB said that the disastrous IT upgrade had cost it Â£330m, and about 80,000 customers had switched their account away from the bank in 2018.
mplexity of the switchover and the problems it caused has meant a long investigation and eventual fine by the regulator. In the meantime, there has been significant reputational damage for the bank."	/news/business-64036529

An unnamed collector from Asia bought the artwork on Monday. 
Composition No. II is an example of the artist's signature style. He is most recognised for his abstract, geometric and colourful grid designs that revolutionised the art world.

sports	Serena Williams: 'Almost the end of an era' with American icon set to retire	"It is almost the end of an era.
Serena Williams, the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion, one of the greatest tennis players of all time and a sporting icon, is set to retire.
It is difficult to imagine tennis without the American legend, who has won all there is to win during her 27-year career.
From a purely sporting point of view, Williams will be remembered as one of the game's greatest competitors, an athlete who possessed the purest serve in the women's game and a never-fading desire to win.
She will also be remembered for speaking out against racism, pushing for gender parity and equal prize money, and about her experiences of the healthcare system as a black woman.
World number 11 Coco Gauff, 18, said Williams was ""the reason why I play tennis"" and her legacy can ""inspire many more generations"", while British number one Emma Raducanu, 19, said she ""changed the game"".
""Tennis being a predominantly white sport it definitely helped a lot,"" said Gauff. ""Because I saw somebody who looked like me dominating the game. It made me believe that I could dominate too.""
Here, BBC Sport looks at the big moments from an iconic career.
Aged just 17, Williams produced a fine run to lift her first Grand Slam singles title in New York. She beat world number four Monica Seles in the quarter-finals, then second-ranked Lindsey Davenport before meeting world number one Martina Hingis in the final. 
Williams claimed a straight-set victory to become the first African-American woman in the Open Era to win a singles major. Just for good measure, she and Venus then won the doubles title together in the same weekend.
Both Williams sisters have spoken about the racism they experienced throughout their career in a traditionally white sport and the issues their father, Richard, faced.
rs were set to meet in the semi-finals of Indian Wells - one of the biggest events outside of the Grand Slams - in 2001. However, when Venus withdrew with injury, accusations of match-fixing were pointed towards Richard and the sisters. Serena was then heavily booed when she came out to play Kim Clijsters in the final, and both Richard and Venus said they were racially abused by the crowd.
Serena won and instantly hugged her father in the stands. She and Venus then boycotted the event for many years, with Serena not returning until 2015 and Venus a year later.
Williams arrived in Melbourne on the back of an amazing Grand Slam streak, having won every major since the 2002 French Open. Only the Australian Open trophy was absent from her cabinet.
She had to do it the hard way in Melbourne, saving two match points and overturning a 5-1 third set deficit against Kim Clijsters in the semi-finals to reach the final. She then beat Venus for her fourth consecutive major singles triumph. It also secured a career Grand Slam and a non-calendar year Grand Slam for Williams at just 22 years old.
Williams' triumphs on the Wimbledon grass were the start of a resurgent few years that saw her win another nine major singles titles.
She followed up her Wimbledon title run with a dominant performance to claim Olympic singles gold. Williams thrashed Maria Sharapova 6-0 6-1 in just 62 minutes on the same court where Sharapova had so memorably beaten her in 2004. It was the heaviest defeat for Sharapova against Williams, with the American winning 22 of their 24 meetings over 15 years.
Williams started and ended the 2015 season as world number one, winning the Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon to go with her 2014 US Open title and secure yet another 'Serena Slam'.
She was on course for the calendar Grand Slam in New York and faced Italy's Roberta Vinci in the semi-finals, who she had beat four times in a row. She won the first set and led 2-0 in the decider before the unseeded Italian came back to stun Williams and the crowd. Williams later described the loss as one that broke her heart.
Williams found out she was expecting her first child shortly before the first Grand Slam of the year. At eight weeks pregnant she clinched her eighth Australian Open title and passed Steffi Graf in the all-time list of major winners in the Open Era, with only Margaret Court ahead of her. 
She did not drop a set in Melbourne and, to underline her dominance, returned to the top of the world rankings before going on maternity leave.
Williams has spoken extensively about the struggles black women in the United States experience in healthcare, particularly in regards to complications in pregnancy or childbirth. Williams herself almost died after giving birth to Olympia because of an embolism.
She made her Grand Slam return at Roland Garros eight months after giving birth and wore a black catsuit which, as well as making her feel like 'a queen from Wakanda', helped her cope with blood clots. Two months later, she would reach the Wimbledon final, where she lost to Angelique Kerber.
Williams said several times that breaking Court's record was ""the only reason"" she still played following her daughter's birth and it seemed fitting that she could equal it on her home turf after reaching the US Open final.
Williams was the heavy favourite against maiden finalist Naomi Osaka. However, Williams' outburst at umpire Carlos Ramos, where she called him a liar and thief after being docked three points, divided opinion and led to a hostile New York crowd. Osaka triumphed but both players were in tears by the end.
With rumours swirling of retirement, it felt cruel that the last time Wimbledon would see the American great would be when she limped off in tears in the first round in 2021 after injuring her ankle.
However, her surprise decision to compete in singles through a wildcard led to a late-night thriller against France's Harmony Tan. Williams thrilled the crowd and showed all her competitiveness before going down in three sets.
As she left to a standing ovation, she stood and twirled one last time on the stage that has brought her and the fans so much joy over the years.

business	Elon Musk warns Twitter deal stuck without fake account proof	"Elon Musk has said his $44bn deal to buy Twitter may be in jeopardy due to a disagreement over the number of fake accounts on the social media platform.
Mr Musk tweeted that the deal ""cannot move forward"" unless Twitter backs up its claims that less than 5% of daily users are fake or spam accounts.
witter has defended its figures, adding that Mr Musk waived rights to ""due diligence"" to clinch the deal.
raised doubts about the takeover.
Analysts have speculated that Mr Musk may be looking for ways to renegotiate the price of the deal or walk away.
Mr Musk agreed the $44bn (Â£34.5bn) deal to buy Twitter with its board in April, but last week Mr Musk said the deal was ""on hold"" while he sought details about fake accounts.
He has continued to press the issue in tweets and public appearances, while also hinting that he could seek a lower price.
On Tuesday, Mr Musk said Twitter boss Parag Agrawal had ""publicly refused to show proof"" that fewer than 5% of its accounts were fake, and said the deal ""cannot move forward"" until Mr Agrawal does show proof.
Mr Musk's tweet then appeared to be deleted.
re, who also runs carmaker Tesla, has put the number of fake accounts at 20% or more.
Elon Musk has doubled down on his position that his deal to buy the social network is on ice while the actual amount of spambots and accounts operating on it is investigated.
witter chief executive Parag Agrawal has hit back, and tempers are flaring.
When the richest man in the world replies to one of your tweets with just one symbol, the poo emoji, well, I suppose at least you know you've got his attention.
I long ago gave up trying to read the mind of Elon Musk but let's indulge in a moment of speculation.
He's making a big deal about fake accounts. Is it a convenient peg on which to hang a renegotiation? His initial $44bn offer for the firm was considerably higher than its current stock suggests.
He moved swiftly and aggressively, perhaps even impulsively.
fund it, he's already had to sell a chunk of shares in one of his other companies, the electric car firm Tesla, and that in turn made a dent in the value of that company as it made other investors nervous.
If either party in the Twitter deal walks away now, there's a $1bn termination fee.
may sound like small change to a multi-billionaire - although Mr Musk maintains he is asset-rich rather than cash-rich - but it perhaps gives him leverage to successfully shave a few billion off the offer price, because $1bn is not small change to Twitter and its shareholders.
However, Mr Musk might be right to question Twitter's worth.
If it really isn't bloated with spam, then perhaps it has less potential to be made great again, a phrase that may sound familiar given that he has already indicated that he would like to re-instate former US President Donald Trump.
Mr Trump, by the way, has so far declined the invitation.
Mr Musk and Mr Agrawal have been publicly debating the spambot figures on Twitter but relations appear to have soured. 
On Monday, Mr Musk responded to Mr Agrawal's defence of the the firm's spam reporting with a poo emoji, later repeating his claim that Twitter was underestimating the figure.
Mr Musk has said he is concerned that advertisers on Twitter don't know what they are paying for.
""So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,"" he wrote.
After putting his offer on hold Mr Musk told a conference in Miami on Monday that ""you can't pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed"".
He said that a deal is ""not out of the question"" at a different price but added: ""The more questions I ask, the more my concerns grow.""
witter has said it is committed to completing the deal at the agreed price. 
In a filing with regulators on Tuesday, it told shareholders that Mr Musk's apparent eagerness to get the deal done, even without ordinary research into the business, set him apart from any other potential suitors.
""Other potential [buyers] would require substantial due diligence, creating a delay and risk to reaching the signing of such a potential transaction,"" it said.
Mr Musk has called for tests of random samples of Twitter users to identify bots. He said ""there is some chance it might be over 90% of daily active users"".
Researchers have estimated that anywhere from 4% to 20% or more of the millions of Twitter profiles are fake.
witter shares on Monday closed more than 8% down at $37.39, sowing doubts that Mr Musk would go ahead with his acquisition at the agreed price.
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that it ""looks increasingly likely that Elon Musk is positioning to renegotiate a sharply lower price tag for Twitter or even try and pull the pin on the deal"".
She said that establishing the number of real users on Twitter is considered ""vital to future revenue streams via advertising or paid for subscriptions on the site"".
""The volatility which has hit tech stocks and contributed to a sharp decline in Twitter's valuation is also highly likely to be part of the equation,"" Ms Streeter said, adding that Mr Musk is ""clearly rueing the timing of his rash offer to pay $44bn for the social network""."	/news/business-61432483

business	Jerome Powell: US stock markets down after interest rate warning	"Stock markets in the US ended the week sharply down following tough comments by the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve.
k's chairman, Jerome Powell, said the bank must continue to raise interest rates to stop inflation from becoming a permanent aspect of the US economy.
His words sent US stocks into a tailspin, with markets tumbling 3%.
It comes as Americans are having to pay more for basic goods.
Inflation in the world's largest economy is at a four-decade high.
During a highly anticipated speech at a conference in Wyoming on Friday, Mr Powell said the Federal Reserve would probably impose further interest rate hikes in the coming months and could keep them high ""for some time"".
""Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,"" he said at the meeting in Jackson Hole.
Investors are concerned that if economic growth falters, higher interest rates will increase the likelihood of a recession. 
Mr Powell conceded that getting inflation under control would come at a cost to American households and businesses but he argued it was a price worth paying.
""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labour market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to household and businesses,"" he said. 
""These are unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.""
Mr Powell wants to avoid inflation becoming entrenched. Simply put, that means if people believe inflation will be high, they will alter their behaviour accordingly, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, someone who thinks prices will go up 3% next year is more likely to seek a 3% rise in wages.
me this happened, Mr Powell's predecessor, Paul Volcker, had to slam on the brakes, raising interest rates dramatically and sending the economy into recession. 
In March, the Federal Reserve's key interest rate was almost zero; it has since been raised to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% in an effort to tackle inflation."	/news/business-62695937
entertainment	Coleridge-Taylor: Composer's family call for further recognition	"f composer Avril Coleridge-Taylor are calling for wider recognition of her music. 
ughter of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, who was known as the 'African Mahler', says she was inspired by the East Sussex countryside.
Her family said being a female composer and a woman of colour may have ""held her back"".
Years after her death in Seaford in 1998, her family discovered boxes of her compositions. 
Fiona Dashwood, the widow of Ms Coleridge-Taylor's late grandson, recently discovered her work after inheriting boxes of what she first believed contained Samuel Coleridge-Taylor's archive material.
After the discovery of her music, Ms Dashwood said that while well known in her heyday, being a woman of mixed heritage was likely to have hindered her.
""I don't think she was given the kudos she should've been,"" Ms Dashwood said. ""As a family, we'd like her to be better known.""
In 1952, Ms Coleridge-Taylor left South Africa during apartheid after the government learnt of her African heritage, Ms Dashwood said.
She also published compositions written in Sussex under the pseudonym Peter Riley.
Ms Dashwood added: ""She'd had such a terrible time, I think Sussex meant an awful lot to her.
""She was a bit of a nomad, but she stayed in Sussex. One of the poems she quotes says she got solace from the hills, from the South Downs, from the sea.""
Ms Coleridge-Taylor's granddaughter, Caroline Preece, says it has been ""an absolute joy"" to discover her music.
""In the family, I don't think we knew about her too much - and not from the world perspective,"" she said.
""Everyone is beginning to realise what a wonderful composer she was. I'm hoping her music will be widely performed.""

business	Netflix cuts 150 US-based jobs after losing subscribers	"Netflix has made about 150 staff redundant, a month after the streaming service said it was losing subscribers for the first time in a decade.
redundancies, announced by the entertainment giant on Tuesday, will mainly affect its US office in California. They account for about 2% of its North American workforce.
Netflix said the job losses were due to the slump in the company's revenue.
reaming service is battling an exodus of viewers this year.
""These changes are primarily driven by business needs rather than individual performance, which makes them especially tough as none of us want to say goodbye to such great colleagues,"" the company said in a statement.
It wasn't disclosed which parts of the business would see job losses, but the Los Angeles Times reported that recruiting, communications and also the content department were all affected.
Some people also disclosed their job loss online.
In April, the streaming giant shocked the industry when it revealed it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the first three months of 2022, and warned another two million were expected to quit in the coming quarter.
ws sparked an investor sell-off, with the firm's stock plunging 35% in one day. It is now trading at $190 (Â£152), a 46% drop on its previous premium.
While Netflix has 220 million subscribers globally and remains the clear market leader, it has faced fierce competition in recent years with the arrival of competitor platforms such as Disney Plus, HBO, and Amazon's Prime Video.
In its earnings report last month, the company also said the war in Ukraine and the decision to raise its prices in the US had cost it subscribers. 
Pulling out of the Russian market alone had cost the service 700,000 members, it revealed.
Along with job losses, the company is also cutting content and pulling back on its own creations. Earlier in May it cancelled development of Pearl, an animated series created by Meghan Markle, in its move to cut costs.
Some analysts say that after a surge in sign-ups during the pandemic, Netflix has run out of easy ways to grow the business.
mpany says it's looking at a cheaper, ad-based model and also planning on cracking down on password sharing which has cost it 100 million households.
Netflix is not alone in making job cuts. In recent weeks, a slew of US tech companies from start-ups to big names such as Uber and Twitter have said they are slowing or freezing hiring, or, like online car sales firm Carvana, announced redundancies, citing a downturn.

sports	Tom Bosworth: Retiring British racewalker says career was not 'supposed to happen to me'	"One early autumn evening in 2001, a skinny boy with a shock of flame hair followed his big sister along to a local athletics track.
m Bosworth was, in his words ""rubbish at PE but wanted to keep fit"". In truth he was not much better at this either. In his first race, he finished last. He came back the following week, but finished last again. He kept coming back.
week that skinny lad with the flame hair, now 32, retires from athletics as a double-Olympian with multiple world records, 21 British titles and a Commonwealth Games silver medal to his name.
""None of this was supposed to happen to me,"" said Bosworth after bringing down the curtain on a storied race walking career on Monday with one final 3km race around that same track in Tonbridge, Kent.
""Sport was never meant to be for someone like me, a skinny lad who was rubbish at PE. I just turned up to enjoy it and keep fit - it was never meant to be anything else. I just kept turning up, coming back and giving my all. It led me to all of this.""
By ""this"", Bosworth is referring to his position as someone who has transcended his event to become one of the more recognisable British athletes to have pulled on a vest over the past decade.
In October 2015 the British number one came out as gay on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show and since then has become a high profile ambassador in the LGBT+ community and a steering force behind the Athletics Pride Network, launched in 2020. 
Footage went viral of him proposing to boyfriend Harry Dineley on Copacabana Beach in Rio after a stunning sixth-place finish at his first Olympic Games in 2016.
Bosworth admitted: ""I'd always planned to do it there, but I never expected for the race to go like that or to finish that high. It was a month when our lives changed forever and it'll always be special.""
Bosworth says he fully embraces his role-model status, adding: ""I'm proud of it, though it was accidental to be honest. I am just literally being me. I was just tired of hiding so I put it out there.""
While he feels he has been embraced by most in his sport, he admits: ""Athletics is so diverse and you don't realise quite what the environment is like out there, especially within sport. 
""It has opened my eyes to a world that saddens me, but even so I have no regrets about doing it, ever.""
Bosworth claims popularising a sport which he admits ""looks a little silly"" prepared him for the challenge. 
""I am very proud of bringing race walking to the athletics masses - with the support of a lot of other people, of course,"" he added.
""It's a little bit of a weird event but helping people to learn how hard it is, getting the technique right, then doing it for 20km, then doing it at faster speed than many people run atâ¦ it's difficult. 
""It was the same with living openly and being who I am. Everyone embraced that eventually.""
While he is already on the lookout for ""crazy ideas"" for new challenges, Bosworth is looking forward to transitioning to ""normal"" life - and first up is his stag do in Madrid before his wedding in October. 
He will be appearing on TV in the Celebrity Chase in the coming weeks and is more than open to a spot in 'I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here' this winter, should the producers call.
Unlike many of his Team GB peers, Bosworth did not get to experience the magic of the London Olympics, but says the defining moment of his career came in La Coruna, Spain, six weeks before it. 
Despite smashing his own personal best in the 20km race walk by more than a minute, his finishing time of just under 85 minutes was an agonising 19 seconds shy of the qualifying time for London 2012.
He admitted: ""Not qualifying gave me the boot up the backside I probably needed - I never wanted to feel like that or be in that position again. 
""Maybe if I went to London and finished in the top 30 or 40 that would have been enough - London was such a spectacular event and maybe I would never have had that motivation to go on and do more in sport. I am so glad, in a way, that I didn't go.""
Unlike on his first visit all those years ago, Bosworth left the track as a winner. He led a field of 21 walkers from under-13s to over-50s home in front of a crowd including Winter Olympic gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold and athletics royalty Julie Asher-Smith, mother of sprinter Dina, and Geoff Wightman, father of 1500m world champion Jake, at a meeting to mark 75 years of Tonbridge AC.
""My aim was always to go on until Paris, a third Olympics, but my body started to break down and I said I didn't want to go to championships just to finish,"" admitted Bosworth.
""I wanted it to end like this, on my home track against walkers of all ages, because that's what race walking is about, and that's the sort of race I started out with. It was never about results or the time, it was a celebration. 
""I had the emotion and sadness after the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham when I thought 'I am not going to do this ever again'. It really hit home, but as soon as it was over I thought 'no, I don't want to do that ever again, it hurts so bad'. Now I just feel massive relief.
""It's been a lot of sacrifice over the past 15 years in particular, but it all feels worth it. I'm lucky to be able to say enough is enough - not all athletes get to do that - and I can look back with pride on everything I've achieved."""	/sport/athletics/62726334
business	Black Friday fails to lift sales in November	"Retail sales saw a surprise fall last month after Black Friday failed to give its expected boost to online shopping.
With household budgets remaining under pressure from rising prices, sales volumes dropped 0.4% in November, official figures showed.
fall could be bad news for some stores, which are entering a crucial time of the year for sales.
However, there were signs people were buying Christmas food early in order to spread the cost of the festive season.
Sales at food stores rose 0.9% last month with people ""stocking up early"" for Christmas, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Research carried out for the BBC has suggested Christmas dinner will be nearly 22% more expensive this year than in 2021.
""Retail sales fell overall in November, driven by a notable drop for online retailers, with Black Friday offers failing to provide their usual lift in this sector,"" said ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan.
But he pointed out that department stores had reported better sales, with bosses saying a longer Black Friday sales period had drawn in more customers. 
Sales at clothing stores rose by 2.1%, the ONS said, mainly due to a better performance from shoe stores. 
figures suggest shoppers are ""focusing on essentials like food and footwear"", said Kevin Bright, an analyst at McKinsey & Co.
UK is predicted to face its biggest drop in living standards on record as wages struggle to keep up with rising prices.
Figures out this week showed prices went up by 10.7% in the year to November, indicating the cost of living is still rising at its fastest pace for about 40 years.
Melanie Thompson, who runs a wine and cheese shop at the Piece Hall in Halifax, said people were being more careful about what they spend.
""Before, people might have bought a full case of wine. Now they're buying one or two bottles and using up some of the spirits they have at home,"" she added.
mixed effect from the recent train strikes, with fewer customers from further away, but more locals visiting.
Retail analyst Natalie Berg said it was no surprise that Black Friday had been a ""damp squib"".
""The appeal of Black Friday has also been diluted because shoppers have cottoned on to the fact that it's a manufactured event and prices are not always at their lowest on the day,"" she said.
""The problem is exacerbated by the fact that retailers are sitting on a lot of inventory right now, so we've seen a constant stream of discounts since September.""
Sales volumes are still below pre-Covid levels, according to the ONS, and the boss of the Waterstones bookshop chain, James Daunt, told the BBC most retailers were still ""probably expecting 2023 to be a time to batten down and concentrate on the basics because it is going to be tough"".
Shoppers have less money to spend because they are dealing with higher energy bills and higher interest rates, he added.
""In our case, books do very well and continue to be resilient, but we also rely on our neighbours being full of people and the general health of retail footfall. When everything is going down, everyone suffers a bit,"" Mr Daunt told the BBC's Today programme.
Non-store sales - which mainly covers online retailers - fell by 2.8% last month, the ONS said. This figure has been declining for some time since Covid restrictions were lifted and people could return to shops, although online sales still remain well above pre-pandemic levels.
But the chairman of toy retailer The Entertainer, Gary Grant, told the BBC that worries over postal strikes and the weather had led to ""a swing from the web sales to our shops"".
""If I was buying anything for my grandchildren this Christmas, I think I'd be strolling down the High Street and walking out of the shop with it under my arm knowing there's no worry about the carton arriving,"" he said.
Earlier this week, a retail group and Waterstones advised people to use stores rather than rely on online shopping if they want to get Christmas gifts on time.
Retail sales had been expected to rise last month, so the surprise fall is not a good sign for the Christmas trading period, which is the most important time for many shops.
Mr Grant said a quarter of The Entertainer's annual sales take place in one month, and next week will account for 8% of its entire year's turnover.
Jacqui Baker, head of retail at consultancy firm RSM, said industrial strikes and extreme weather had created ""further barriers for consumers to splurge"".
""It's likely to be a disappointing end to the year for the retail sector,"" she added.

entertainment	Selma Blair: 'Multiple sclerosis took my career down'	"Selma Blair: âMS took my career downâ
US actress Selma Blair says speaking publicly about her multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis has had a major impact on her career in Hollywood.
""When I talked about it, there was so much support, but I never got a job again,"" she tells BBC 100 Women.
Blair had experienced fatigue and speech disturbances since her youth, but doctors took many years to establish what was wrong.
Her unexplained health issues led to years of feeling low but she says she kept them secret.
""I was ashamed and concerned I wouldn't work again."" 
Doctors often assumed the problem was psychological.
""They would say, 'OK, what kind of trauma have you had?' 'We do think this is psychosomatic.' But without any real neurological tests.""
When Blair was finally diagnosed in 2018, she felt ""unburdened"".
""It was a relief. There was a little bit of panic, like how will I have the energy to ever even deal with this? 
""I had been down that road for so many years without a diagnosis that I did feel kind of hopeless still, but I was hoping that the diagnosis of MS would give me so many more options.
""It was an amazing, comforting feeling to know that there was a whole community of chronic illness or MS patients.""
Selma Blair is one of the women featured on the BBC 100 Women list, which each year names 100 inspiring and influential women around the world. This year the list is honouring the progress that has been made since its inception 10 years ago.
Known for iconic films such as Cruel Intentions and Legally Blonde, Blair is now focusing on being an ally to the MS community and increasing the visibility of disabled people in film and television.
""Hollywood has been a family,"" she says.
""I made incredible women friends. There isn't a movie that I was on that I didn't make friends with the wardrobe, hair, make-up, the stars - Sarah Michelle Gellar especially, and Jaime King.
""I thank my lucky stars for that because they're the people I've gone to when I needed allies and they were there.""
She thinks Hollywood has made progress with regard to the representation of disabled people, but wants it to do more.
""There is a bigger responsibility to create iconic images with people that have disabilities,"" she says.
""I know that my own MS took my career down. I had to stop working for years, even before I had my son [in 2011], because I wasn't well.
""Disability was affecting me and taking me out of the workforce and it created huge changes in my physical appearanceâ¦ things that couldn't be in a movie or a TV show.""
Blair says she's not bitter about a lack of acting offers since her diagnosis: ""I don't know how much I've said 'Oh my God, I'm willing to be on a set all day.'""
But she does want to get back to filming: ""I hope that my own knowledge of what I can handle can be a strength for me, because the people you work with do want to know what you can handle.""
She recently appeared in the US television show Dancing with the Stars, as a way to check her stamina. Earlier than planned, she had to leave the competition because of the impact training was having on her health.
""I deserved the chance to try,"" she says.
""I was so proud of what Dancing with the Stars did by having someone like me on the show. There were so many things they were doing for the disabled community about visibility that are important to me.""
Earlier this year, Blair published a memoir detailing her experiences of MS, as well as looking back at her life and career.
""I wanted to write a book for the little Selmas out there that are afraid,"" she says. 
As a younger actress working in Hollywood, Blair had a long-term problem with alcohol that she kept secret.
""I didn't know how many people felt broken like me,"" she says.
""Saying 'I'm fine' all the time is what made me drink in a bathroom at the age of nine until I'd pass out.""
Writing her book has been a form of therapy, Blair says, as has collaborating on an inclusive make-up line with more accessible tools.
Due to MS symptoms, Blair says she would often hurt herself when applying cosmetics.
Earlier this year she was announced as chief creative officer of Guide Beauty, an ergonomic brand that designs its products for people living with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, autism and traumatic brain injuries.
But while Blair sees progress being made in Hollywood and in some US business sectors, she also points out areas of life which she says have taken a step back for women in the country - such as reproductive rights.
""I was as shocked as many people when Roe v Wade like overnight was overturned,"" she says. ""I thought there were more safeguards.""
Earlier this year a ruling by the US Supreme Court effectively ended the constitutional right to abortion for millions of US women.
""I thought it was very frightening that could be undone, that so many people feel the need to control our bodies and our decisions.""
Blair remains hopeful for the future, and draws comfort from the fact that it is the support of other women which has allowed her to continue and thrive.
""We need to know that we are strong,"" she says.
""We will have to get our votes in. We have to stand up and be visible, we will not be silenced with our own bodies.""

business	Workers at Heathrow to strike in World Cup run-up	"Strike action by hundreds of workers at Heathrow Airport could hit football fans heading to the World Cup in Qatar, a union has warned.
Unite said 700 workers who work in the ground handling, airside transport and cargo side of the airport will go on strike for three days from 18 November.
It said the strike action would cause disruption and delays at Heathrow terminals 2, 3 and 4.
ff, employed by Dnata and Menzies, are calling for higher pay.
""Strike action will inevitably cause disruption, delays and cancellations to flights throughout Heathrow, with travellers to the World Cup particularly affected,"" Unite regional officer Kevin Hall warned.
World Cup is set to begin in Qatar on 20 November and the union said it expected Qatar Airways, which has put on extra flights for football fans, to be ""hit heavily"" by the strike action.
But Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said the union's members at Dnata and Menzies ""are simply seeking a decent pay rise"".
She added: ""Both companies are highly profitable and can fully afford to make a fair pay increase.""
union said other airlines, including Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Emirates will also be affected.
Passengers travelling to the United States for the Thanksgiving holiday might also be hit.
A Heathrow spokesperson said: ""We are aware of proposed industrial action from Dnata and Menzies colleagues at Heathrow, and we are in discussions with our airline partners on what contingency plans they can implement to support their ground handling should the strike go ahead.""
kesperson added that the airport's priority is to ensure passengers are not disrupted by any shortages of airline ground handlers.
Alex Doisneau, managing director of Dnata UK, called the industrial action ""disappointing"" and ""costly"".
She said its staff have been offered a pay award which is ""in line with inflation and among the best in the industry"".
""We would like to reassure our customers, partners and passengers that we are implementing contingency plans to minimise disruption to our operations.""
Menzies said the strike action ""will benefit no one"". Miguel Gomez Sjunnesson, executive vice president Europe at Menzies Aviation, said the firm was ""ready and willing to continue pay discussions"", and urged Unite to take part in the negotiations.
He added: ""I also want to reassure our airline customers and their passengers that we have robust contingency plans in place should Unite elect to continue with unnecessary industrial action.""
Queues, delays and cancellations frustrated thousands of travellers earlier this year. 
were largely caused by staff shortages in the aviation industry. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs at the height of the pandemic, have struggled to recruit staff as demand for international travel has returned.
It led to Heathrow Airport demanding airlines stop selling summer tickets and placing a cap on passenger numbers at busy times.
Strikes have also played a part in the disruption. Refuelling workers, postal workers and check-in staff at Heathrow were among several groups to strike or vote in favour of industrial action earlier this year.
Prices are currently rising at the fastest pace for 40 years, prompting many unions and workers in the UK to ask for pay increases."	/news/business-63510375
business	Aberdeen paper mill redundancies 'a hammer blow' for staff	"Mill job losses 'mark the passing of a great industry'
Hundreds of redundancies at Aberdeen's last paper mill came ""totally out the blue"", devastated workers have said.
Stoneywood paper mill - which has operated for more than 250 years - went into administration on Thursday with the loss of more than 300 jobs.
Calum Mackay, who worked at the mill for 10 years, told BBC Scotland it was a ""hammer blow"".
Scottish Enterprise has given the mill owners more than Â£12m worth of support over the last three years.
In 2019, the business was sold to a new parent company, securing the jobs at the mill.
However, administrators have now been appointed at the Arjowiggins Group mills at Stoneywood, as well as Chartham, Kent, with 368 of the group's 463 UK-based employees made redundant immediately.
A total of 301 out of the 372 members of staff in Aberdeen have been made redundant.
A total of 95 staff have been retained to continue limited activity at the two sites while the administrators explore the possibility that the sites and assets could be sold.
Mr Mackay, who was the union convener at the mill, said workers were told on Thursday afternoon to attend a meeting an hour later.
He said: ""We were told that we were redundant, they had exhausted every avenue they had to try and keep the place open.
""We had been expecting a buy over, unfortunately instead we got a hammer blow.
""Obviously it was no surprise to any of us to the learn the company was in trouble, that had been the case for a long time, since 2019 we've had severe issues, and the management team have struggled to keep the operation going.""
He described the sudden news of administration as ""an absolute shock, totally out the blue"".
Mr Mackay said: ""The site has been here for 252 years, an awful lot of the families that were here 252 years ago are still here. 
""It's devastating, very distressing.""
He said many staff members were in the later stages of their working life.
""They are going to struggle, they really are,"" he said.
""It really is the end of an era, a large part of Aberdeen's history revolved around mills, to see it go, it's a tragedy for the area, it's a tragedy for Scotland.
""It marks the passing of a once-great industry.""
Shauna Wright, of the Unite union, said workers were saddened at the sudden news.
""None of the members were expecting anything like this at all,"" she said.
""It really hasn't sunk in to a lot of our members, we are still trying to understand how did this happen so quickly.""
A mass meeting is being organised for next week.
Scottish government described the situation as ""concerning"".
""This will be a very uncertain time for the company's staff, their families and the local areas, which will be affected by this decision,"" it said.
""Scottish Enterprise will work with the administrators to understand the potential options for the business going forward and explore all possibilities to rescue the jobs.""
Scottish Enterprise said its interventions had helped maintain an important employer's presence in Aberdeen and protect employees' jobs since it first went into voluntary administration in January 2019.
""Our decisions to support Arjowiggins were based on a shared view, alongside private investors, that the company had a viable future,"" it said.
""However, conditions deteriorated and despite the best efforts of everyone involved it was not possible to secure a sale of the business as a going concern."" 
mill had been bought for an undisclosed sum in September 2019 by subsidiaries of a new venture, Creative Paper Holdings Ltd."	/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-63007605
technology	How to make movies without a huge carbon footprint	"green memo sent out by the production team of the programme Poldark asked that the location department use low-carbon suppliers of lighting and reusable batteries wherever possible.
request was vague and the expectations unclear. But such requests are increasingly mainstream and point to the growing awareness in the film and TV industry of its carbon dioxide emissions.
In film and TV production, the main sources of carbon emissions are transport and energy. According to the report Screen New Deal, the average big budget film production produces 2,840 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. It would take 3,709 acres of forest a year to absorb this amount. 
Half of this comes from fuel, 30% from energy utilities, and 16% from air travel.
Louise Smith focuses on transport and energy when she's brought in to advise a film or TV production on cutting its carbon footprint. She has worked on films including the most recent James Bond instalment No Time to Die and Jurassic World: Dominion. Unusually for people in this role, her background is in environmental science, rather than in film and TV.
""Usually I try and get involved as early as possible,"" says Ms Smith, a sustainability consultant with Neptune Environmental Solutions.
ws for her to assess the filming locations to see the needs for grid or mobile power. For on-set filming, the studio ideally has a renewable electricity contract already. 
A big energy issue is diesel, which has traditionally been used to power the heavy vehicles and generators needed for filming. Generators are especially important for filming on location in spots where the power grid can't be accessed.
Productions have increasingly been using renewable diesel (also known as hydrotreated vegetable oil or HVO), for instance for Downton Abbey: A New Era. 
While this renewable biodiesel is less polluting than conventional diesel, it is not a panacea.
Producing HVO requires a great deal of vegetable oil, which worries environmental groups, who argue that making biofuels like HVO could be diverting crops for food into energy production.
Some HVO is made from waste, including used cooking oil and animal fats. But these oils and fats are in short supply as they are used in other products, like pet food.
""HVO production just adds to the demand for these scarce feedstocks,"" says Maik Marahrens, who campaigns on biofuels and energy at the European NGO Transport & Environment. 
Ms Smith acknowledges that renewable diesel isn't a perfect solution. 
In this transitional period, she's encouraging the hybrid use of batteries with other types of power. ""Battery technology has come on super-fast in the UK in the last couple of years, in terms of the availability and the size and the capacity,"" she says. 
ws productions to co-ordinate their power systems, with batteries connected to power-hungry generators, and generators turned off overnight. 
ries might be sufficient to power, for instance, the fridges and freezers that need to run overnight, with the generators turned on automatically in the morning. This results in less energy use overall.
Improvement of mobile batteries and solar-powered generators is a technological challenge.
But there's also what Ms Smith refers to as a ""hearts and minds challenge"", which is to convince crews that they can get by with less. 
""There's not a lot of room for error in film because everything moves so quickly,"" Ms Smith says.
For example, it may make sense for a gaffer (chief lighting technician) to transport extra lighting equipment just to ensure that no time is lost if a director changes her mind. 
""So yes, there's a lot of built-in redundancy, and it's a problem in terms of efficiency,"" Ms Smith notes. ""That is a difficult one to manage, because those people's jobs are at stake if they get it wrong.""
In this case, Ms Smith might encourage more data gathering to determine how much energy is actually being used, to allow for just a little spare capacity. Using small generators and switching equipment on only when needed would help to reduce energy waste.
More technology of business:
Given how electrical teams have embraced LED lights, which use less power than tungsten bulbs, Ms Smith is optimistic about other energy-use changes.
She can also combine the environmental argument with cost and health arguments when she's making suggestions to producers. 
rticularly true at the moment, with high fuel prices and, in the UK, an end to a tax exemption for off-road diesel use.
Ms Smith can make the argument:  ""We've saved this many litres of fuel, and that means this many tonnes of CO2.
""Your crew had much nicer air to breathe. They're not next to a diesel generator for 12 hours a day.""
If generators can be removed altogether, there's also the advantage of a quieter set. This was apparent back in 2013 while shooting the film Bad Words, which only used solar energy. But it has been difficult to replicate this in other productions, which may have greater energy needs or film outside sunny locations like Los Angeles.
One place that has taken up the regulation challenge is Vancouver. A multi-agency effort there has normalised the use of renewable energy in filmmaking.
Board of Parks and Recreation devised a strategy to move away from gas and diesel-powered generators. The City of Vancouver offers discounts on shooting fees to productions without diesel generators. And the Reel Green initiative has built a network of electric power kiosks near filming locations, as well as offering resources related to clean energy.
Hunter Vaughan, an environmental media scholar at the University of Cambridge, says that Sardinia and Majorca, like Vancouver, have also leveraged their popularity as filming locations, ""forcing mobile productions that shoot there to adopt sustainable practices"" that are better not only for the environment, but also for local communities. 
For faster change, more places will need to follow suit."	/news/business-62051070
politics	Penny Mordaunt: A very quick guide to the rising star who might be PM	"You might not know about Penny Mordaunt if you don't normally follow politics. Here's a quick recap of the MP's recent rise. 
Despite starting as a lesser-known candidate, she made it to the final three before losing out to Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss. She campaigned strongly for Brexit, but experts say she's trying to appeal to everyone in a very divided party.
rganise the process by which MPs can ask questions and debate issues in the House of Commons. At one point she had to explain Truss was not ""hiding under a desk"", when the prime minister didn't turn up to answer questions.
Some objected to her statements of support for trans rights while equalities minister. She later rowed back on them, saying ""if you've been in the Royal Navy, and you have competed physically against men, you understand the biological difference between men and women"".
Former Brexit minister Lord Frost said that when she was his deputy in negotiations, ""sometimes I didn't even know where she was"".
She was a navy reservist and was appointed the UK's first-ever female defence secretary by Theresa May - before being removed by Boris Johnson. Her father was a paratrooper and she is named after the cruiser HMS Penelope.
Other previous jobs include working in orphanages in Romania during her gap year. In 2014, while an MP, she appeared on ITV's Splash!, where she was mentored on diving by Tom Daley.
Also in 2014, she gave a speech on ""poultry welfare"" after a dare by her navy training officers. She later explained she had to ""say a particular word, the abbreviation of cockerel, several times during a speech on the floor""."	/news/uk-63345274
health	Cancer care delays: How bad are they in your area?	"re has been a sharp rise in long waits for cancer therapy in the past four years, BBC analysis shows.
umber waiting more than the 62-day target time for therapy in the past year has topped 69,000 across England, Northern Ireland and Scotland - twice as many as the same period in 2017-18.
Waits are also getting worse in Wales, but data does not go that far back.
You can find out how services are doing where you live with our local search tool.
It shows you what proportion of patients treated for cancer had to wait longer than 62 days.
Steven McIntosh, of Macmillan Cancer Support, told the BBC that the delays were ""traumatic"" and people were living ""day-by-day with fear and anxiety"". 
He said the situation was ""unacceptable"" and could even be having an impact on the chances of survival.
Describing the NHS as ""chronically short-staffed"", he said: ""The NHS doesn't have the staff it needs to diagnose cancer, to deliver surgery and treatment, to provide care, support and rehabilitation.""
Mr McIntosh warned there would be further delays and disruption if NHS spending did not at least rise in line with inflation in the chancellor's November budget. 
Meanwhile, latest monthly data from NHS England showed a further deterioration in emergency care and another rise in the hospital waiting list.
Charlotte Park is one of the cancer patients who has faced a long wait for treatment. She went to see her GP in June 2020 after finding a lump in her breast. 
Her GP gave her an urgent referral to the local breast clinic. Ms Park, 50, from North Yorkshire, should have been seen within two weeks, but when that passed she phoned only to be told there was a backlog.
Eventually she got an appointment after three-and-a-half weeks, but only after going back to her GP to see if they could help her get seen.
She was then diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer, but had to wait until September to start chemotherapy. 
Fortunately, she is now in remission.
But she said: ""It was so frustrating. I just felt like I was hitting my head against a brick wall. I felt under a massive amount of stress.""
""I thought I was going to die at one point. You worry so much when you are waiting. Sadly there are so many people out there is this position.""
Macmillan has also raised concerns there could still be potentially thousands of missing cases.
umber of diagnoses since the start of the pandemic is more than 30,000 lower than would have been expected. 
Disruption to services at the start of the pandemic and people not coming forward with symptoms because of fear of Covid or not wanting to burden the NHS has been blamed for this.
Recent data shows the numbers being referred in for cancer checks is now increasing and is at record levels.
But, as the analysis on waiting times for treatment shows, problems are still been seen in getting those patients treated quickly.
BBC looked at the latest data for waits for treatment to start following an urgent referral from a GP, although the figures in Scotland also included those identified via screening or during a visit to A&E.
reatments include surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Investment in testing - a network of 90 community diagnostic centres has opened in England - is expected to speed up diagnosis.
However, cancer experts says the key bottleneck that needs addressing is the wait after that treatment with staffing shortages seen as a key problem.
Royal College of Radiologists says there is a 17% shortfall in the UK in cancer doctors who oversee chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
""Staff is the key to fixing this,"" Tom Roques, of the Royal College, said. ""We desperately need a fully-funded workforce plan for the NHS that will recruit and retain the right numbers of staff that will be able to treat patients as quickly as we would all like.""
Labour shadow health secretary Wes Streeting, who has had kidney cancer but is now free of the disease after having one kidney removed, said: ""It is terrifying that so many cancer patients are not being treated on time, when every day matters.
""Having been through treatment for kidney cancer this year, I know the importance of an early diagnosis and fast treatment."" 
But Dame Cally Palmer, national cancer director for the NHS in England, said the ""hard work"" of staff was helping the system to catch up in terms of getting people in for checks.
But she said she was determined to ensure improvements were made in terms of diagnosis and treatment.
""We will not stop in our efforts to catch cancers earlier and save more lives.""

technology	Elon Musk at Twitter: Who could replace him as chief executive?	"Elon Musk is considering his next steps after a Twitter poll asking if he should step down as chief executive.
More than 17 million people had their say - with 57.5% voting yes - leaving the next obvious question being, if not Mr Musk, who?
re, who has been at the helm of the social platform since October, said he would abide by the results of the poll.
But he has not made any announcements regarding plans to leave his position.
""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive,"" he tweeted following the poll.
Bob O'Donnell, from TECHnalysis Research, warned that trying to predict who might take over the social platform was a ""pointless exercise because of how unpredictable and short-lived every decision"" regarding Twitter has been in the Musk era. 
Even so, we take a look at who might be in the running.
Mr Musk's poll was posted just hours after he was seen at the Lusail Stadium in Qatar, where he watched Argentina beat France on penalties to win the men's football World Cup.
He was at the game alongside Jared Kushner, a former US presidential adviser and Donald Trump's son-in-law. 
ures of the men flooded Twitter, with viewers questioning their relationship. Could he be Mr Musk's latest recruit?
A close confidante of Mr Musk is Sriram Krishnan, an Indian technocrat who was tasked by the billionaire to monetise the platform.
He is one of the few to be included in Mr Musk's core team at Twitter. 
Mr Krishnan, who is a former Twitter, Meta and Microsoft employee, is also an investor, technologist and engineer who hosts a podcast and YouTube channel with his wife. 
""I invest and am interested in the intersection of consumer tech and crypto,"" he says on his website. 
He lists pro wrestling as one of his interests and believes in ""the importance of making a big entrance"" - something that perhaps chimes with Mr Musk. 
gy investor and podcaster David Sacks is another one of the experienced names in Mr Musk's inner circle. 
Mr Sacks was involved at the beginning of PayPal with Mr Musk and is a member of the so-called ""PayPal Mafia"" - a group of former executives of the firm who have become billionaires by founding some of Silicon Valley's most successful tech businesses.
Co-founder of Twitter Jack Dorsey has stepped in to run it twice, so could it be third time lucky?
Arguably, there is nobody who knows the platform better than Mr Dorsey, who resigned as chief executive in November 2021.
He had been serving as chief executive of both Twitter and payment firm Square and had been under pressure from investors, who felt Twitter was not getting the focus it needed while he was also running Square.
Mr Dorsey not only extricated himself from Twitter but he also gave up his board seat - so has had no known involvement under Mr Musk apart from initially being supportive of his takeover.
Ms Friar was previously finance boss at Square, the payments company set up by Mr Dorsey. She is now the chief executive of Nextdoor, a social network that centres around local neighbourhoods. 
She has been described as one of the ""most highly regarded"" executives in Silicon Valley with an ""exceptionally rare mix of proven business skills, and authentic heart and soul"".
Another member of the ""PayPal Mafia"", Mr Marcus is the former president of PayPal and is close to Mr Musk. He was one of the first tech leaders to embrace cryptocurrencies. 
He was previously a top-ranking executive at Facebook's parent company Meta, heading up the firm's cryptocurrency project Diem and Messenger. He was also on the board of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange platform.
He now runs crypto-focused company Lightspark which is working on ""extending the capabilities"" of bitcoin.
If Mr Musk's future plans for making profits from Twitter include integrating cryptocurrency into existing  products and services, then Mr Marcus might be a leading candidate. 
Formerly the chief operating officer of Meta and Mark Zuckerberg's righthand woman, Sheryl Sandberg resigned from the role in June to focus on her philanthropic work.
She was seen as largely transforming Facebook's revenue strategy, positioning the platform to make profits from small business advertising and being at the helm during its meteoric rise. 
Could the top job at Twitter tempt her back into one of the biggest roles in Silicon Valley?
When Mr Musk completed his takeover of Twitter, he immediately sacked the former boss Parag Agrawal, co-founder Mr Dorsey's handpicked successor.
His sacking marked the beginning of the chaotic Musk era - so might Mr Musk want some stability and bring him back? 
One of the only people to throw their hat into the ring, albeit jokingly, is Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency whistleblower.
Mr Snowden has been living in exile in Russia since he leaked details of extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence agencies.
But given his espionage charges in the US, it would seem running Twitter would be rather difficult from Moscow.

entertainment	Sacheen Littlefeather: Native American activist and actor who refused Oscar for Brando dies	"Sacheen Littlefeather, the Native American activist who declined Marlon Brando's Oscar for The Godfather on his behalf in 1973, has died aged 75.
ress, who had breast cancer, died on Sunday, the Academy announced.
Her death comes two weeks after the organisation honoured her at a ceremony in Los Angeles, publicly apologising for her treatment at the Oscars.
Littlefeather, of Apache and Yaqui heritage, was booed while speaking on stage at the event 50 years ago.
Dressed in full Apache attire during the first Oscars to be televised around the world, the Californian, born Maria Cruz, explained on Brando's behalf that he would not accept his best actor gong for the mafia movie in order to protest against the treatment of Native Americans by the film industry and to bring attention to the Wounded Knee protests.
In 1973, several hundred locals, together with radical activists from the American Indian Movement (AIM), poured into the nearby village of Wounded Knee in South Dakota to protest government abuse.
rotest resulted in a violent stand-off with federal agents that went on for 71 days.
""I went up there, like a proud Indian woman with dignity, with courage, with grace, and with humility,"" she remembered at the recent event.
""I knew that I had to speak the truth. Some people may accept it. And some people may not.""
Screen Actors Guild member Littlefeather struggled to get work in the industry afterwards but said it was ""never too late for an apology... it's never too late for forgiveness.""
At the gala event at the Academy last month, Littlefeather appeared on stage in a wheelchair, laughing and entertaining the crowd, which included many Native and indigenous people working in the film industry. 
""I didn't represent myself. I was representing all indigenous forces out there. All indigenous people. Because we have never been heard in that way before,"" she told the BBC when asked about her speech at the Oscars nearly 50 years ago. 
Apache actress and activist said she faced decades of harassment for making that speech. 
""Somebody had to do it. And it was okay. And I had to pay the price.""
xt time a Native American makes a political Oscars speech it will likely be when they accept their own Academy award. The rules were changed after Littlefeather's speech and winners are now banned from sending someone else to collect, or reject, their statuette.   
In a recent interview with Variety, Littlefeather recalled the moment she walked off the stage in 1973.
""I was met with the stereotypical tomahawk chop, individuals who called at me, and I ignored all of them,"" she recalled. ""I continued to walk straight ahead with a couple of armed guards beside me, and I held my head high and was proud to be the first Indigenous woman in the history of the Academy Awards to make that political statement. 
""At that time in 1973, there was a media blackout on Wounded Knee and against the American Indian Movement that was occupying it,"" she went on. ""Marlon had called them in advance and asked them to watch the Academy Awards, which they did.
""As they saw me, up on stage, refusing that Academy Award for the stereotypes within the film industry, and mentioning Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it would break the media boycott.""
In 2020, Littlefeather told the BBC that straight after the speech she had to leave the stage with two security guards. But, she added, it ""was a very good thing"" as actor John Wayne was backstage. She said he was ""furious with Marlon and furious with me"" and wanted to pull her off stage himself.
Littlefeather featured in films like The Trial of Billy Jack, Johnny Firecloud and Counselor at Crime, but said she returned to San Francisco after being blacklisted by the industry, to continue her activism and work in health care and the theatre.
Paying tribute online on Monday, Dakota/Lakota Sioux writer and biologist Ruth H. Robertson, aka Red Road Woman, pointed to Littlefeather's work with the American Indian Aids Institute of San Francisco.
Lakota Man on Twitter offered: ""It's with a heavy heart that I mourn the passing of Sacheen Littlefeather. I wish her a blessed journey"", later adding: ""Honour her"".
V writer Joey Clift said: ""When I talk about how our current Native storytelling movement in Hollywood is built on the shoulders of activists fighting tirelessly for decades for Native people to finally get our day in the sun, I'm talking about Sacheen Littlefeather. RIP.""
In announcing her death online, the Academy quoted Littlefeather, the subject of the 2021 documentary, Sacheen: Breaking the Silence, saying: ""When I am gone, always be reminded that whenever you stand for your truth, you will be keeping my voice and the voices of our nations and our people alive."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63114459
technology	TikTok blamed by filmmaker for allowing abusive comments on video	"A video on TikTok about sexual consent has been swamped with comments from men accusing women of alleging assault.
Many of them mention Andrew Tate, the controversial influencer who has been banned from several platforms for his misogynist views.
wo-minute video, from an account with about 1,700 followers, has been viewed more than 1.2 million times.
Its creator Emmeline Hartley believes TikTok's algorithms are driving more hateful comments towards the film.
People using TikTok are served content based on a mixture of videos they have previously liked, and on which people like them have watched and commented.
kTok said misogyny was prohibited on the platform. 
""Our community guidelines specifically call it out as a hateful ideology and we are crystal clear that we do not want that content on our platform,"" said a spokesperson.
It added that it had removed more than 100 comments from Ms Hartley's video, which it said was a small proportion of the number that had been left. 
Ms Hartley said she had found it impossible to make direct contact with someone from the platform to get help.
""We don't have the capacity or the manpower to respond to all the comments,"" Ms Hartley said.
Her intention was to present a complicated but common scenario about sexual consent but she said she was concerned to see the film being used by some of those commenting as an example of women ""tricking"" men.
""I thought, 'what have I done? I've made a film that's helping rape culture'.""
She says she has seen other videos on TikTok that have been swamped with abusive comments where the creator is appealing for likes and positivity to help ""pull them back from the wrong side of TikTok"".
Ms Hartley's original video, Keep Breathing, was 18 minutes long and made in 2018, with funding from various local organisations in Derby and backed by the British Film Institute.
It is a fictional story featuring a couple arguing in a lift about a previous sexual encounter, interwoven with flashbacks to the evening it took place.
racters had both been drinking alcohol, they met in a nightclub, and there were misunderstandings about how they were going to get home and whether the man was going to stay with the woman. 
However, the clip she posted to TikTok in September featured only the pair's argument and not the contextual flashbacks. When Ms Hartley tried to add a separate video featuring those, they were repeatedly removed by TikTok on the grounds that they were explicit.
She has now been able to share the context, but says there are still many comments which are abusive towards women.
Although she considered removing the videos, Ms Hartley says she is content that she decided to share the post.
""I don't regret it, but I'm trying to navigate how to respond,"" she said.
""Some of the comments have been healthy, a couple of people have changed their minds while replying to each other. I think it's important, it needs to go out there.""
Social media consultant Matt Navarra said that TikTok's algorithm functions as a recommendation service, drawing both on the previous activity of the individual user and others like them, in order to serve up new content with which the person is also likely to engage. 
keeps them on the platform for longer and more frequently, which is good for advertisers and therefore also good for TikTok's advertising revenue.
""It means if this content has been seen, engaged with and liked by a group of users who are, for example, Andrew Tate fans, then it's likely to show that piece of content to even more people who are that sort of user,"" he said. ""It's self perpetuating.""
reator cannot stop this train once it is in motion, because they have no control over the algorithm itself and there are limited options for reporting issues, Mr Navarra added.
In July it was reported that Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, was going to make its algorithm more similar to TikTok's, rather than prioritising content from accounts that individuals were already following. "	/news/technology-63243423
politics	Warning of 'double digit' Welsh council tax increases as funding announced	"Plaid Cymru says local authorities face ""double digit"" council tax increases after the Welsh government announced their funding for next year.
Council funding will rise by 7.9% on average, with Monmouthshire getting the largest increase and Blaenau Gwent the smallest.
Welsh Labour government said it was prioritising frontline public services.
But council leaders said the increase only covers half of the gap of funding they face.
Plaid said the announcement falls ""way short of what's needed"", while the Conservatives called for councils to dig into reserve pots of cash.
One council leader warned services would have to be cut to avoid council tax rises of 10% and higher.
Wales' 22 local authorities operate schools, collect bins, run social care and libraries, among other services.
Councils do not get all their money from the Welsh government, with other sums coming from fees and council tax.
If council leaders cannot find ways of meeting their costs from their funding, they may look to raise council tax, or find ways of making savings by cutting services.
Before Wednesday's announcement Newport council is reported to have proposed a council tax rise of 9.5%, with cuts to bin collections and libraries.
It comes a day after the Welsh government announced its budget for the year, where ministers warned of a ""perfect storm"" facing the public services it supports.
r of the organisation that represents councils said the Â£5.5bn to local authorities from the Welsh government was more than had been expected, based on extra funding the UK government had given to Wales in the Autumn Statement.
But Andrew Morgan of the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said: ""The economic outlook remains bleak which means that councils will still have to take difficult decisions to meet spiralling budget gaps due to energy bills, inflation and pay costs.""
WLGA added that councils would look ""at council tax levels, income generation and the way services are provided, as part of councils' statutory duty to set balanced budgets"". 
It said the announcement ""covers just over half of the Â£784m budget gap in local government"".
Llinos Medi, Plaid Cymru leader Anglesey council, warned that local services will have to be cut to avoid a double digit increase in council tax at her authority. 
""If we didn't make any cuts to services, we'd look at 14% as an increase in council tax, and we couldn't do that.""
She added: ""I just feel like public services have been burnt, and we're down to the ashes now.""
One authority - Rhondda Cynon Taf - is going to consultation on a 3.5% increase, alongside savings. Torfaen has committed to a 2% rise.
Monmouthshire will receive the largest rise in funding of 9.3%, rising to Â£122m, while Blaenau Gwent's funding will rise by 6.5% to Â£139m.
BBC Wales was told that the funding decisions are made according to a formula that ""considers the relative demographic, physical, economic, and social characteristics of each area"", and that Blaenau Gwent receives the most funding per person of all the local authorities.
Finance and Local Government Minister Rebecca Evans said: ""This settlement builds on improved allocations in recent years and provides local authorities with a stable platform on which to plan their budgets for the coming financial year and beyond.
""When I announced our budget yesterday I prioritised the protection of frontline public services, and this increased funding to councils - who deliver so many of these services - is a vital part of that.'""
Some people in Newport market told BBC Wales they saw how hard it was for councils right now - in the same way that they face increasing costs.
Rhiannon Ash, 36, said: ""It's an issue that's affecting everything at the moment - the cost of everything is going up.
""So I can see why the councils would be feeling that pressure but obviously so are residents at the same time and nobody can really afford extra money for anything at the moment.""
Amy Harrison, 32, said: ""I think it's hard for councils as well but it just stings everyone else who's working and trying hard all the time.""
Sam Rowlands, council spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""I welcome the funding settlements for councils that bares a degree of reflection to the substantial usable reserves held by some councils.
""It is worth repeating these calls as the hundreds of millions of reserves could certainly be put to better use delivering frontline services to local people.""
Plaid Cymru Senedd spokesman for finance and local government, Llyr Gruffydd, added: ""This settlement is the price of the UK government's decision to impose austerity on Wales. It falls way short of what's needed to stave off big increases in council tax and further cuts to services. It is going to cost livelihoods and it is going to cost lives.
""Whilst any additional support is welcome, some parts of Wales will now be facing double digit council tax increases. It also means that after a decade of Westminster-driven cuts our key local services will have to contract further and even be lost altogether."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63970857
business	Cost of living: Rise in food export curbs sparks concerns	"Malaysia says it will cut the export of chickens from the start of June because of shortages in the country.
Elsewhere in Asia, India has banned wheat exports, while Indonesia blocked overseas sales of palm oil.
It comes as the world faces the worst food crisis in decades following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
One agriculture expert has highlighted concerns about the potential rise of so-called ""food nationalism"" by governments in the region.
Malaysian shoppers have seen chicken prices surge in recent months, while some retailers have put limits on how much of the meat customers can buy.
On Monday, Malaysia's Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the South East Asian country will stop exporting as many as 3.6m chickens every month ""until domestic prices and production stabilise"".
""The government's priority is our own people,"" he said in a statement.
Neighbouring Singapore, where Malaysian imports account for around a third of its chicken supplies, looks set to be hit especially hard by the move.
Almost all the birds are imported live before they are slaughtered and chilled in Singapore.
Later on Monday, the Singapore Food Agency encouraged shoppers to buy frozen chicken and moved to discourage panic-buying.
""While there may be temporary disruptions to the supply of chilled chicken, frozen chicken options remain available to mitigate the shortfall,"" the agency said in a statement. ""We also advise consumers to buy only what they need.""
Malaysia's chicken export ban is the latest development in the global food crisis.
Last month, the World Bank warned that record rises in food prices could push hundreds of millions of people into poverty and low nutrition.
Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat and its output has plunged since Russia invaded the country.
used a surge in global wheat prices. It has also raised the prospect of shortages in the countries which depend on its exports.
On Monday, Yuliia Svyrydenko, the first deputy prime minister of Ukraine, told the BBC that the international community should create a ""safe passage"" to enable millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country.
Also speaking to the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, David Beasley, executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme, called Russia's blockage of Ukraine's food exports ""a declaration of war on global food security"". 
""We are already facing the worst food crisis since World War II,"" he said.
""When you take 400 million people that are fed by the food that comes out from Ukraine and you shut that off, and then you add on top of that fertiliser problems, droughts, food costs, fuel costs, we're looking at a hellstorm on earth,"" Mr Beasley added. 
Wheat prices climbed again earlier this month after India banned exports of the staple cereal. The decision by the Indian government came after a heatwave in the country drove domestic prices to a record high. 
With droughts and floods threatening crops in other major producers, commodity traders had been expecting supplies from India to make up for part of the shortfall from Ukraine.
Palm oil prices also surged in recent weeks when Indonesia, the top producer of the ingredient used in everything from processed food to soap, stopped exports for three weeks to bring down local prices of cooking oil. The ban was lifted on Monday.
re examples of ""food nationalism"", according to Sonia Akter, an assistant professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.
""Governments impose such restrictions because they feel that they have to protect their citizens first and foremost,"" she said.
""From the previous experience of the 2007-2008 food crisis, it is expected that more and more countries will follow suit, which will exacerbate the crisis as well as the food price inflation,"" she added.
However, Professor William Chen of Singapore's Nanyang Technological University believes the export restrictions are just temporary in nature rather than fully-fledged food nationalism.
""Other countries have imposed bans on food commodities but lifted the ban later on,"" said Mr Chen, who is a director of the university's food science and technology programme.
""This is a good reflection of the interconnectivity of the food value chain, [where] no country can really depend on itself for all foods needed for their population.""

health	Government to sue Mone-linked PPE firm for Â£122m	"government is suing a company that supplied it with personal protective equipment (PPE) for Â£122m plus costs.
PPE Medpro won contracts through the so-called VIP lane in 2020, after being recommended by Tory peer Baroness Mone.
government is attempting to get its money back on one of the deals in the High Court, claiming the medical gowns supplied ""did not comply with the specification in the contract"". 
PPE Medpro said it would ""rigorously"" defend the claim.
mpany accused the government of a ""cynical attempt"" to recover money from suppliers who had acted in good faith and to contract specifications. 
government says along with the Â£122m contract, it has so far spent Â£6.9m on storage costs for the kit and each week it costs over Â£61,000 to store the gowns. It estimates the cost to dispose the gowns would be Â£4.7m.  
According to legal documents seen by the BBC, the government claims the ""the gowns did not comply with the specification in the contract"" and could not be used in the NHS. It also accuses PPE Medpro of a ""breach of contract and unjust enrichment"". 
A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that we have commenced legal proceedings in the High Court against PPE Medpro Limited for breach of contract regarding gowns delivered under a contract dated 26 June 2020. 
""We do not comment on matters that are the subject of ongoing legal proceedings.""
Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""After nearly a year of hiding behind a mediation process with a company linked to one of their own peers, Conservative ministers have finally been shamed into action to recover taxpayers' money after damning revelations, public outcry and Labour pressure.
""Time will now tell if the shoddy contracts they drew up are sufficiently robust to retrieve the public money they carelessly handed over.""
government has previously described the PPE Medpro medical gowns deal as an ""underperforming"" contract. 
In a statement, the company said it was clear by the end of 2020 that the government had ""vastly over-ordered"" PPE and would never be able to use it all.
It said consultants had been brought in to ""pick over all the contracts"" on ""technicalities"".
""PPE Medpro will demonstrate to the courts that we supplied our gowns to the correct specification, on time and at a highly competitive price,"" the company said.
""The case will also show the utter incompetence of DHSC to correctly procure and specify PPE during the emergency procurement period.""
mpany said while it was examining the allegations made by the government it refuted all of them and said its case would ""seek to dismantle"" them and ""make uncomfortable reading for both the government and DHSC"".
government revealed last year that Baroness Mone was the ""source of referral"" for PPE Medpro getting a place on the so-called VIP lane for PPE offers coming from ministers, officials or peers. 
In other words, she recommended the company.
VIP lane offers were treated with greater urgency and were 10 times more likely to result in contracts than offers being made outside this route.
Baroness Mone contacted Lord Agnew, the Cabinet Office minister, about the firm and he directed the offer to the VIP lane.
She is taking a leave of absence from the House of Lords, meaning she will not sit as a Conservative peer. She says she wants to clear her name amid allegations she benefitted from the contracts.
In December 2020, lawyers for Baroness Mone said she ""had no role or function in PPE Medpro, nor in the process by which contracts were awarded to PPE Medpro"".  
House of Lords commissioner for standards has launched an investigation into her ""alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro"". 
But the Commissioner's website says his investigation has been paused while the matter is investigated by the police or another agency as part of a criminal investigation. "	/news/uk-politics-64029040

m of Sam Barkley, Adam McKeown, Ian McClure and Martin McHugh stormed to an early lead and never looked back.
It is NI's second gold medal of Birmingham 2022 after Para-swimmer Bethany Firth's win on Wednesday.
In the men's singles Ballymoney's Gary Kelly took silver after defeat by Australian Aidan Wilson in the final.
men's fours win is made more remarkable by the fact that it comes 24 years after McClure and McHugh formed part of the team that claimed gold in the same event at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.
r two 2022 team-mates Barkley and McKeown, who were not born when they accomplished that feat, joined forces with the experienced duo to claim a magnificent, thumping win at a sun-kissed Victoria Park in Royal Leamington Spa.
NI were 7-0 up after four ends and were able to control the contest from there with India never to come within five of their dominant opposition.
Kelly advanced to the gold medal match of the men's singles with a 21-15 semi-final win over Malaysia at the Commonwealth Games, in doing so guaranteeing NI's 17th medal of a record-breaking Games.
However he came up against an inspired final opponent in Australia's Wilson, who completely dominated the gold medal match to take a resounding 21-3 win in just over an hour.
Wilson was the clear standout player in the men's singles draw having earlier dispatched of Scotland's Iain McLean in similar fashion.
But McLean went on to take bronze after a brilliant display of control and poise against Fairul Izwan Abd Muin of Malaysia saw him run out the 21-11 winner."	/sport/commonwealth-games/62449794
business	Train strikes: Passengers told to avoid travel on Saturday	"Passengers should avoid travelling by train unless absolutely necessary on Saturday due to expected widespread disruption from strikes, the rail industry has said.
Unions are striking as part of a long-running series of disputes over jobs, pay and conditions.
Only a fifth of trains are set to run on Saturday, with services starting late and finishing early.
RMT union members in 15 rail companies and Network Rail will strike.
ghth day of action taken by the union over pay and conditions.
will be joined by members of the TSSA union, who staff station ticket offices and work in on-board operational roles, affecting Avanti West Coast, c2c and Transpennine Express services.
Disruption is set to continue into Sunday morning.
National Rail Enquiries warned customers that it is ""inevitable that services will be cancelled or severely disrupted"".
""There will be a very limited service on Saturday 8 October with no service at all in some places. Please only travel by train if your journey is absolutely necessary, plan ahead and check before you travel.""
Passengers with advance, off-peak or anytime tickets affected by the strikes can use their ticket on Friday, or up to and including three days later, rail operators said.
People can also change their tickets to travel on an alternate date or get a refund if their train is cancelled or rescheduled.
RMT strikes will be widespread due to Network Rail's signalling staff striking across England, Scotland and Wales, so even where train operators are not directly involved in the dispute, only a fraction of usual services will run.
For example, the last direct train from Newcastle to London will leave at 13:53 and the last train from London to Nottingham will go at 16:32.
re will be no trains between London and Edinburgh, with passengers having to travel via Glasgow. Nor will there be any direct services between London and Norwich.
Separately, there will be further strikes on Monday in Scotland after the RMT rejected a 5% ScotRail pay offer which it described as a ""kick in the teeth"".
ScotRail warned of ""significant disruption"" to services, saying it would run ""very limited"" services on just three lines on the day.
rains will only run between 07:30 and 18:30, with two an hour between Milngavie and Edinburgh via Bathgate, and one train an hour between Glasgow and both Lanark and Larkhall.
RMT said more than 40,000 railway workers would take part in the action on Saturday. 
In an open letter to Transport Secretary Anne Marie Trevelyan, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch suggested the ongoing dispute would cost the government more than Â£100m.
government should ""unshackle"" the train operators, he wrote, suggesting the Department for Transport's role in the strike was blocking the path to a settlement.
Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA union, described workers' demands as ""reasonable"", saying his members deserved a pay rise after several years of pay freezes.
""We urge employers and government to bring forward talks to find a resolution to the concerns that rail workers have over pay, conditions and job security,"" Mr Cortes said.
On Wednesday, Ms Trevelyan told the BBC she wanted unions and train operators to ""come together and find something that we can all live with"".
She continued ""nothing is ever perfect, negotiations are compromises, but what we need is for our customers, our passengers to be at the centre of everyone's decision making.""
Since taking up her post last month, the transport secretary has met the leaders of the RMT and Aslef unions. She also told the BBC she would also meet the train companies over the next few weeks."	/news/business-63170168
politics	NHS Wales cash likely to fall short, research says	"Health funding is unlikely to be enough to cope with the post-pandemic pressures facing the Welsh NHS, finance experts have said.
Higher-than expected inflation has dealt a ""significant hit"" to spending plans, says a report that presents a ""gloomy backdrop"" for the economy.
It comes a week before the Welsh government publishes its next budget.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt topped up funding for Wales in his autumn statement.
was largely because of extra spending on the NHS in England - but high rates of inflation could cost the Welsh government Â£1.4bn over two years.
Wales Fiscal Analysis report from Cardiff University said if all the extra funding was passed on to the Welsh health service, NHS funding would grow about 2.4% over three years - less than the 2.7% the Welsh government was planning for.
""Spending will likely fall short of the funding pressures felt by the health service in the aftermath of the pandemic,"" the report said.
In its last budget, the Welsh government said dealing with a backlog of treatments, caused by Covid lockdowns, was its ""highest priority"".  
But waiting times have continued to rise this year. 
Spending plans for next year will be published by Finance Minister Rebecca Evans on 13 December.
ghter spending will also make it difficult to continue with payments from the Welsh government to ease the cost-of-living crisis.
Ministers also face difficult decisions over public sector pay, with nurses and ambulance staff due to go on strike.
Report author Guto Ifan said inflation had ""eaten into the real value"" of the government's spending plans, leaving it facing ""an incredibly difficult outlook"".
""We think given the increased costs on public service and public service employers that's going to fall short of the post-pandemic spending pressures and funding pressures that the NHS is facing,"" he said.
His team estimates a 1p increase in all income tax bands would raise Â£275m next year.
Despite Welsh Labour ruling out an income tax rise in its manifesto, Mark Drakeford said in October the case for a tax rise would be ""powerfully considered"". However since then Jeremy Hunt has scrapped the tax cuts promised in Liz Truss's mini budget."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63860672
technology	Holiday swindlers: The rise of digital travel scams	"Digital travel scams are a growing ""systemic and global"" problem, according to the World Tourism Organization, a branch of the UN. Dozens of Brazilian women have been finding this out the hard way, after paying for luxury holidays from a man whose Instagram account sparkles with opulent hotels and exotic locations.
Last December Maria (not her real name) decided to have a break from the heat of the Australian summer, and to take her family on a skiing holiday to Europe.
It was her first trip since the pandemic and she wanted it to be special. So she paid $20,000 to a travel agent, Rafael Bessa, a fellow Brazilian who had been recommended by a friend, and made the long flight north.  
gin with, everything was perfect, but as Maria checked out of the third hotel the manager told her the room had not been paid for. 
wo further shocks came in quick succession. When Maria contacted Rafael Bessa to ask for help, she noticed he was unable to talk to the hotel manager in French, despite his claim to have attended an exclusive boarding school in the Alps. Then, when the family boarded a train to their next destination, there was a problem with the tickets: he had provided two tickets with the same purchase number, meaning that only one was valid. 
At the next hotel it was a similar story: Maria had to settle the bill, even though she had paid in full already. 
Initially she had assumed Rafael Bessa was simply incompetent. ""Then I said, 'No, this is not a mistake, this is on purpose. This is in bad faith.'""
Altogether, Maria says she lost $30,000 on the holiday - $15,000 of the money she had paid in advance, plus an extra $15,000 for just one of the hotels. Maria says that as well as telling her he'd paid for the room, Rafael Bessa said he'd got her a free upgrade - but he hadn't, and the hotel charged the staggering full price for the super de luxe room.  
Rafael Bessa's promises of reimbursement came to nothing, Maria says. Although he sent her various ""proofs"" of money transfers, the cash never actually arrived in her account. 
, when she posted about her experiences on social media, she says his lawyer got in touch, offering to reimburse $20,000 as long as she signed a non-disclosure agreement. She refused. 
BBC asked Rafael Bessa to comment on Maria's allegations. He replied that there had been an unspecified ""problem"" with the price of one of the hotels, and that the room at this price had not been included in the package. He also sent copies of the train bookings - which, as Maria said, both bore the same purchase number. 
Another Brazilian woman, Ana Jalenna, booked an Alpine skiing trip and also an Italian summer holiday with Rafael Bessa, after he had organised a ""fantastic"" family holiday for her in Brazil.
She paid part of the bill in cash, and the plan was that he would put the rest on her credit card. Some time later, she was surprised to see a payment to British Airways appear on her card account and called him to ask about it. 
It was the payment for her Italian hotel, he told her. Finding this hard to believe, she emailed the hotel and was told no payment had been made.
Ana decided to ask Rafael Bessa for proof that he had at least made the bookings at the ski resort. He gave her two reservation numbers, but the hotel told her they were invalid. 
""I lost the money, the dream, the trip. I lost everything,"" she says.
She later spoke to other dissatisfied clients of Rafael Bessa's, and noticed a pattern.
""The first trip was fantastic and everything is OK,"" she says. ""And then he does a longer trip, a better trip with expensive hotels, and he does this to people.""
Rafael Bessa insisted to the BBC that he booked the Italian hotel. He said Ana cancelled the skiing trip, and he paid her back the money.
But Ana said she didn't cancel it - and wasn't reimbursed.
Holiday Swindler: The rise of digital travel scams
Social media is tempting people to sample the luxury holiday lifestyle, but what happens when it all goes wrong? This is the story of one Brazilian travel agent with a trail of unhappy clients around the world.
Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)
Maria and Ana were angry and scarred by their experience, but neither suffered financial hardship as a result.
For Adriane Trofin, a Brazilian working mother of two who lives in London, the failure of her dream family holiday to Greece this year was more traumatic.
She first came across Rafael Bessa on Facebook, captivated by his posts from beautiful locations, and struck up an online friendship. 
She explained that she couldn't afford that kind of holiday herself, but he replied that there were trips for every budget, and she ended up booking a dream holiday to Greece for 14 people in total - members of her family and a number of friends. 
Rafael Bessa in advance for the stay at a four-star Club Med resort, but the cars that should have met them at Athens airport didn't arrive.
Adriane messaged Rafael Bessa for help. He reassured her that everything had been booked, and gave her three telephone numbers for the car company, but she couldn't get through on any of them.
group was stranded for hours. Eventually, the airport operations manager for Club Med, David Doepfer, came to their assistance. He quickly established that there was no Club Med booking in Adriane's name. Rafael Bessa had once reserved rooms, he learned, but had not paid for them before the expiry date.
David called the travel agent and asked him to book a different hotel in Athens for the group, which he agreed to do. But David says that when he called the new hotel to check Rafael Bessa had stuck to his word he was told the rooms had not been paid for.
Adriane Trofin says her marriage is still badly shaken
In the end Adriane's husband paid for the entire group to stay in another hotel, at a cost of $8,500. 
""I spent that week, those seven days, discussing with Rafael day and night on the phone, trying to make him send at least a part of the money. He started to mock me,"" Adriane says. He also harassed other members of the group, she says, convincing some of them that the problem was Adriane's fault and that she owed him money.
""I was in hell. I had never faced a worse situation in my life, I never had anything worse in my life than those seven days in Greece.
""My marriage is still badly shaken by that. For me, it's a lot of money, you see? But it's no longer just about the money.""
She says the experience left her ""emotionally destroyed"".
Despite having assured Adriane, as she waited at the airport, that everything would be fine, Rafael Bessa told the BBC he had cancelled the hotel booking because Adriane had failed to pay everything she owed him.
But Adriane showed the BBC evidence of money transfers made before the trip covering the full cost of the hotel. She had agreed with Rafael Bessa to pay for three plane tickets in instalments, and was up to date with these payments - which Mr Bessa confirmed in screengrabs of messages he sent to the BBC.
BBC has spoken to 10 other clients of Rafael Bessa. Together with Maria, Ana and Adriane they say they paid him $90,000 for services that were not provided.
We also spoke to Brazilian lawyer Victor Penido Machado, who is bringing a case against Rafael Bessa on behalf of nearly 50 clients. They paid a total of $183,000 for hotel bookings and other services that were not delivered, he says.
A similar pattern is repeated again and again, the lawyer says. Clients arrive at their destinations, find a hotel has not been paid for, and are unable to get Rafael Bessa to pay them back. 
Approached by the BBC, Mr Bessa denied the allegations made by his former clients, saying he was ""shocked"".
""I'm really surprised by the amount of errors, 90% of your facts are false,"" he wrote.
UN's World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) says social media is increasingly being used by travel agents to persuade customers to buy a dream holiday - one that they too can look forward to posting on social media.
""Because they are being displayed on social media, tourists may have the perception that these services are more reliable than if they would find them on any regular website,"" says UNWTO legal counsel, Alicia Gomez.
At the same time, digital travel scams are on the rise all over the world, Ms Gomez says.
""This has become a global and systemic problem. Many national consumers and authorities are reporting an increase in online scams, and the number may be even higher as the shame and the guilt of tourists that fall for them discourage reporting.""
UNWTO has developed a code for the protection of tourists, which it says clarifies the responsibilities of social media companies, governments and consumers and describes how governments and private companies can best work together.
Seven countries have signed up to the code so far, making it part of their national legislation, while others, including Brazil, are in the process of doing so.
Meta, owner of Instagram and Facebook, told the BBC: ""We don't allow fraudulent activity on our platforms and work closely with law enforcement to support investigations and keep scammers out. 
""We continue to invest in new technologies and spent approximately $5bn last year alone on safety and security."" "	/news/world-63727404
sports	Tokyo Olympics: Joanna Muir on modern pentathlon Olympic hopes	"""You're watching people sword fight, people riding an unknown horse. You're seeing swimming, a great sport in itself..."" 
Without yet touching on the 'laser run' - a combination of 800m efforts and pistol shooting - to finish, Joanna Muir has already presented a compelling case for watching the modern pentathlon at the Olympics on Friday. Five sports. One day. Plenty of drama.
Part of the Olympics since 1912, 'modern' pentathlon is based on the pentathlon of the ancient Greek Olympiad and was set up precisely to test an athlete in all aspects - both physical and mental.
One of the key skills, it turns out, is horse whispering. For the riding, athletes are paired with an unknown horse 20 minutes before they complete nine to 12 jumps.
""Those 20 minutes are so important,"" Muir explains. ""It's finding the balance because it's really nerve-wracking - you've no idea what kind of horse you're going to get. 
""But you have to try to stay as calm as possible because the horse will be able to sense if you're uptight or nervous and you have to really get it to listen to you in those first 20 minutes.
""Some people try and take in some Polos and things. I try and get to the horse 10 minutes before, give it a bit of a pat and say hello to it.""
Muir, 26, is fortunately a natural when it comes to horses, having started out at Pony Club, which she did alongside a myriad of other sports, from lacrosse to athletics, in Dumfriesshire, where shew grew up.
Fencing was not one of them. At least initially. The ""sword fighting"" came after. Though rather than a swashbuckling duel, Muir explains it is more a battle of wits.
""There's so many tactics and it's very technical,"" she says. ""It's all about taking your time, being really composed and try and get your opponent to mess up and go for it. If you rush you're more likely to make a mistake.
""It's really cool and the discipline I started the latest so I've found it the hardest to grasp. But I feel like it's coming together now.""
riety in the event also begs the question: how do you train for five very different disciplines?
""We run five times a week - two of those are normal laser run sessions with the shooting - we swim four times, gym three times, ride once, fence two to three times,"" she replies. ""So it's very, very full on but I love that every day is different.""
Muir is ranked sixth in the world, which means she has a decent shot at a medal in her debut games. Having loved watching Dame Kelly Holmes and Sir Chris Hoy over the years, now it's her turn to pull on the Team GB kit.
Whatever happens in Japan, the moment she found out she was going to her first Olympics will stick with her.
""I was in the middle of a sports massage,"" Muir laughs. ""I knew we were going to get a call.
""I had my phone on loud but I hadn't told our soft tissue girl Jenny that I was expecting a phone call and and when my phone rang and I just jumped off the bed so quickly and was like, 'I need to take this, I'm so sorry'.
""So, it wasn't very glamorous but that's how I found out and I was obviously really emotional and excited.""
Just as thrilled is mum Susan, who racked up the miles taking Muir across the country as she made her way in the sport. It'll be family, friends and those back in her village, Haugh of Urr, who Muir hopes to do proud.
""I've received quite a few cards from people back home,"" she adds.
""I've had messages from people I've grown up with and others who've played a part in my journey. It's just so special and hopefully everyone will be watching."""	/sport/olympics/57841169

health	Nurses bitten and screens smashed - life in A&E	"Busy, noisy, highly stressful - and sometimes violent. This is the reality of A&E as the NHS gears up for what will be an incredibly difficult winter.
much is clear from the experience of staff and patients at Royal Berkshire Hospital's emergency department.
Like all units, it is struggling to see patients quickly - more than a third of patients wait more than four hours.
ress and frustration means tempers can easily boil over. 
Receptionist Tahj Chrichlow says it can get so busy patients end up ""packed like sardines"".
""Sometimes people can be not as nice to us as we like,"" he adds, explaining how earlier this week the window of the reception office had been smashed by one angry person.
""Luckily we have got a very nice security team who can come down and help us - they're pretty much on our speed dial, just in case.""
Staff nurse Harriet Nicholls ended up getting slapped and bitten on the arm as she and a colleague tried to put a drip in a patient. 
ual had dementia - so it was not necessarily related to the delays seeing patients - but such episodes were not uncommon in the department. 
""We're overloaded and there are not enough staff,"" she says.
figures show the emergency care system has never seen such huge pressures - certainly since modern recording-keeping began 20 years ago.
roportion of patients waiting more than four hours to be seen has reached its highest level ever with more than 30% of patients facing delays.
Ambulances are also facing record delays.
And for those patients who cannot be treated on the spot and need a stay in hospital, there can then be long waits for a bed.
One of those was Anne Whitfield-Ray who was taken to her local hospital last month after she fell at home and broke her hip.
She spent 15 hours on a trolley until a bed could be found for her.
""It was absolute chaos - like something out of a third world country,"" said the 77-year-old from Worcestershire. 
""Patients were being squeezed in everywhere they could. It was horrific.""
But she said that despite her experience she cannot fault the staff: ""They are doing the best they can.""
Hayley, 34, from Ashford in Surrey, had an even longer wait with her six-month-old. 
She was told to go straight to A&E by her GP after her baby became unwell.
""It was totally rammed. We spent 33 hours in A&E waiting for a bed on the wards. 
""The staff tried their best to help us. I can't complain about the care we've had as it's been very good. But the NHS is totally overwhelmed.""
Royal College of Emergency Medicine is warning delays like these are putting patients at risk.
Vice president Dr Ian Higginson says hospitals are ""full to bursting"".
""When our hospitals are full, we can't get patients out of our emergency departments.
""That means emergency departments become overcrowded and we see patients waiting for long periods on uncomfortable trollies in corridors or other rubbish places.""
Dr Higginson says his colleagues are ""very worried"" and unable to deliver the care they would like to give to patients.
""It's just not possible,"" he adds.
Dr Vin Diwakar, of NHS England, said staff were working ""round-the-clock"" to try to see and treat patients as quickly as they can.
He said the problems in A&E were caused by a lack of beds, with 19 out of every 20 currently occupied.
He said the ""fundamental challenge"" was the difficulty hospitals were facing discharging patients who were medically fit to leave, but could not be released because of a lack of care in the community.
Every day more than half of patients ready to be discharged cannot be discharged.
Dr Diwakar said steps were being taken, including investment in community teams to stop people ending up in hospital, 
A network of regional ""war rooms"" has also been created, he added, which monitor the pressures on local hospitals in real time, so they can try to manage demand by diverting ambulances away from the most under-pressure hospitals.

politics	Conservative MP for Kingswood to step down at next election	"Kingswood MP Chris Skidmore became the latest Conservative MP to announce he will not be standing in the next election.  
Mr Skidmore, 41, said ""there has been no greater honour in my life"" than representing the constituency in Parliament for the past 12 years. 
When boundaries change, the Kingswood constituency will cease to exist. 
MP said in a statement at the weekend he did not wish to stand elsewhere. 
Mr Skidmore was born and grew up in Kingswood, which sits on the eastern edge of Bristol.
""I do not wish to fight another constituency elsewhere in the region or the country, especially with a very young family who deserve to see more of their father in their lives,"" he said.
""I would like to thank local constituents for putting their trust and faith in me to serve as their local MP.""
Mr Skidmore signed the UK's net zero by 2050 commitment into law in 2019 while serving as Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation in Theresa May's government. 
For the past three months he has been leading a review of the government's delivery of its net zero targets. 
MP said that outside of Parliament, he hoped to continue to focus on tackling global warming.
""It is clear to me that net zero and tackling climate change will be the greatest challenge, yet also the greatest opportunity, of our generation,"" he said.
""It is this opportunity - to demonstrate how we must protect our environment and climate for the future, at the same time as delivering a new clean and sustainable energy system that shifts us away from fossil fuels - that I now wish to devote my attention to."" 
He added: ""Rather than step aside, I hope that in the future I can step up to continue to play my own small part in helping to deliver on the energy transition that the world needs.""
Mr Skidmore's announcement follows that of Dehenna Davison, the Conservative MP for Bishop Auckland.
29-year-old was elected as the County Durham constituency's first Tory MP in 2019.
Elsewhere, senior Conservative MP William Wragg, vice-chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, has said he will not run again.   
Conservatives Chloe Smith, MP for Norwich North, and Gary Streeter, MP for South West Devon, also announced last week they intended to stand down.

politics	Matt Hancock: Itâs a pleasure to be backâ¦ and well-fed	"former health secretary has appeared again in the Commons after several weeks in Australia.
Matt Hancock has returned to his day job as an MP after three weeks in the TV jungle as a contestant on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!
Mr Hancock was teased about his stint on the reality TV show as he made a speech in a near-empty House of Commons chamber.
He told MPs he was pleased to be back ""clean and well-fed"".
MP is trying to pass a law that would result in every child being screened for dyslexia in schools. 
former health secretary was suspended from the parliamentary Conservative Party after joining the ITV show, and now sits as an independent MP.
Some Conservative MPs poured scorn on Mr Hancock's jungle jaunt, among them Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who said he was ""very disappointed"" in the MP for West Suffolk.
Mr Hancock defended his absence from Parliament, insisting he wanted to ""show what I am like as a person"" and draw attention to issues such as dyslexia.
MP, who was diagnosed with dyslexia at university, said he would use the platform of I'm a Celebrity to raise awareness of the learning difficulty.
He was shown on camera doing so only a handful of times, including in his exit interview after he came third in the public vote on the show, which was filmed in Australia.
wo days after arriving back in the UK, Mr Hancock put the show's stomach-churning Bushtucker Trials behind him for a challenge of a political kind in Parliament.
Starting the debate on Mr Hancock's draft law - known as a bill - Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans joked: ""This is the third bill of the day and I know Mr Hancock you appear to be making a habit of coming third these days.""
In reply, Mr Hancock said: ""I am not quite sure what to make of that. But I am honoured to be third today and let's see how that goes.
""But it's also a pleasure to be here and to be clean and well-fed."" 
He said only one in five children are identified as dyslexic in schools, branding those figures a ""gaping hole"" in the government's drive to improve literacy standards.
He told MPs that early identification of dyslexia was essential to reach full literacy in the UK.
""The next stage of the education revolution under this administration must be to improve opportunities that dyslexic children and children with other neurodivergent conditions have,"" he said.
After wrapping up, Mr Hancock was followed by Labour's shadow education minister, Matt Western, who said he was happy to see the former cabinet minister ""here in the flesh"". 
""He may have felt at home in the last week few weeks among late-career popstars and soap legends,"" Mr Western said.
""But I'm sure what he's hoping to do here is far more important than the past few weeks.""
Mr Hancock's Dyslexia Screening and Teacher Training Bill ran out of time in Friday's sitting of the House of Commons.
ut forward is known as a private member's bill and is only given limited time to be debated and voted on by MPs. The bill will next be considered the Commons in March next year, but is unlikely to progress any further given the time constraints on MPs when debating such matters.
Mr Hancock's reappearance comes as speculation mounts over whether he will be reinstated as a Tory MP and seek to stand again at the next election.
Conservative vice-chair Nickie Aiken told the BBC she thought Mr Hancock should not be let back into the Conservative Party.
Allies of Mr Hancock say he intends to stay in politics.
Meanwhile, a serialisation of Mr Hancock's new book, Pandemic Diaries, is to be published by the Daily Mail on Friday.
former cabinet minister has also given an interview to the newspaper, telling them, among other things, about how he fell in love with his former aide, Gina Coladangelo."	/news/uk-politics-63838557

health	Ipswich and Colchester hospitals boss warns of Christmas challenge	"A boss of two East of England hospitals said it would be a ""challenging Christmas"" due to NHS pressures.
Nick Hulme, chief executive of Ipswich and Colchester hospitals, said the pressure across the health system was ""of a magnitude I haven't seen before"".
""There is a level of sickness, flu and Covid I've never seen in my career,"" he told BBC Radio Suffolk.
He urged people to think ""carefully"" about Christmas hospital visits, but said patients would be safe.
""We will continue with our amazing staff to make sure that those people who unfortunately do need to be in hospital will be safe and looked after,"" he said.
Mr Hulme said plans had been in place for the busy winter period since June.
He encouraged people to ""remember all the good advice"" about infection control, including washing of hands and keeping a safe distance.
""People think it's a cough or a cold, but for someone who's immunosuppressed or ill, flu can be fatal,"" he said.
""We need to protect the most vulnerable in our society and our families.""

entertainment	Brazilian music icon Gal Costa dies aged 77	"Gal Costa, one of the giants of Brazilian popular music, has died at the age of 77.
ger rose to fame in the 1960s when she spearheaded the TropicÃ¡lia movement alongside fellow stars Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso.
Her press team did not disclose the cause of her death.
Costa had recently had to cancel some concerts on doctor's orders after an operation, but had planned to return to the stage next month in SÃ£o Paulo.
g tribute to Costa on social media included President-elect Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, who called her one of the world's greatest singers. 
He said she was one of the main artists to put Brazil, and Brazilian music, on the world map.
""Her talent, technique and audacity enriched and renewed our culture, rocked and marked the lives of millions of Brazilians,"" he added.
Born in the north-eastern state of Bahia, a centre of Afro-Brazilian culture, Costa recorded more than 30 albums in her lengthy career.
Her best-known hits included Baby, Que Pena, Chuva de Prata and Divino Maravilhoso.
ger-songwriter lent her distinctive voice to a wide range of songs by authors including Tom Jobim, Chico Buarque and Milton Nascimento.
And during the years of Brazil's dictatorship, her trademark hippie style and often revealing clothing made her a symbol of defiance of the military authorities.
Gilberto Gil, who worked closely with Costa throughout both of their careers, said he was ""very sad and shaken by the death of my GaÃºcha sister Gal Costa"".
Costa was a vocal supporter of Lula throughout his recent presidential campaign. 
When news broke of his win in Brazil's presidential elections just two weeks ago, she posted a picture on Instagram with the caption: ""Love won against hate! President Lula!"""	/news/world-latin-america-63576952

""It's brilliant to be world champion again,"" said Ellis.
""It gets more difficult every time because everyone is gunning for you.
""You get a bit nervous about it, so to defend the title is awesome.""

""Hopefully I will come back stronger and fitter next year.""
Paralympic bronze medallist Cashmore faced a head-to-head battle with Norman for gold. She made an impressive start in the swim, before Norman recovered to take victory.
Britain's Alison Peasgood and guide Brooke Gillies won bronze in the PTVI women's event.
Former Olympic silver mediallist Peasgood missed eight weeks of training after brother-in-law George Peasgood suffered a brain injury in a training accident.

politics	NI election: Sinn FÃ©in says talks to be held on Tuesday	"Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy has said his party will meet the Northern Ireland secretary on Tuesday to discuss when a Stormont election will happen.
Chris Heaton-Harris has said he will call a poll but has not set a date.
He said he would hold another round of talks with the Stormont parties in the coming week before giving more details about a potential election.
But Phillip Brett of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said more discussions would be ""pointless"".
Devolved government in Northern Ireland has not functioned since February.
DUP has blocked the restoration of power-sharing in its protest against the post-Brexit trading arrangement known as the Northern Ireland Protocol.
rties had expected the Northern Ireland secretary to announce on Friday when an election would take place.
But Mr Heaton-Harris declined to set a date.
Speaking to BBC News NI on Saturday, Mr Murphy described the lack of an announcement as ""bizarre and unexpected"".
""We were as surprised by his U-turn as everyone else,"" said the former finance minister.
Chris Heaton-Harris denies he made a U-turn about calling an election
""We're not certain what's behind it... we have had no discussion with him at all and no advance warning of what he's going to do.
""I think that's the wrong way to do business.""
Mr Murphy said Sinn FÃ©in planned to meet Mr Heaton-Harris on Tuesday to understand what the Northern Ireland Office is ""actually doing"".
""What we want to know from the secretary of state is when [an election] is going to take place,"" he said.
Mr Brett of the DUP said he said he wanted the UK government to resolve his party's concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol.
It keeps Northern Ireland aligned with some EU trade rules to ensure that goods can move freely across the Irish land border.
Unionist parties argue that the protocol has undermined Northern Ireland's place within the UK by effectively creating a trade border with England, Scotland and Wales.
""We've been talking for two-and-a-half years - now is the time for action,"" said Mr Brett.
""We will not re-enter the executive until action is taken to replace the protocol with arrangements that have cross-community support.
""That is where the focus needs to be, not on pointless talks.""
rties had until Friday to form a functioning executive at Stormont but the DUP blocked that from happening.
Legislation states that an election must therefore be held within 12 weeks.
It had been expected that one would take place on 15 December.
Mr Heaton-Harris denied that he had made a U-turn, saying that a vote did not have to be called immediately.
Alliance Party MLA Kate Nicholl said she was relieved that a date for the poll had not been announced.
""We really hope that there won't be [an election] and that we can use this time to be constructive,"" she said.
""People need us to do our jobs and to work together - it's what we were elected to do.""
Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MP Clare Hanna said an election was now ""less likely"".
She said the Mr Heaton-Harris's decision not to declare a polling date on Friday had ""created space to think about what the actual impact of an election would be"".
""I think by common consensus it wouldn't be helpful,"" she said.
revious assembly election in May resulted in Sinn FÃ©in winning the most seats for the first time.
meant the party's vice-president Michelle O'Neill was entitled to the role of first minister.
DUP was the second-biggest party but it refused to nominate a deputy first minister, meaning a ruling executive for Northern Ireland could not be formed.
In the run-up to that election the DUP withdrew Paul Givan from the first minister post in protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63400016
technology	Starlink: Why is Elon Musk launching thousands of satellites?	"Elon Musk's SpaceX company has been launching thousands of satellites into orbit. Many people say they've seen them in the skies.  
're part of the Starlink project, which aims to provide high speed internet services from space, to remote areas on Earth. 
Starlink provides internet services via a huge network of satellites. 
It is aimed at people who live in remote areas who cannot get high-speed internet.
""There are people in the UK in that category, but more across the world, in places like Africa,"" says Dr Lucinda King, Space Projects Manager at the University of Portsmouth.
Starlink's satellites have been put in low-level orbit around the Earth to make connection speeds between the satellites and the ground as fast as possible.
However, a great many low-level satellites are needed to provide full coverage of the globe. 
It's thought Starlink has put some 3,000 of them into space since 2018. It may eventually use 10,000 or 12,000, says Chris Hall, editorial director of the technology website Pocket Lint.
""Using satellites solves the problem of getting internet connections to remote locations in deserts and mountains,"" he says.
""It bypasses the need to build massive amounts of infrastructure, like cables and masts, to reach those areas.""   
Compared to standard internet providers, Starlink isn't cheap. 
It charges customers $99 per month (Â£89 per month in the UK). The dish and router needed to connect to the satellites costs $549 (Â£529 in the UK). 
However, 96% of households in the UK already have access to high-speed internet, as do 90% of households in the EU and the US. 
""Most of the developed world is already well connected,"" says Professor Sa'id Mosteshar of London University's Institute of Space Policy and Law. ""They're relying on a small share of the market for revenues."" 
mpany says it has 400,000 subscribers in the 36 countries it currently covers - mostly in North America, Europe and Australasia. This is made up of both households and businesses.
Next year, Starlink plans to extend its coverage further across Africa and South America, and into Asia - regions of the world where internet coverage is more patchy.
""Starlink's prices may be too high for many households in Africa, say,"" says Chris Hall. ""But it could play an important role in connecting schools and hospitals in remote areas there."" 
As Russian forces have advanced in Ukraine they have closed down Ukrainian internet services and tried to block social media. 
Elon Musk made Starlink available in Ukraine immediately after the invasion started. About 15,000 of Starlink's sets of dishes and routers have been shipped to the country.
""Starlink has kept things going, like public services and government,"" says Chris Hall. ""The Russians haven't found a way of disabling it.""
It has also been used on the battlefield.
""Ukrainian forces are using it to communicate - for example, between headquarters and troops in the field,"" says Dr Marina Miron, defence studies researcher at Kings College London.
""Its signals cannot be jammed like ordinary radio signals can be, and it takes only 15 minutes to set up the kit.""
Starlink is not the only internet provider with satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO).
Amazon is planning to put thousands of its Kuiper satellites into LEO, and Oneweb is also putting satellites there. 
Putting satellites into low-Earth orbit could lead to problems, says Sa'id Mosteshar.
""Satellites could hit other vessels and create fragments of wreckage and these, in turn, could cause a lot more damage when flying at high speeds.""
re have recently been a number of near misses involving Starlink satellites, including near misses with China's space station. 
""If there are too many fragments, it could make low-Earth orbit unusable in the future,"" says Dr King of Portsmouth University. 
""And we may not be able to get out of low-Earth orbit into higher orbits, where our navigational satellites and telecoms satellites are situated.""
Starlink's satellites are also creating problems for astronomers. 
At sunrise and sunset, they are visible to the naked eye because the sun glints off their wings.
use streaks on telescope images, obscuring the view of stars and planets. 
Starlink says it is trying to reduce the brightness of its satellites in the sky. "	/news/technology-62339835
business	Pound rises and borrowing costs fall as chancellor moves to calm markets	"und rose and government borrowing costs fell on Monday, as investors welcomed the announcement by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt of the reversal of most of the mini-budget tax measures.
Sterling extended gains against the dollar, and is trading at around $1.14.
ws also saw the interest rate - or yield - on UK government bonds fall, making government borrowing less expensive.
However, analysts said tough decisions remained ahead on government spending.
An update to the government's mini-budget had been scheduled for 31 October, but Mr Hunt brought forward many billions of pounds worth of tax and spending measures in a bid to reassure the markets.
ges will see a planned cut in income tax scrapped, while a cap on energy bills that had been due to last two years is now only guaranteed until April next year, when it will be reviewed.
In a statement, the Treasury said the chancellor had ""taken these decisions to ensure the UK's economic stability and to provide confidence in the government's commitment to fiscal discipline"".
Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: ""Jeremy Hunt's focus on reassuring the markets and reinstating confidence appears to have worked so far with gilt yields trading lower and sterling pushing higher."" 
However, she added that question marks will remain until the chancellor outlines on 31 October how he plans to cut government spending ""in order to plug the multi-billion pound budget shortfall, raising concerns about the prospect of a new era of austerity"".
An utterly extraordinary unBudget - perhaps the biggest U-turn in British economic history.
Â£45bn of unfunded tax cuts has in three weeks and three days seen a Â£32bn reversal.
We may need new terminology. U-turn suggests a controlled manoeuvre. This is like a plane trying to do the jet engine equivalent of a handbrake turn.
But it will have real impacts, especially the decision to target the energy help after April.
re are reasonable questions now about higher taxes and less help as we enter a recession.
Much of this has been inevitable since the Monday after the mini-budget. It should help regain economic credibility.
But it is such a political volte face that one wonders if the whole cabinet, government and Conservative party will support it.
w chancellor's message will be this: there is no alternative.
On Friday, Prime Minister Liz Truss sacked Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor and said the mini-budget ""went further and faster than markets were expecting"".
mini-budget was blamed for causing turmoil in the financial markets, with the pound slumping to a record low of $1.03 and the cost of government borrowing rising sharply in its aftermath.
However, Friday's announcement of the Â£18bn U-turn on corporation tax and the firing of Mr Kwarteng did not appear to reassure investors, with UK government borrowing costs climbing on Friday afternoon.
re had been fears of more turmoil on Monday, with the UK government bond market trading for the first time since the end of the Bank of England's emergency support programme.
However, the news of the latest U-turn led to the cost of government borrowing falling across a range of bonds traded on the financial markets.
ue to be repaid in 30 years' time dropped on Monday morning as markets anticipated Mr Hunt would reverse tax cuts, and fell further after he did so in his statement, to 4.35%.
It had hit 5.17% on 28 September in the aftermath of the mini-budget.
However, the yield is still higher than it was before the mini-budget, when it stood at 3.7%.
""Markets seem prepared to give Jeremy Hunt the chance to turn back the clock,"" said Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell. ""The new chancellor has bought the government some breathing space.
""But markets are fickle and two weeks is a long time in economics, as in politics. It's a pretty easy and obvious step to reverse most of those unfunded tax cuts announced in the mini-budget but it's less straightforward to move the debate along. And that's where the real risk lies. Austerity might not be palatable, but it seems to be on the table."" 
ft in the government's economic policies and market turmoil in recent weeks had led to Goldman Sachs downgrading its forecasts for UK economic growth.
On Sunday, the investment bank revised its 2023 UK economic output forecast from a 0.4% drop to a 1% drop.
Goldman said it expected a ""more significant recession in the UK"", in part due to ""significantly tighter financial conditions"" and the planned higher corporation tax rate from next April."	/news/business-63278821
business	Periods: Company offers staff time off and flexible working	"When Megan Thompson feels unwell while on her period, she can take time off.
23-year-old can adjust her hours or work flexibly to help cope with severe cramps, migraines and fatigue.
But if her period pain gets too bad, the finance company she works for allows her to take additional leave.
""It's so refreshing being able to say to my manager 'I'm on my period' and she knows instantly to offer support,"" said Megan.
""And they actually offer me time off instead of me having to ask for it.""
Megan said it is refreshing being able to say to her manager she is on her period and they offer support
Megan, from Cardiff, has worked for Hargreaves Lansdown in Bristol for about two years and the company have had a specific period policy since last year.
""Sometimes I still feel guilty about working flexibly around my period because I know some people don't suffer as badly with it,"" she said.
""But at the same time it does happen every month and I can't help that so I'm learning to put my guilt aside and do what works for me whether that's taking time off or working from home or sometimes feeling fine and then I don't need that support.
""When I started working here I was shocked that they had a policy but now I just don't understand why more companies don't have it.""
Employers with similar policies have said they want to get rid of the stigma around talking about periods.
Megan said previous employers were sometimes dismissive of how unwell she can feel.
She commutes almost an hour to the office in Bristol and thinks Hargreaves Lansdown's policy has ""really helped her"". 
She said she thought it also benefitted the company, as being unwell meant she could ""make mistakes and it could cost clients"".
""Society 100% needs to normalise periods,"" Megan added.
firm said it updated its menopause policy in an effort to be more inclusive and help increase productivity.
ge girls have been turning to the internet to learn about periods
""It's symptoms 50% of the population experience so when you're trying to make the culture as inclusive as possible it makes sense to think how do you support that structurally,"" said Anna Langdon of Hargreaves Lansdown.
""Whilst it might not be relevant for one colleague it might be for another so putting a policy in place really helps that colleague who does need it.""
Few countries have formal medical leave for periods but Spain could introduce it for those who suffer from severe pain.
In the UK, policies vary from informal to formal, with the Covid pandemic allowing many to work from home with more flexibility.
Other counties that offer flexible working for periods include Japan, Indonesia, South Korea and Zambia.
However, all their laws vary widely, with the majority of countries not offering paid leave but providing extra time off outside statutory sick leave.
Courtney Wilbor has also felt really unwell while on her period, but she did not take any time off, because of the stigma.
""I have been to the doctors numerous times about my periods due to severe pain from cramps and on a couple of occasions I've passed out,""  said the 21-year-old letting agent.
""I have never taken leave due to periods as I feel as though it isn't a valid excuse to have time off work as it makes me feel as though my employer would expect me to then take the time off every month.""
Courtney, from Cardiff, said companies should offer flexible working for periods as women feel ashamed to show they are struggling and feel unable to take time off.
She said she hoped companies would ""encourage policies for people with periods to have flexible working options and mitigate the difficulties it poses for female employees"".
But she added it could ""create friction"" in the workplace due to unfair bias from people who do not have that flexibility or due to fears the policy will be abused. 
She added similar policies could make workplaces ""more attractive"" and could encourage more progression at work for women in particular.

sports	Putney: Rowers say new pier could end racing on stretch of river	"Rowers have hit out against a proposed pier in south-west London, saying it could be the ""end of racing"" on that section of the River Thames.
roposed pier next to Putney Bridge would interfere with the river's tideway, according to rowers including Olympian Guy Pooley.
fear safety and the Oxford-Cambridge boat race could be impacted.
Uber Boats by Thames Clippers want to build the pier to expand its services and to ""improve accessibility"". 
Boat company Livett's Launches has also applied to build a 74-metre (250 ft) extension to the existing Putney Pier and upgrade it.
Currently, Uber Boats serve 24 piers from Barking Riverside to Putney Pier.
RB6 route, which stops at Putney and Wandsworth piers, only operates during the morning and evening on weekdays. 
A petition to extend the serviceÂ to weekends has gained more than 1,485 signatures. according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).
But rowers have written to Wandsworth Council to express concerns the pier would impact racing, in particular the Boat Race and Head of the River races.
Olympic rower Guy Pooley, head of rowing at Eton College, wrote: ""The position of this new pier and the consequent activity around it will adversely affect the ability of the local rowing clubs to operate safely in that area.""
Paralympic rower and two-time World Champion Erin Kennedy MBE said it would impact ""all social rowing on the Tideway"" while Alastair Marks, chief executive of British Rowing, said it would increase the risk of accidents.
""The impact of this proposal would therefore be that crews would simply no longer be able to use this stretch of water,"" he said.
""Given that rowing boats are fragile and difficult to manoeuvre, the risks of doing so would be too great because accidents would be inevitable.""
Uber Boat by Thames Clippers said all historic races would be able to go ahead under the plans and there would be no services running during the events. 
It added a risk assessment showed the new pier ""posed no greater risk"", saying access for clubs would not be restricted.Â 
A spokesperson added: ""A new pierÂ would allow us to futureÂ proof theÂ PutneyÂ riverÂ bus routeÂ andÂ toÂ explore a more frequent off-peak and weekend service inÂ Putney.
""This willÂ helpÂ more Londoners enjoy fast, convenient commutes and day trip journeys by river."""	/news/uk-england-london-62751927

health	Eileen Dean care home killing: No risk assessment done on attacker	"No formal risk assessment was done on a man who beat a fellow care home resident to death, a review has found.
Alexander Rawson attacked 93-year-old Eileen Dean with a metal walking stick at a care home in south-east London.
Mrs Dean suffered catastrophic injuries to her head and body and died later in hospital.
A review found Fieldside Care Home in Catford did not provide the specialist mental health services that Rawson - who had a history of violence - needed. 
Last year, Rawson was given an indefinite hospital order by a judge at the Old Bailey after it was decided he was mentally unfit to stand trial.
Rawson, who had a history of mental health problems caused by alcoholism, was 62 when he was placed in the home a few days before Christmas 2020.
He was put in the room next to Mrs Dean and, in the first week of 2021, he went into her room at night and attacked her.
In a review published on Friday, the Lewisham Safeguarding Adults Board said Rawson had been moved into the home after being an inpatient at a psychiatric unit run by the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. 
re home was the only place that agreed to take him after his discharge from hospital.
report described how Rawson was moved between four hospital wards and a care home in three locations and between two NHS trusts with information not gathered, recorded correctly or passed on.
In the months before he was moved into the care home, Rawson was involved in at least 34 recorded incidents of violence or threats to patients and health staff, including a threat to kill.  
He had threatened to use a bread knife, scissors and dinner trays as weapons, had thrown jugs of water and cups and smashed equipment including computers, a radio and a crash trolley.
Before he was placed in the home, no attempts were made to find out whether Rawson had come into contact with the criminal justice system over his behaviour, the report found.
It states that the care home had asked about the risks Rawson posed before they took him and had been reassured by a social worker and medical staff.
review also found that when the care home agreed to take Rawson, it had not told the watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), that it was housing people under the age of 65 with certain mental health needs.
A CQC spokesperson said: ""The circumstances of Eileen Dean's death are appalling and our thoughts are with everyone affected.
""Health and social care providers must ensure they adequately assess the needs of people receiving their services, and collaborate to ensure appropriate placements are made. 
""This includes sharing all relevant information when a transfer is being considered, so a person's new service can assess whether it can meet their needs while ensuring the safety of other people using the service.""
king to the BBC, Mrs Dean's daughter Georgina Hampshaw said: ""I'm just mortified that all our fears of what happened were proved. Multiple agencies failed to do risk assessments, failed to call the police at the hospital, which minimalised all his aggressiveness and violence.
""There were just catastrophic failings by not just one, but all the trusts. Alex Rawson was not diagnosed properly. He had a condition they didn't understand and had complex mental health issues, which nobody seemed to touch upon.
""I'm angry that I handed over a precious person that I cared for for 20 years and they let me down.""
In an earlier statement she said: ""The decision to place this person at the care home where my mother resided could not have been more flawed and resulted directly in the horrific murder of my gentle mother.
""No other family should have to suffer the loss of a loved one in such tragic circumstances.""
Nathalie Zacharias, director of therapies at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""We welcome the report's findings and recommendations and have conducted our own full investigation which identified where we can make improvements to the care we provide. 
""This includes putting robust checks in place to ensure all known risks, including those which take place off our premises, are fully recorded and documented and ensuring people in our communities continue to receive the care and treatment most suitable for their needs."""	/news/uk-england-london-63598953
business	Weak pound puts the squeeze on holiday spending	"und's weakness against the dollar and the euro spells bad news for British holidaymakers this summer.
Fears over the UK economy are weighing on markets, causing sterling to sink below $1.20 on Tuesday, its lowest level since the start of the pandemic, before partly recovering on Wednesday. 
Versus the euro, the pound is hovering near thirteen-month lows.
As a result many Brits travelling in the next few weeks will find their spending money won't stretch as far.
""The pound remains a very vulnerable currency,"" said Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at the Dutch bank Rabobank.
""A lot of this is related to fears about growth,"" she continued, noting that political uncertainty and a potential trade conflict with the European Union were likely to add to investors' concerns about the UK's economic outlook.
weakness of the pound will ""add to the gloom"" for British holidaymakers, who are already facing the prospect of travel disruption, said Ms Foley.
After more than two years of Covid restrictions, many people are planning their first trips overseas, with the peak summer holiday season and the long school break hovering on the horizon.
But when they get there, they could find the pound in their pocket doesn't go as far, Ms Foley warned.
""If you're going to the Eurozone or the United States, you're going to be able to purchase less,"" she said.
""When we look at the dollar, it's very strong, so holidaymakers going to the US are really going to see the weakness.""
Some holidaymakers will already have adjusted for this, however.
""Sterling's been on the backfoot for several years, so to some extent this weakness is already expected,"" Ms Foley said.
Fears have grown over the prospects for the UK economy after figures showed it shrank again in April for the second month in a row, with businesses feeling the impact of rising prices. 
re is uncertainty over how fast the Bank of England - which is expected to raise interest rates again on Thursday - can tighten policy this year to tame inflation without further hurting the economy further.
However the pound's weakness is also a result of a strong dollar, Ms Foley said, with rising interest rates there making the US currency more attractive.
""A more aggressive pace of US interest rate hikes is certainly propping up the dollar,"" she said. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is expected to raise rates substantially after its policy meeting on Wednesday, to try to curb rising inflation there.
""Also, the dollar does have this safe haven appeal, so when we're looking at concerns perhaps about China, perhaps about the gas crisis in Europe, a large part of this does create an environment where people want to hold dollars.""

entertainment	2022 viral videos: Six social media moments that charmed Indians	"Sometimes, it takes time and effort to go viral on social media.
And other times, you just go viral for yelling at the wrong man on live TV.
r's top social media moments in India were an entertaining mix of the two.
One of the first big viral moments of the year was a comedy of errors that played out live on an Indian news channel.
News anchor Rahul Shivshankar, who was hosting a panel discussion on the TV channel Times Now, berated a Ukrainian journalist for almost two minutes, thinking he was addressing Daniel McAdams, a US foreign policy commentator.
r only realised his mistake when a frustrated Mr McAdams - the other guest - yelled back. ""I AM Mr McAdams! I am Mr McAdams and I haven't said a word, so stop yelling at me!""
xchange made ""McAdams"" a top Twitter trend in India as viewers used to seeing high-decibel news debates on the channel sympathised with his plight.
Bollywood star Ranveer Singh's nude photoshoot for Paper Magazine in July led to a flurry of memes and jokes online. 
Most jokes referenced the actor's flamboyant sense of style and exuberant persona and took aim at his slightly awkward poses from the shoot - one meme, for instance, superimposed Singh on Michaelangelo's painting, The Creation of Adam.
Others exercised their creativity by covering him up.
But the photos also spurred outrage and indignation. 
Norwegian crew Quick Style went viral for performing a hit song from the 2016 Bollywood film Baar Baar Dekho at a wedding in June.
Dressed in suits for their friend's wedding, the men sported sunglasses as they performed to Kala Chashma among other Bollywood hits.
ral video soon had people across the world dancing, and it became a trend on Instagram and Tiktok. A video of the full performance has over 95 million views on YouTube.
r Instagram Reel also got the attention of Bollywood star Katrina Kaif, who featured in the original song - she left a fire emoji in the comments section. 
zanian siblings Kili and Neema Paul's videos of themselves lip syncing perfectly to a host of songs in Indian languages have earned them a huge fanbase in India.
gs take turns singing and dance to some of the most popular songs in Hindi, Punjabi and Tamil and post the videos on TikTok (which is banned in India) and Instagram.
Kili and Neema taught themselves to sing in Hindi after watching Bollywood films in the local cinemas in Tanzania.
""I fell in love with the movies and the songs. When you love something it becomes easy to learn,"" Kili told the BBC last year.
One of their most popular videos, a performance of the song Arabic Kuthu from the Tamil-language film Beast, has more than 80 million views on Instagram.
Kili visited India in October and appeared on Indian reality TV and dance shows.
One of the songs Kili and Neema Paul have danced to recently? Lata Mangeshkar's song Mera Dil Yeh Pukare Aaja, which swept through social media in November after a Pakistani woman danced to it at a wedding. 
Ayesha, dressed in a green outfit, danced to a remixed version of the 1954 Bollywood song and soon had Indians and Pakistanis grooving.
Her video has been viewed more than 19 million times since it was posted on 11 November. It also introduced the song to a new set of fans and generated more than two million Instagram reels - even Bollywood star Madhuri Dixit couldn't resist it.
A street vendor's jingle while trying to sell peanuts in West Bengal state went viral in the first few months of 2022 after it was captured on video. Bhuban Badyakar's song Kacha Badam - meaning raw peanuts - was on everyone's lips as it became a hit on YouTube and Instagram.
Badyakar later collaborated with musicians Nazmu Reachat and Amit Dhull to do videos and songs based on his jingle."	/news/world-asia-india-64062203
business	Liz Truss versus The Markets	"What drives ""The Markets"" to act as they do, and to blow governments off course? Do investors want political power, to undercut public spending, or merely a reliable return for their money?
Can a democracy be undermined by ""The Markets""? The left has long thought so. The experience of Greece, during the Eurozone crisis, showed how it can happen - a democratic mandate blown off course because the markets don't think the government can sustain its borrowing.
's not what was expected of a Conservative government in one of the world's largest economies with its own currency.
It may seem stranger still when that government sets out to cut top rate tax and let companies keep more of their profits, while removing restrictions on financiers' bonuses. How could ""The Markets"" wish to undermine that?
But that's what we've seen. From the left comes one observation that governments should protect us from markets, but with the humiliating dismantling of Liz Truss's experiment in unfunded tax-cutting, it has been markets that have protected us from the government.
So how can an entity which is impossible to locate, with no central neural function, and with a reputation for being skittish, herd-like, irrational and ethically challenged, force Downing Street to abandon its plans?
It has to do with risk and trust. Like an old-fashioned bank manager assessing you for a loan, those who take the individual decisions to buy a UK government bond have to make a judgement on whether the government that issued it is able to pay out interest each year and to repay the face value at the end of its term? 
And by that time, might there be so many other bonds issued that it's significantly less likely that it can do so?
It is not just a question of whether Britain would default, which it has never done before. It is an investor's judgement of whether that bond will hold its value as debt grows.
So what are these investors looking for? A serious, stable government that knows what it's doing, that sets rules for controlling its annual deficits and debt, with a reasonable expectation that it has the discipline to stick to the plan. The mini-budget on 23 September offered none of that.
Investors can see that governments change course and break rules as they're buffeted by events. They'll often forgive that. They know other parties will win power and bring other priorities. Investors are not anti-democratic. 
But their job is to safeguard money and earn from it, so they also make a judgement about how much that borrowing profile is likely to change with a new government. If one is turfed out by the voters, will the next one act responsibly?
's why ""The Market"" is not just about numbers. The people in it are constantly making judgements about politics and about the people at the top of politics: about stability, reliability and competence, none of which can easily be measured or subjected to the mathematicians whom investment houses hire.
r judgement of character can be as flawed as they are by any of us. But their assessment of Liz Truss and Trussonomics has been harsh.
Bond investors primary concern is with levels of borrowing, but do they care much about the balance of tax and spending? Do they, perhaps, harbour a preference for low tax with a limited state and public services?
You might well find that financiers are more likely to be both conservative about public finance and Conservative with their votes. But it's not necessarily the case that they want to see public services and the size of the state cut back.
For those who invest in company shares rather than bonds, there is a recognition that firms do well in a country with strong public services. They need the infrastructure to get their supplies in and their products to market, their data flowing rapidly and reliably, and to move their staff to and from work. 
For a company that operates in Britain and the USA, their workforce is provided with relatively efficient, tax-funded health care in one country, while the payroll cost of private insurance in the other is a huge corporate  burden. Corporate investors are attracted to countries with a strong and reasonably predictable rule of law.
want to see an economy that's geared for growth, and Liz Truss is not the only person who thinks that the UK needs to boost its growth rate. Where she differs from many others is in the belief that the starting point is lower tax. 
rs are more likely to identify low productivity as the vital and malfunctioning cog in the British economic machine. They argue that it is in adding value during an hour's or a day's honest toil that we earn greater prosperity, rather than stimulating demand and investment, while whizzing money round the economy at a faster rate.
So with a background of rising interest rates internationally, and after three weeks of political and financial turmoil buffeting the British government, what did the markets perceive as Liz Truss junked her close ally as punishment for implementing the policies that won her the Tory leadership?
Enough to give her the thumbs down. Thursday's expectations of a U-turn rallied bond prices and the pound. But these positive moves were pared back when they saw, first, the limited extent of the announcement and - perhaps more important - the limited understanding that the prime minister seems to have of her weak position as she faced the cameras on Friday afternoon.
Asked why she wasn't exiting Downing Street as she had told Kwasi Kwarteng to do, her answers sounded like her continued presence in office is necessary to provide stability.
It's unlikely Jeremy Hunt, the new chancellor, will see things that way. If his job is to reassure markets, and it is, then he can dictate terms to his neighbour in Number 10. 
In interviews on Saturday morning, he did little to support the prime minister beyond repeating her appeal for stability. At the same time, he did a lot to shred her approach to public finances. 
More taxes will have to rise, he said. Spending will be cut. Nothing is protected while he examines the books, including spending on the NHS. This was not just a U-turn on a botched mini-budget, but a re-set of Britain's public finances, with a warning that it will hurt.
Liz Truss looks like a prisoner of her new chancellor. With her authority in tatters, she is a prisoner of her cabinet, if they combine to stand up to her. She is a prisoner of her parliamentary party, in which MPs are reported to be deeply dismayed and unimpressed.
PM can continue to push the larger part of the mini-budget's Growth Plan that remains, for now, intact. 
But apart from tax, look what that involves: planning deregulation to allow housebuilding, fracking (also not in Scotland), de-regulation of worker rights and environmental protection - all of them vulnerable to backbench mutiny as well as external pushback. Does Liz Truss really have the authority to push these through against opposition?
And then there's spending. In her brief statement, she gave a few hints of where she's heading. One was: ""We will do whatever is necessary to ensure debt is falling as a share of the economy in the medium term"".
Whatever is necessary means either tax or spending or both have to fit with that borrowing constraint, and the prime minister will surely want to hang on to at least some of her tax cuts. 
Second, she talked of delivering public services more efficiently. Who could argue with that? But it's been tried by every other prime minister, and if it doesn't mean cuts, then it certainly means a squeeze, and usually an uncomfortable one for those who depend on those services as well as public sector workers. The new chancellor, from his time as health secretary, has shown he is content to court unpopularity.
""Spending will grow less rapidly than previously planned"": another hint from the prime minister of at least a squeeze, and amplified on Saturday by Jeremy Hunt.
uld come to Scots directly in welfare benefits and indirectly through the block grant to Holyrood, with limited ability for MSPs to use tax varying and welfare powers to mitigate the effects.
Scottish government and SNP MSPs may also be watching closely and learning what happens to a country that lives beyond its means in the vague hope that the bond markets will sustain an uncontrolled level of deficit and rising debt at comparable interest rates to its neighbours, and in the equally vague hope that this will achieve faster growth with which to make anything and everything possible.
It may have a sobering effect this Monday as the Scottish government publishes its economic prospectus for independence."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63268826

business	Eight million Australians urged to turn off lights	"Australia's energy minister has urged households in New South Wales - a state that includes the country's biggest city Sydney - to switch off their lights in the face of an energy crisis.
Chris Bowen says people should not use electricity for two hours every evening if they ""have a choice"".
However, he added he was ""confident"" that blackouts could be avoided.
It comes after Australia's main wholesale electricity market was suspended because of a surge in prices.
Mr Bowen asked people living in New South Wales to conserve as much power as possible.
""If you have a choice about when to run certain items, don't run them from 6 to 8 [in the evening],"" he said during a televised media conference in Canberra.
Australia is one of the world's biggest exporters of coal and liquefied natural gas but has been struggling with a power crisis since last month. Three quarters of the country's electricity is still generated using coal. It has long been accused of not doing enough to cut its emissions by investing in renewables. 
In recent weeks, Australia has felt the impact of disruptions to coal supplies, outages at several coal-fired power plants and soaring global energy prices. 
Flooding earlier this year hit some coal mines in New South Wales and Queensland, while technical issues have cut production at two mines that supply the market's biggest coal-fired station in New South Wales.
Around a quarter of Australia's coal-fired electricity generating capacity is currently out of service due to unexpected outages and scheduled maintenance.
Some electricity producers have seen their costs soar as global coal and gas prices have jumped due to sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, demand for energy has jumped amid a cold snap and as Australia's economy opens up after Covid-19 restrictions were eased.
All of this has helped drive up power prices on the wholesale market to above the A$300 (Â£173; $210) per megawatt hour price cap set by the market's regulator, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo).
However, that cap was below the cost of production for several generators, who decided to withhold capacity.
On Wednesday, Aemo took the unprecedented step of suspending the market and said it would set prices directly and compensate generators for the shortfall.
It also asked consumers in New South Wales to ""temporarily reduce their energy usage"".
Aemo has not given a timeline on when the suspension would be lifted. It said in a statement, ""The price cap will remain until cumulative wholesale electricity prices fall below the cumulative price threshold.""
""Aemo, as the national power system operator, will continue to monitor the situation and provide further updates should conditions change,"" it added.
On Thursday, Australia's biggest electricity producer AGL Energy said it expected to be able to supply more power to businesses and consumers in the coming days.
It has three units that have been out of service at its coal-fired plant in Bayswater, New South Wales.
re among several planned and unplanned outages that have helped cause the power crisis.
AGL said that one of the units should return to service on Thursday, while another will come back online by Saturday.
Meanwhile, Australia's new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the crisis would be raised at a meeting with state premiers which starts on Thursday.
Lynne Chester, an energy expert from the University of Sydney, told the BBC that policymakers have been aware of the risks of ageing generators for decades.
""The sector's regulators and policy makers have ignored the escalating capacity constraints of aging generation assets, fired by fossil fuels, that dominate the sector,"" Prof Chester said.

politics	Cuban Missile Crisis: The Welshman who prevented nuclear war	"When the world was on the brink of nuclear destruction, one Welshman held his nerve and arguably saved the world.
In October 1962, Soviet Russia tried to install weapons on an island in the Caribbean, an event that became known as the Cuban Missile Crisis.
weapons could have destroyed the United States and so President John F Kennedy blockaded the country.
Welshman Sir David Ormsby-Gore, the then-British ambassador to Washington, managed to keep the president calm.
As America surged ahead in the nuclear arms race, the Soviets felt as though their only option for a pre-emptive strike on the West was to base intermediate missiles on Cuba, just 80 miles off the US coast.
On 22 October President Kennedy was summoned back to the White House and his first orders were: ""Get Ormsby-Gore there without anyone seeing him.""
By the time Air Force One touched down, Sir David - who would later become the fifth Lord Harlech - was waiting in the Oval Office.
Mr Kennedy's Vice-President Lyndon B Johnson wrote: ""I was there, with the door hitting my chair at the bottom end of the table, and there were those two, poring over maps and whispering to each other at the other end.
""Why was this Welshman even in the room?""
wer went back to 1938, when JFK's father, Joseph Kennedy, had been US ambassador to London.
Gary Ginsberg, lawyer to the Clintons, journalist, historian and author of First Friends, an account of the people who have most influenced US presidents, said it was a partnership long in the forging.
""In the '30s both were second sons, neither had an expectation of greatness on them, but they'd both lose their elder brothers to war and a road accident,"" said Mr Ginsberg.
""However, at the time all they had to do was to find a friendship based on conversation, golf, horses and politics.""
Jackie Kennedy became very close with Sir David after Kennedy's assassination
Mr Ginsberg describes how the pair would both sit in the public gallery of the House of Commons in order to hear Winston Churchill speak.
""They stayed in touch throughout, as Kennedy became a congressman and Ormsby-Gore an MP.
""I suppose it was a no-brainer when [Harold] Macmillan asked him to take the Chiltern Hundreds [resign as an MP], and become the UK ambassador to Washington.""
On 23 October they sat up all night, with Sir David studiously avoiding calls from then-Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. 
Kennedy had set up a shipping embargo around the island, yet the Soviet boats, carrying ever more missiles, steamed towards Cuba. 
Mr Ginsberg said it was Sir David who then made a suggestion which many at the time saw as weak, but which in hindsight was one of the world's great pieces of diplomacy.
""'Why don't you shrink the embargo from 800 miles to 500?'""
He argued this would give the ships' captains, and the Soviet leaders, greater time to think of the consequences of what they were doing.
It worked. On 29 October the Soviet ships turned for home.
Under Sir David's guidance, the two super powers went on to establish the ""hot line"", a direct communication to ensure tensions could never again reach that level without the two leaders speaking.
US also withdrew missiles from Turkey and an arms reduction treaty was forged.
Just a year later, Mr Kennedy was assassinated.
Now Lord Harlech, Sir David would go on to have a profound influence on the Welsh media scene as chairman of the British Board of Film Classification and Founder of HTV.
In 1968 he proposed to JFK's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, and although she turned him down, the two remained good enough friends that she would attend his funeral in 1985.
Also among the mourners was JFK's brother, Teddy Kennedy, who said his mother Rose had described Sir David as ""another son to me."""	/news/uk-wales-63431334

County Armagh pharmacist Mark Hunter said when a drug became available and his pharmacy had a prescription it would order it and dispense it regardless of how much it cost.
""What we will pay for it is anybody's guess,"" he said.
""We hope that the government will pay us enough to cover the costs of the drugs, but in our experience they never do - we will lose money.""
Pharmacies buy drugs from suppliers at net prices. 
re is an annual Department of Health budget to reimburse the pharmacies for that outlay, but for a number of years now pharmacists have said that budget is not enough and they are dispensing at a loss.
""That inhaler - they'll pay me Â£44.50 less 10%, so I'll get paid Â£40 for something I cannot get for less than Â£44.50,"" Mr Hunter said.

""We're losing money hand over fist on so many drugs. We have so much uncertainty that our business model doesn't work.
""We're hoping at the end of the month to have enough money to pay for our drugs and to pay our staff. It's as bleak as that.""
Chief Pharmaceutical Officer Cathy Harrison has dismissed any suggestion community pharmacies may be forced to close.
Speaking to the BBC's Talkback programme, Ms Harrison said pharmacies would be reimbursed for medicines they had supplied. 
She said she was working closely with community pharmacy representatives.
Community Pharmacy NI said there are on average one million dispensings every week in Northern Ireland, many in some of the most rural and remote areas.
Chief executive Gerard Greene said the issue with loss-making prescriptions had become acute over the past eight months.
""We're worried about the ability of the sector to continue meeting its obligations to wholesalers and also to provide the services that the public have come to depend on during the pandemic and since,"" he said.
Community Pharmacy NI is calling on the department to revise the amount of money it gives to pharmacies.
""It's important at a time when the health service is really struggling that we resource the parts of the system that are working,"" Mr Greene added.
""We're pleading with the department to recognise how frail the sector is and to invest accordingly. 
""Without it there will be even worse problems that the health service will have to face going forward.""
In November, the Department of Health announced an emergency review of community pharmacy services, which it said aims to define the services that can be reliably delivered this winter.
In 2022, the department developed a financial package worth more than Â£5m, which is currently being implemented.
In a statement, the department said it was very conscious of the challenges facing community pharmacies. 
It continued: ""The permanent secretary, Peter May, along with officials from the department, met representatives of Community Pharmacy NI in November to discuss the current challenges facing the sector and the urgent work ongoing to address a number of issues. 
""The emergency review is nearing completion and the Permanent Secretary will shortly be meeting again with Community Pharmacy NI representatives to discuss the findings and next steps."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63970047
entertainment	Taylor Swift breaks Arctic Monkeys chart-topping streak	"r Swift has denied Arctic Monkeys their seventh straight chart-topping album, after her own new LP raced to number one on Friday.
Her 10th album, Midnights, became the fastest-selling record of 2022, with 204,000 equivalent sales in week one.
Sheffield rock band finished in second place with more than 100,000 chart sales in seven days for The Car.
would have been enough sales to reach number one in a normal week where there was no competition from Swift.
US singer more than doubled her previous best opening week album sales, which she achieved in 2014 for her album 1989.
Anti-Hero, the breakout hit from the 32-year-old's latest album, also topped this week's singles chart.
Suitably named Swift has now surpassed Harry Styles' third album Harry's House to record the UK's fastest-selling record of 2022 so far.
Perhaps even more notably, Swift has overtaken Madonna by setting a new chart record for the quickest succession of nine UK number one albums by a female artist.
She managed it in 10 years flat, while it took the Madonna 21 years to achieve the same feat. However, the Queen of Pop is still ahead of Swift on the overall league table for most number one albums.
Midnights is Swift's first original studio album in two years, and sees her return to a more mainstream sound following the acoustic tone of her previous two albums.
It was devoured by fans, breaking the record for the most-streamed album on Spotify in one day.
um was also met with rave reviews from critics, although some said its subdued tone meant it lacked potential hit singles.
w record retains some of the folksy charm of sister albums Folklore and Evermore, both released in 2020 during the pandemic. But it also sees her re-engage her pop sensibilities, with lyrics that explore more personal subject matters.
Some songs offer fans further insight into the star's normally low-key relationship with her boyfriend, English actor Joe Alwyn.
ght bump in the road during a glorious run this week came when her team re-edited a music video days after its release, following a backlash over one of the scenes.
In the original video for Anti-Hero - which this week knocked Sam Smith off top spot - the singer steps onto a scale that reads ""FAT"", as her alter ego shakes her head, seemingly in disappointment.
Recent Reading and Leeds headliners Arctic Monkeys will be disappointed not to have added to their collection of six number one albums, with the follow-up to their divisive Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, which marked a move towards a more expansive, cinematic sound.
Also released last Friday, The Car is tighter and more immediate than its predecessor but it spins in the same sonic universe, with beautifully crafted orchestral, soulful and at-times funky tracks like There'd Better Be a Mirror Ball and Body Paint.
""I made a big deal about the piano on the last record,"" singer Alex Turner recently told BBC music correspondent Mark Savage. ""But when I look at it now, the shift in sound between that record and the one before [AM] is more to do with the fact that my writing process [changed] around that time"".
""So the piano had a part in it, but being able to record myself and write to those recordings is perhaps what got us into this mess,"" he added.
Remarkably, all of this week's top five albums are new entries, meaning that, despite it being a particularly crowded field, there were still strong showings from Loyle Carner, Simple Minds and Kylie Minogue."	/news/entertainment-arts-63423816

business	Firms frustrated by post-Brexit trade red tape	"Firms are ""banging their heads against the wall"" two years after post-Brexit trading began, a new report suggests.
British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said businesses were still grappling with EU trading arrangements and more red tape.
It comes as a separate report from the Centre for European Reform suggests Brexit may have reduced UK trade by around 7%.
But the government said Brexit ""opens new opportunities for UK businesses"".
rade and Cooperation Agreement, which was struck late on Christmas Eve 2020, meant goods and services could still flow between the UK and EU without tariffs after Brexit. 
British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) questioned 1,168 businesses and 514 said they traded overseas or were otherwise affected by the agreement.
More than half of these firms said they were struggling with the new rules which mean they have to deal with new forms, checks or other processes.
One retailer in Ayrshire said leaving the EU ""made us uncompetitive with our EU customers"". The retailer had to build a base in the EU or it would have lost its EU trade.
""This has cost our business a huge amount of money which could have been invested in the UK had it not been for Brexit,"" the retailer said.
A manufacturer in Dorset, meanwhile, said that even importing parts to fix machines has been a ""nightmare"".
""Brexit has been the biggest ever imposition of bureaucracy on business,"" it said.
As businesses face the prospect of a likely recession, the BCC is urging the government to have ""an honest dialogue about how we can improve our trading relationship with the EU"" and look to reduce red tape even before the deal is reviewed in 2026. 
It has made 24 recommendations - including reaching a swift agreement on the future of the Northern Ireland Protocol, the rules governing trading in Ireland.
Political uncertainty surrounding that has, some economists have said, deterred investment in the UK.
Meanwhile, the Centre for European Reform said that changes related to Brexit may have reduced UK trade by as much as 7% this summer - and damaged investment by even more: meaning that UK economic output is 5.5% smaller than it would otherwise have been.
gger impact than assumed by the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which has said there will be a 4% hit to productivity.
However, in March the OBR predicted that imports and exports would be 15% lower in the long run, and that new trade deals with the rest of the world would not make much difference to trade volumes.
Businesses that trade across the UK's borders have faced a triple whammy in the last few years: pandemic-related lockdowns around the world, a cost of living crisis heightened by the fallout from the war in Ukraine, and a change in trading arrangements with our biggest partner, the EU. Disentangling the impact of Brexit has been tricky. 
But the report from the BCC underlines that the extra formalities, including paperwork and checks, are posing costly problems for some companies.
An earlier study from researchers at the London School of Economics found that the range of goods of exports being sent to the EU has shrunk, suggesting perhaps that the extra red tape may have deterred some smaller companies from exporting altogether.
It also claimed that cost of food from the EU has risen faster than that from elsewhere, bumping up grocery bills. 
Economists disagree about the economic effects of Brexit.
But most would agree that the UK has failed to realise overall economic gains from leaving the EU - not yet, anyway.
John Springfield, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform, said that in the second quarter of 2022, Brexit meant the economy was Â£33bn smaller than it would have been had the UK voted to remain.
He added that Brexit's effect in stifling the economy meant the government had to raise taxes to find an extra Â£40bn to fund public services.
Other economists dispute these numbers, saying that the pandemic and the cost of living crisis, heightened by the fallout from the war in Ukraine, has made assessing the impact of Brexit problematic.
David Henig, a trade expert and director of the UK trade policy project at the European Centre for International Political Economy, said it is small traders who will be the hardest hit.
""What has happened is that it used to be pretty seamless to trade with the EU and it's now more like trading with anywhere else in the rest of the world. But that's not easy, particularly for those that trade particular goods and sensitive goods, especially things like chemicals, food and drink,"" he said.
""Smaller traders who perhaps aren't that experienced outside the EU are finding it a bit of a shock now, what they have to do to trade with the EU. And that is having an impact.""
government said that the Brexit trading deal was ""the world's largest zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal"".
""Despite difficult global economic headwinds, UK-EU trade is rebounding, with recent data showing that UK trade to both EU and non-EU countries is above pre-Covid levels,"" a spokesperson said, adding exporters had been provided with ""practical support"" with post-Brexit trading arrangements.
""We've also removed 400 trade barriers across 70 countries in the past two years, removed tariffs on Â£30bn worth of goods and cut Â£1bn business costs arising from current retained EU law,"" the spokesperson added.
However, the food, farming and fisheries minister Mark Spencer admitted there was ""more we can do"" to cut UK-EU red tape.
""Of course, there's always more that we can do to try and ease the way for the passage of trade. We're very keen to do that,"" Mr Spencer told Times Radio.
""We're a free and open trading nation. We want to work closely with our EU colleagues, we want to try and reduce that red tape if there is any red tape on their side of the Channel, so of course we want to keep those channels of trade open in both directions."""	/news/business-64052849
business	Cost of living crisis prompts 'big state' response	"Earlier this month I used the analogy that in dealing with stagflation - a period of simultaneous stagnant growth and high inflation - the Treasury and the Bank of England are having to ride a tandem across a tightrope. 
Both institutions have individual balancing acts that are very difficult, but they also need to coordinate their responses carefully.
As it happens the classic textbook response to stagflation is for the central bank to raise rates to deal with accelerating prices, and the government to support the economy in some way. The UK is now far closer to that. 
Indeed some economists suggest the Bank of England might now have to raise rates faster, as a result of the new government rescue package.
Reasonable questions are now being asked about just how one-off these payments will prove.
Earlier this month I asked the chancellor what the conceptual difference was between the pandemic intervention offering ""whatever it takes"" and the position on the energy crisis of doing ""whatever we can"". 
ravelling across the country, I have never seen such universal pressure on households and businesses. I have never seen such willingness to tell our cameras the extent of the squeeze. And I have never seen such a level of expectation that the government should step in, in a massive way.
As I said yesterday, the furlough scheme during the pandemic has raised the bar for what the public expect of the government during a crisis.
For a government full of pamphleteers and theorists who write about lower taxes, freer markets and a smaller state, the inescapable reality of this crisis-ridden decade is a British state that has been left permanently bigger. 
It is not just that intellectual and philosophical instincts are being trumped in a crisis. The prime minister's Brexit voter coalition in 2016 and 2019 were promised a state that did more.
won't be the last time that the government will intervene fiscally, in a manner it would not have dreamt of before the pandemic. 
And the message from the World Economic Forum in Davos this week was that the crisis era is far from over."	/news/business-61610296
business	Ryanair boss O'Leary says the era of â¬10 flights is over	"Ryanair won't be offering flights at rock bottom prices any more thanks to the soaring cost of fuel, the budget airline's boss has admitted.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary says the era of the â¬10 ticket is over.
rline's average fare would rise from around â¬40 (Â£33.75) last year to roughly â¬50 over the next five years, he told the BBC.
But he says he believes people will continue to fly frequently, despite the rising cost of living.
""There's no doubt that at the lower end of the marketplace, our really cheap promotional fares - the one euro fares, the â¬0.99 fares, even the â¬9.99 fares - I think you will not see those fares for the next number of years,"" Mr O'Leary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 
rise in fuel costs that is pushing up air fares, is also raising household energy bills, eating into people's disposable incomes. But the airline boss said, despite that, he expects customers to seek out lower-cost options rather than cut back on flights.
""We think people will continue to fly frequently. But I think people are going to become much more price sensitive and therefore my view of life is that people will trade down in their many millions.""
As airfares have become cheaper in recent decades, the number of flights taken has risen, with more people taking short breaks abroad, on top of an annual holiday. Airlines like Ryanair, Easyjet, Vueling and Wizz Air have competed to offer low-cost no-frills services.
Commercial flights now account for about 2.4% of global CO2 emissions, and the sector is facing pressure to reduce its impact on the climate, including campaigns to persuade people to switch to rail and road travel.
However, Mr O'Leary argued road transport and shipping were bigger contributors of CO2 overall, and said the focus on reducing emissions from air travel was ""misplaced"".
He said Ryanair was investing in more fuel efficient aircraft, but that greater reductions in fossil fuel use would come from the switch from petrol and diesel to electric road vehicles.
In the wake of the Covid pandemic, which severely disrupted international travel, people have proved eager to get back on board flights.
But as demand for air travel has bounced back, staff shortages at airlines and airports have lead to delays and cancellations, in the UK and abroad. Some passengers have been forced to wait for hours, or reschedule travel at the last minute. 
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had managed the situation better than other airlines because it had been ""part lucky and part brave"" in its decision to start recruiting and training cabin crew and pilots last November when the Omicron variant was still affecting international travel. 
In the first six months of 2022, Ryanair cancelled 0.3% of flights, compared with British Airways' total of 3.5%, and Easyjet's 2.8%, according to air travel consultancy OAG.
Mr O'Leary said he had ""very little sympathy"" for the airports, saying they knew schedules months in advance and that security staff, which are the responsibility of the airports, required less training than pilots.
He accused Heathrow, which has capped the number of passengers coming to the airport over the summer, of ""mismanagement"".
Mr O'Leary said he was ""hopeful"" the problems at UK airports would be resolved by next summer, but said Brexit could continue to create challenges when recruiting staff.
Heathrow has previously defended the cap, saying it was necessary to provide a reliable and safe service. 
Publishing its latest traffic figures on Thursday the airport said the cap was working and that July had seen ""improvements to passenger experience"" - with fewer last minute cancellations and better aircraft punctuality and baggage handling. 
It said 88% of passengers were now clearing security in 20 minutes or less. It added that 1,300 people had been hired at the airport since last November, and that ""security resource is back at pre-pandemic levels"".
Airports Operators Association has said airports in general have been recruiting staff since late last year and most passengers are now travelling with no, or minimal, disruption. 
Ryanair is based in Dublin, but operates hundreds of routes in and out of the UK.
Britain's departure from the EU had proved to be a ""disaster for the free movement of labour"" Mr O'Leary said said and called on the government to ""be honest and own up"" that it was the cause of worker shortages.
UK labour market was ""fundamentally broken"" Mr O'Leary said and argued it was time for the UK to consider reversing ""some of the stupidity of Brexit"". He said the priority for the next UK prime minister should be to sign a free trade deal with the EU, including free movement of labour."	/news/business-62495846
technology	Stolen $3bn Bitcoin mystery ends with popcorn tin discovery	"US Department of Justice has revealed it seized $3.36bn (Â£2.9bn) of Bitcoin last year which was stolen from an infamous darknet website. 
f 50,676 Bitcoin was found hidden on various devices in a hacker's home in an underfloor safe and inside a popcorn tin. 
James Zhong has pleaded guilty to hacking the funds in 2012 from the illegal Silk Road marketplace.
US authorities say the seizure is the second largest in history.
raid at Mr Zhong's Georgia home was carried out a year ago but only revealed now.
It came at the same time as Bitcoin's value peaked - the seized funds would now be worth about $1.1bn.
Officers say they found the Bitcoin dotted around his home on hard drives and other storage devices in an underfloor safe and on a tiny computer hidden inside a popcorn tin in a bathroom closet.
Police say Mr Zhong was able to steal the funds from the Silk Road by exploiting a flaw in the website's payment system.
In September 2012, he set up several accounts on the darknet marketplace and deposited a small amount of Bitcoin into his digital wallets. He then found a way to withdraw far larger amounts rapidly so as not to raise suspicion.
Watch: The BBC's Joe Tidy investigates the darknet drug dealers who keep coming back
Silk Road was the first darknet marketplace, which operated from approximately 2011 until 2013. It was used by drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute massive quantities of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to many buyers.
rknet is a part of the internet that can only be accessed using specialist software.
In 2015 Silk Road's founder Ross Ulbricht was unanimously convicted of running it by a jury and sentenced to life in prison. 
Mr Zhong pleaded guilty on 4 November to hacking the website and has forfeited his Bitcoin and assets to police as he awaits sentencing.
He faces up to 20 years in prison.
Lawyer Damian Williams said that police used cryptocurrency tracing techniques to locate the Bitcoin.
""For almost 10 years, the whereabouts of this massive chunk of missing Bitcoin had ballooned into an over $3.3bn mystery,"" he said.
""This case shows that we won't stop following the money, no matter how expertly hidden, even to a circuit board in the bottom of a popcorn tin.""
At the time this was the largest cryptocurrency seizure in US history, but it was subsequently surpassed in February when more than $4bn in stolen Bitcoin from the 2016 Bitfinex hack was confiscated."	/news/technology-63547765
business	Energy bills: Tens of thousands of firms 'face collapse' without help	"f thousands of businesses are at risk of going under without government support because of soaring energy bills, according to insolvency experts.
Red Flag Alert, which monitors the financial health of firms, told the BBC previously profitable companies are experiencing significant losses.
Among those that survive, many will be forced to make workers redundant, the consultancy said.
Firms are waiting to hear if they will get help with their energy bills.
On Thursday the government, led by new Prime Minister Liz Truss, is expected to announce significant financial support for households facing an 80% rise in the energy price cap in October.
Businesses are not covered by the cap, however, and Red Flag is warning that more than 75,000 larger firms that are high energy users are at risk of insolvency or are likely to lay off staff without government support. 
government's plan is expected to include some relief for businesses - but details are not yet known.
According to Red Flag, many firms will face a choice between paying wages or paying energy bills.
""Businesses can't absorb these costs and they're going to be forced very quickly into a decision about headcount or being able to pay energy bills,"" said chief economist Nicola Headlam. ""That's going to be the reality and it's coming down the track very quickly.""
According to Red Flag Alert, there are 355,000 companies with a turnover higher than Â£1m that are designated as high energy users - industries such as steel, glass, concrete, and paper production. Of those, the company estimates 75,972 are at risk of insolvency, and they estimate 26,720 of them could fail because of energy costs. That is in addition to the 26,000 insolvencies they had already predicted this year.
""That is a colossal number of people whose businesses will fail, without a large-scale support package from the government"", said Ms Headlam. ""That's more than during the pandemic, and more than in any other recession.
""A business turning over a million pounds two years ago would have spent around 8% of that on energy costs and made profits of around Â£90,000.
""If the cost of energy doubles to 16%, that instantly wipes out profitability, and they're straight into a scenario where it threatens the viability of the business within a year.""
Beyond the large, energy-intensive companies, smaller companies with turnover under Â£1m, were also at risk of failure, Red Flag Alert said. It highlighted the hospitality sector where firms face a triple threat of increasing energy bills, higher supply and staffing costs, and a fall-off in consumer spending, squeezed by inflation.
rtainly the case for James Greenhalgh, who runs Flamingos Coffee House in Leeds, and a bar in the city too. The combined energy bill for both is due to leap from Â£1,500 to around Â£10,000 from the beginning of October. 
""That's more expensive than our wage bill. That's just catastrophic,"" said Mr Greenhalgh.
""It's an extinction event for many businesses like mine,"" said Mr Greenhalgh.
""I've been speaking to so many similar businesses in Leeds and everyone's in the same situation - considering whether to try and battle through, mothball sites over the winter and hope things improve, or whether it's game over.""
""The only thing I can do is wait to see what help the government will give. I can't innovate out of it. I can't put prices up because our customers don't have the money.""
Without rapid government help, Mr Greenhalgh said he would have to close one of his sites, and make staff redundant.
""If the government had stepped in two months ago, it would have made a much bigger difference. The delays this summer have slammed customer confidence"", he added.
Red Flag Alert calculates businesses overall will need Â£100bn a year in support to tackle the rise in energy bills. 
While hospitality is not included in that figure, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, restaurateur Martin Williams warned that thousands of smaller firms in the industry were also at risk.
f the Gaucho steakhouse chain urged the government to consider energy bills help, as well as VAT cuts and business rates reform.
""There needs to be some confidence and that can only come from government support by the prime minister and the chancellor,"" he said.
However the government is already under pressure over how it will finance a promised package of support for households, while sticking to promises to cut taxes.
Ms Truss is understood to be planning to borrow up to Â£100bn to to limit the expected sharp rise in energy bills for households and firms. 
Right now, the annual energy bill for a typical household is Â£1,971. From 1 October, however, that is due to rise 80% - to Â£3,549. It is understood that the plans will see a typical household energy bill rise to Â£2,500 instead - about Â£1,000 less than expected, but still about Â£500 more than at present.
As well as households, businesses are also expected to receive some help. Many firms are currently facing even sharper rises than households and many fixed-rate deals for business expire this October, exposing thousands of firms to full costs that could rise by four or five times or more.
In her victory speech, Ms Truss pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis""."	/news/business-62813782

technology	How are 'kamikaze' drones being used by Russia and Ukraine?	"Ukraine has accused Russia of using Iranian drones against civilian targets in Kyiv.
rry explosives which detonate on impact and are launched in waves, making it hard to defend against.
It's believed Russia has been using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in the Ukraine conflict since mid-September.
Also called the Geranium-2 by Russia, it has explosives in a warhead on its nose and is designed to loiter over a target until it is instructed to attack.
Shahed-136 has a wingspan of about 2.5m (8.2ft) and can be hard to detect on radar. 
It's unclear exactly how many Russia has, but the US has said Iran planned to send hundreds to Russia. Iran has denied doing so.
Russia was first reported to have used a Shahed-136 drone on 13 September, attacking targets near Kupiansk, a city in the Kharkiv region in the east of the country.
Later that month, it was used in attacks in the south. Debris from the drones were found in wreckage in Odesa and Mykolaiv. 
In October, Shahed-136 drones landed on civilian areas in the city of Bila Tserkva, south of Kyiv.
On 14 December, Ukrainian officials say they shot down over a dozen drones during a Russian attack on Kyiv.
Russia may be using these drones rather than cruise missiles because they are relatively cheap - about $20,000 (Â£17,800) each. 
Ukrainian armed forces have used small arms fire, heavy machine guns, portable anti-air missiles and electronic jamming devices to try and shoot down the drones. 
Ukraine's armed forces claimed on 25 October that they had shot down 223 Shahed-136 drones in the preceding 36 days, which is 85% of the total launched by Russia.
However, it is almost impossible to shoot down every single suicide drone, when they are sent in large numbers.
""They fly low and you can send them in waves. These swarms of drones are much harder to counter by air defences,"" military expert Justin Crump told the BBC.
It's not clear whether these have been used by Ukraine, but the US has said it is sending it 700 of its Switchblade kamikaze drones, and experts say kamikaze drones may have been deployed in recent attacks on a Russian military base in western Crimea, on an airbase near Sevastopol, and on ships in Sevastopol harbour.
Dr Marina Miron, researcher in defence studies at King's College London, says they may have been rudimentary drones made in Ukraine.
""If you look at the explosions in the attacks, they are quite small,"" she says. ""I suspect that these are homemade drones, which have had explosives strapped to them.""
Ukraine's main military drone is the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2. It is about the size of a small plane, has cameras on board, and can be armed with laser-guided bombs.
At the outset of the war, Ukraine had a fleet of ""fewer than 50"" of these, says Dr Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think-tank.
US said it is sending Ukraine 700 Switchblade drones, which are also kamikaze drones. 
Russia also uses the ""smaller, more basic"" Orlan-10, which have cameras and can carry small bombs. 
For both sides - Russia and Ukraine - drones have been effective for locating enemy targets and guiding artillery fire toward them.
""Russian forces can bring their guns to bear on the enemy within only three to five minutes of an Orlan-10 drone spotting a target,"" says Dr Watling. An attack could otherwise take 20-30 minutes to carry out.
Dr Marina Miron says drones have allowed Ukraine to stretch its limited forces.
""If you wanted to seek out enemy positions in the past, you would have had to send out special forces units... and you might lose some troops,"" she says. ""Now, all you're risking is a drone.""
In the first few weeks of the war, Ukraine's Bayraktar drones were widely praised.
""They were shown attacking targets such as ammunition dumps, and played a part in the sinking of the Moskva [warship],"" Dr Miron says. 
However, the Bayraktar is a large and slow moving drone, and Russia has been able to counter it effectively with its air defence systems.
Military drones are expensive to replace - a single Bayraktar TB2 costs about $2m (Â£1.7m).
So, both sides - but especially Ukraine - also use small, commercial models, such as the DJI Mavic 3, which costs about Â£1,700. 
mmercial drones can be fitted with small bombs. However, they are mainly used to spot enemy troops and to direct attacks.
""Ukraine doesn't have as much ammunition as Russia,"" says Dr Miron. ""Having 'eyes in the sky' to spot targets and direct artillery fire means they can make better use of what they have.""
But commercial drones are much less capable than military ones. 
For example, the DJI Mavic's total flying distance is only 30km, and it can only fly for a maximum of 46 minutes. 
Russia is using electronic devices to counter them, says Dr Miron.
""Russian forces have the Stupor rifle, which shoots electromagnetic pulses,"" she says. This stops commercial drones from being able to navigate using GPS, she explains.
Watch: The volunteers using drones to monitor Russian troops
Russian forces have also used online systems, such as Aeroscope, to detect and interrupt communications between commercial drones and their operators.

More than 1.7 million people have fled Ukraine because of the Russian invasion, according to the United Nations, many of whom have crossed to neighbouring countries such as Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova.
Horuna is one of the Ukrainian soldiers helping people who have been forced to leave their homes during the conflict. 
Horuna's life has changed dramatically since standing on an Olympic podium to receive his medal less than a year ago, but he believes that Ukraine ""will soon be back to normal life"". 
""Of course not all Ukraine as many cities are totally destroyed, some cities are half destroyed and of course those people who left their homes and cities, now they are refugees,"" he added. 
""Many of them have left the country and their lives changed completely. I stay in a relatively safe place and we are trying to help those people who have left their houses.""
Horuna is one of several Ukrainian sportspeople to have joined their nation's military effort, including tennis player Sergiy Stakhovsky, heavyweight champion boxer Oleksandr Usyk and three-weight champion fighter Vasiliy Lomachenko.
Brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, both former heavyweight world champions, are also defending their homeland.
When asked if he has been treated differently because of his sporting success, Horuna said: ""I consider myself just another man on the barricades. 
""I do the same that other people do. We stay together and we resist. We help each other, we are so united and stronger than ever before. 
""And I don't see anything heroic in my decision to join the army, because everyone here is doing the same.""
wo months before his achievement in Tokyo, Horuna became the European champion in his category by defeating Azerbaijan's five-time world champion Rafael Aghayev, and he has no doubt that he will return to his karate training in the near future. 
""I guess in 10 days, maybe two weeks we will win this war and my theory is life will get back to normal,"" he said. 
""And I will be able to visit my gym, my dojo and continue my regular training. And I will start the preparation for the next tournament or championship. 
""We will see - I hope and believe it will finish soon because Russian army is running out of resources."""	/sport/karate/60654026
health	Nurses to strike as ambulance crews plan walkouts	"About 10,000 NHS nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are to strike for the second time in less than a week in protest over their pay. 
Wednesday will see ambulance staff in England and Wales walk out too, unless a meeting later with the health secretary can avert it. 
Steve Barclay has invited three unions representing paramedics to talks.
It follows warnings of extensive disruption to services at a very challenging time of year for the NHS.
joint letter was sent out by health chiefs to NHS trusts and integrated care boards in England, urging hospitals to free-up beds by safely discharging patients ahead of industrial action by ambulance crews.
Measures should also be put in place to make sure ambulance patient handovers are kept to no more than 15 minutes, it advises.
retary will meet with ambulance unions later today, but will be discussing staffing measures rather than the issue of pay. 
re is no sign that ministers will adjust their stance over pay, the BBC's Nick Eardley said. The prime minister has told the Daily Mail he will keep making same argument that the current offer is fair and reasonable.
""I really urge the unions to consider the impact these strikes are having on people's lives and their health and to consider whether that's really appropriate,"" he said.
Nurses staged their biggest ever strike in the history of the NHS last week.
Nearly 10,000 staff were absent on Thursday and 16,000 appointments and surgeries had to be rescheduled in England alone.
uesday's 12-hour walkout, which starts at 08:00 GMT, could cause similar disruption, although services such as urgent cancer care, will continue. 
rike involves nurses in about a quarter of hospitals and community teams in England, all health boards in Northern Ireland and all but one health board in Wales. Nurses are not striking in Scotland.
Protected services include chemotherapy, emergency cancer services, dialysis, critical care units, neonatal and paediatric intensive care, along with some areas of mental health and learning disability and autism services.
walkout is mostly about pay. 
In England and Wales, most NHS staff have already received a pay rise of roughly Â£1,400 this year - worth about 4%, on average, for nurses.
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) union wants a 19% pay rise- 5% above the RPI inflation rate which currently stands at 14% - saying its members have received years of below-inflation pay increases.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the pay offer to nurses is appropriate and fair, despite pressure from health leaders and some former Conservative ministers to rethink.
But RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said he should ask himself why nurses are about to strike for the second time in their history.
Calling for talks with Mr Sunak, Ms Cullen said: ""Let's get this wrapped up by Christmas.
""I will negotiate with him at any point to stop nursing staff and patients going into the New Year facing such uncertainty.""
If there was no deal there would be more strikes next year, with more staff and further hospitals included, she warned on Radio 4's Today.
Ms Cullen said she was ""truly sorry"" for every patient whose care had been disrupted because of the nursing strikes.
However, she added that any disruption to a health service ""that's as fragile as ours"" is something that this government ""really needs to take a long, hard look at"".
government maintains the nurses' demands are unaffordable and the recommendation of an independent pay review body in setting wages have been followed.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay said it was ""disappointing"" union members were striking despite the impact on patients.
""The RCN's demands are unaffordable during these challenging times and would take money away from frontline services while they are still recovering from the impact of the pandemic,"" he said.
He added that he was ""open to engaging with the unions on how to make the NHS a better place to work"".
Nurses are not going to ""turn off care"" despite union members facing ""a desperate situation"" and ""living in poverty"", the RCN's Estephanie Dunn told BBC Breakfast.
Stephen Barclay needs to meet with unions and negotiate - with pay being the ""burning issue"" for members, she said. 
RCN has threatened to escalate strike action if ministers do not join talks within 48 hours of Tuesday's walkout.

urses will be followed on Wednesday by a strike by ambulance staff, when Unison, GMB and Unite members take action. GMB union members will go on strike again on 28 December.
Around 1,200 members of the military are being drafted in to cover the striking ambulance workers in a move unions call a ""desperate measure"". It is expected they will be handling less serious calls.
All of the most life-threatening calls, like cardiac arrest, will be responded too, but people who suffer trips, falls and other non-life threatening injuries may not be sent an ambulance.
North East Ambulance Service said it would not be able to respond to all calls of a serious nature and some patients would have to make their own way to hospital.
Stephen Segasby, from the service, said: ""Ambulances will still be able to respond during the strike, but this will only be where there is an immediate risk to life.
""This means that less serious calls will not receive a response and some patients might be asked to make their own way to hospital, where it is safe for them to do so.""
London Ambulance Service also warned that patients with conditions that were not life-threatening were unlikely to get an ambulance on strike days. 
rikes in the health service are part of widespread industrial action across a number of public sectors.
main union representing Border Force staff is set to walk out for eight days between 23 and 31 December.
Postal strikes will take place on 23 and 24 December - some of the busiest days for pre-Christmas deliveries. The RMT rail workers' union is also set to stage strike action between Christmas Eve and 27 December.

sports	Make Space for Girls encouraging more female skateboarding	"A campaign has been launched to encourage girls to try skateboarding by improving access to the sport.
Make Space for Girls, based in Frome, Somerset, aims to ensure skating facilities at parks and public spaces are suitable and welcoming for girls.
Founder Susannah Walker said more girls had taken-up the sport since Sky Brown's performances at the Olympics, but they were still in the minority.
""They do find it difficult to get onto the skate parks,"" added Ms Walker.
""A lot of it's down to design quite often [as] they're out in uncomfortable places, in the furthest, darkest corner of the park.
""It doesn't feel great or safe. We know lots more girls want to skateboard,"" Ms Walker said.
Among the improvements that the group has suggested include better lighting, wider entrances to play areas and having separate areas for varying levels of skill and experience.
Make Space for Girls says there are currently only about two or three skate parks - out of a total of 1,600 - in the country which have been designed to be inclusive. 
rity, which operates all across the UK, said its research had shown that girls they had spoken to avoided skate parks at busy times and had been made to feel unwelcome by other users.
Co-founder Imogen Clark said she helped set up the charity, and has launched the nationwide campaign, because of the ""discrimination girls face"" when trying to access skateboarding. 
""In reality, skate parks are dominated by boys,"" she said.
""Skateboarding is such a great sport, which doesn't just get people active, but can give them self-confidence, independence and resilience. Girls shouldn't be excluded from this,"" added Ms Clark.
Design company Wheelscape has been helping the charity come up with some inclusive skate park designs, with initial consultations having a ""very good response"", the charity said.

politics	Bolsover: Labour candidate Jerry Hague stands down	"A solicitor who admitted professional misconduct over his firm's handling of miners' compensation claims has stood down as a Labour candidate. 
Jerry Hague announced ""with sadness"" he would not be standing for the party in Bolsover, Derbyshire.
It came after The Times revealed Mr Hague had been fined Â£5,000 in 2010 after appearing before the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.
Bolsover was held by former miner Dennis Skinner for 49 years.
ran politician - known as the Beast of Bolsover -  lost his seat to the Conservatives in 2019.
It was one of several so-called ""red wall"" Labour constituencies in the Midlands and north of England to be won by Tories in Boris Johnson's landslide election victory. 
uency includes many former pit communities which have struggled since the closure of the mines.
Mr Hague was a partner at Graysons, a Sheffield law firm, which handled compensation claims against British Coal by former miners suffering from lung disease from breathing in coal dust and vibration white finger, a condition caused by working with vibrating machinery such as chain saws and drills.
In 1998, the firm agreed a deal with the National Union of Mineworkers that gave them access to potential clients - and was designed to ensure former miners and their families faced no liability if their compensation claim failed.
But clients also had to enter into a ""funding agreement"" with the NUM, which meant they had to pay a ""fixed sum of money"" to the union out of any compensation won, according to the tribunal findings, which have been seen by the BBC.
In 2010, Mr Hague was one of four Graysons solicitors to admit breaking conduct rules by failing to give clients adequate advice about costs and the ""merits"" of the NUM funding agreement.
Labour Party is understood to have been unaware of Mr Hague's misconduct case during the candidate selection process and spoke to him after the details came to light. 
rty is understood to agree he cannot remain as the candidate. 
In a statement, Mr Hague said: ""With sadness I am standing down as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the Bolsover constituency.
""It has been an honour to be selected by local party members and the decision I have come to is based upon the interests of the Labour Party.
""I would like to thank everyone for their support throughout my campaign and look forward to offering my backing to the Bolsover CLP [constituency Labour party] and the candidate it will go on to choose.""

technology	Jeremy Vine: My jailed stalker Alex Belfield says he'll be back	"Jeremey Vine: Stalker's YouTube was ""a fountain of hate""
Broadcaster Jeremy Vine has hit out at social media firms as he said his stalker had put out a video promising to be back.
Alex Belfield was sentenced to five and a half years last week, after being found guilty of stalking four people.
He posted videos and messages online about his victims and encouraged his followers to target them.
Vine told BBC Two's Newsnight social media firms ""don't care"" about hosting such material, leaving him ""broken"".
BBC Radio 2 presenter, 57, said Belfield - a 42-year-old former BBC local radio presenter - had taken him to a ""really unhealthy place"" and described his YouTube channel as a ""fountain of hate"".
He said: ""I was afraid of what he could do to my family. I was afraid because you have to think around corners with this stuff. 
""And, you know, we've seen knife attacks on MPs, MPs being killed, people who are prominent being attacked. So I'm not trying to give myself undue status here, but I had to think this through.""
Asked about the behaviour of social media giants YouTube and Twitter during the ordeal, Vine said he had been ""amazed"" how difficult it was to get YouTube to take action.
""They take down individual videos and then when he's convicted, they demonetised him. But half the videos about me are still out there,"" he said.
Because Belfield told his viewers to copy and share the videos, they will ""always be out there"", Vine said, adding ""I've got to live with that"".
""But the fact that YouTube hosts this stuff, they have no responsibility. They don't care,"" the journalist said. 
He said he was ""disgusted by their lack of values"" and also criticised Twitter as he said Belfield still possessed an account despite being in prison.
Vine said Belfield had put out a video saying he was going to be back up and running.
He added while there were now restraining orders in eight people's cases he thought the one thing you could do was ""deprive people of their platform"".
g judge, Mr Justice Saini, told Belfield one of his victims had been ""seconds away from taking his own life as a result of your conduct"".
Vine told Newsnight he thought if the courts had not stopped Belfield ""somebody would have died"".
He said he feared that at some point one of the 400,000 people watching Belfield's videos was ""going to take a knife or acid to my home"".
""The danger came from the online traffic, not from the individual,"" he said, adding Belfield wanted to ""create so much hatred against me that someone acted by proxy"". 
Vine said he had to take it seriously as Belfield had put his home address out.
""I've got two teenage daughters, you know, I can't be casual about it. So at that point I was scared for them,"" he said.
While Belfield never physically approached him, Vine said his actions had been worse than when he had had a physical stalker. 
""That was a picnic compared to this, because what happened in this case is that you were fired on from all directions. Every time you open your phone he's there,"" he said.
According to YouTube, following a review several videos have been removed from Belfield's ""Voice of Reason"" channel for violating its policies.
A YouTube spokesperson said: ""Monetisation on the Voice of Reason channel remains suspended for violating our creator responsibility policy. 
""Our community guidelines prohibit content that threatens individuals and we have removed several videos for violating these policies.""

entertainment	Dua Lipa: Singer denies she is performing at Qatar World Cup	"Dua Lipa has denied reports she will perform at the Fifa Men's World Cup opening ceremony in Qatar on Sunday.
ger said she will ""look forward to visiting Qatar when it has fulfilled all the human rights pledges it made"" when it became host. 
Qatar has been criticised for its stance on same-sex relationships, its human rights record and its treatment of migrant workers.
Other acts including Robbie Williams and BTS's Jung Kook are set to perform.
In February 2021, the Guardian said 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had died in Qatar since it won its World Cup bid.
However, the Qatar government has said the total is misleading, because not all the deaths recorded were of people working on World Cup-related projects.
Lipa posted an Instagram story on Sunday, which read: ""There is currently a lot of speculation that I will be performing at the opening ceremony of the World Cup in Qatar.
""I will not be performing and nor have I ever been involved in any negotiation to perform.
""I will be cheering England on from afar... One love, Dua.""
Watch: Ros Atkins onâ¦ How Qatar got to host the World Cup
Lipa, born in London to Kosovar-Albanian parents, is not the first major name to make a point of not playing in Qatar.
Sir Rod Stewart recently revealed he turned down the opportunity.
""I was actually offered a lot of money, over $1m, to play there 15 months ago. I turned it down. It's not right to go,"" he told the Sunday Times.
""And the Iranians [football team] should be out [of the World Cup] too for supplying arms"", he added, in reference to Iran's supply of explosive drones to Russia, which Iran has denied. 
Russia was suspended from all competitions by Fifa and Uefa in February, after the country's invasion of Ukraine.
Other musical acts like US pop/rap group Black Eyed Peas and Colombian singer J Balvin, however, are also set to perform at events in Qatar during the tournament.
Comedian Joe Lycett, meanwhile, has issued an ultimatum to Qatar World Cup ambassador David Beckham.
Lycett has promised to donate Â£10,000 of his own money to charity, if Beckham ends his reported multimillion-pound deal with Qatar.
Homosexuality is illegal in the country, where same-sex relationships can be punishable by the death sentence.
If the former footballer refuses, then Lycett has threatened to shred the Â£10,000 - just before the World Cup opening ceremony.
Lycett says Beckham's ""status as a gay icon"" will also be shredded if he doesn't end his relationship with Qatar.
BBC has contacted David Beckham for comment, and his management responded: ""We aren't commenting at this time."" 
Beckham has been urged to speak out on the criminalisation of same-sex relations in Qatar.
Speaking to the BBC last year, a source close to the star said: ""Of course David wanted to ensure that he was informed about the facts and any concerns that he might have for his gay friends, football supporters and fans.
""Some of the laws and beliefs in the region differ to his own but the Qataris have always said that everyone will be safe and welcome at the World Cup in 2022 and he believes that commitment is sincere and has seen evidence of proactive engagement with the international LBGTQ community by the World Cup organisers.""
Qatar World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman made headlines last week after it emerged he had referred to homosexuality as ""damage in the mind"".
Human Rights Watch called the former Qatar international's comments ""harmful and unacceptable"".
Rasha Younes, LGBT rights senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: ""The failure of the Qatari government to counter this false information has a significant impact on the lives of LGBT residents of Qatar, ranging from fuelling discrimination and violence against them to justifying subjecting them to state-sponsored conversion practices.""
Organisers have said no-one coming to watch the tournament will be discriminated against.
Beckham's former England and Manchester United teammate Gary Neville recently appeared as a guest presenter on the long-running BBC topical news quiz, Have I Got News For You, and was questioned by team captain Ian Hislop over his decision to travel to Qatar to commentate on the World Cup.
""My view always has been that you either highlight the issues and challenges in these countries and speak about them, or you don't say anything and you stay back home and don't go,"" said Neville. ""I've always said we should challenge them.""
which Hislop replied: ""There's another option - you stay at home and highlight the abuses. 
""You don't have to go and take the Qataris' money. I'm not trying to be tiresome, but it is just not a very good defence."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63620686
politics	Rishi Sunak must not unleash wave of austerity - Sturgeon	"Nicola Sturgeon says public services would not stand further austerity
Rishi Sunak must not unleash a new wave of austerity on the UK, Scotland's first minister has said.
Nicola Sturgeon congratulated the former chancellor on winning the race to be prime minster, but urged him to call an early general election.
She said public services would not stand further austerity and added it was time for a ""fundamental rethink"".
Mr Sunak is expected to take office on Tuesday after formally meeting King Charles III.
He will become the UK's first British Asian prime minister after Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt pulled out of the Tory leadership contest.
Nearly 200 Conservative MPs publicly backed him to succeed Liz Truss, ahead of the nomination deadline on Monday.
Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland she would do her very best to ""build a constructive working relationship"" with the next prime minister.
But she said: ""He absolutely should not unleash another wave of austerity. 
""Our public services, the Scottish government's budget, we're still dealing with the legacy of the first wave of Tory austerity.
""We are dealing with the problem of soaring inflation. Our public services cannot stand another round.""
She added: ""People, businesses, families across the country already dealing with the cost of living crisis cannot withstand this - it is time for a fundamental rethink.""
Mr Sunak warned of the ""profound economic challenge"" ahead in his first speech after winning the Tory leadership contest.
But Scotland's first minister said the country should not be trapped in a ""Tory mindset"" that there was no alternative to the current ""economic mayhem"".
""It's been caused by Brexit and there's a real need for Rishi Sunak - who was a Brexiteer - to face up to that,"" she said.
""Brexit is doing the economy real damage and that's been compounded by the decisions Liz Truss took that brought the UK economy to its knees.""
Challenged on how she would do things differently, Ms Sturgeon highlighted that an independent Scotland would inherit the economic position of the UK.
""Scotland is a wealthy country, we have amazing resources, not least our renewable energy,"" she said.
""Dealing with the fiscal situation in a humane way, in a civilised way, in a way that protects public services and gets the economy growing based on our sustainable resources is the way to do it - not another round of austerity.""
Liz Truss said she would ""ignore"" Nicola Sturgeon as prime minister - and it was perhaps the one pledge she ended up standing by, as she never had a formal meeting or even a phone call.
Rishi Sunak may well look to reach out, but his words about Ms Sturgeon haven't been much warmer - talking about her and the SNP as an ""existential threat"" to the union.
Ultimately the personalities may not be what defines the relationship. There are huge policy issues looming between the two, from the best way to nurse the economy back to health to how best to support families through the cost of living crisis.
Mr Sunak has talked of running ""the most active UK-wide government in decades"" - something sure to wind up Scottish ministers. And all of that comes before you get to the independence referendum Ms Sturgeon has pencilled in for next October.
Regardless of how the personal relationship plays out, these two political leaders are likely to be at odds from day one.
Opposition parties have called for a general election as Mr Sunak prepares to take office as the third Conservative prime minister since the UK last went to the polls in 2019.
Mr Sunak addressed Tory MPs after the result was announced. In the speech - which took place behind closed doors - Mr Sunak ruled out an early election, MP Simon Hoare said.
However, Ms Sturgeon said: ""He's the second person in a row to be appointed to the position by Tories, not elected by the population. 
""The idea that he can go two years before seeking or winning a democratic mandate is unthinkable.""
She added: ""He hasn't been elected, and probably wouldn't be elected in Scotland if we were given the chance.
""He's another prime minister with no democratic legitimacy in Scotland.""
Watch: Rishi Sunak makes first public address since winning Tory leadership contest
Commenting on Mr Sunak's opposition to her plans for another Scottish independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said it was for the people of Scotland to decide.
""Scottish democracy will not be the prisoner of Rishi Sunak or any British prime minister,"" she said.
Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross earlier congratulated Rishi Sunak on his victory.
And Conservative MP David Mundell told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime that he was sure Mr Sunak would soon make a phone call to Nicola Sturgeon, unlike the current incumbent at Number 10.
MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale said: ""I think she will hear from the prime minister, just as I think that Mark Drakeford in Wales and the leaders of Northern Ireland will.
""It's very important that the prime minister works closely with devolved administrations on areas of common interest.
""I think that we will see a constructive approach from Rishi Sunak.""
Scotland's Conservative leader Douglas Ross wants his ""party to unite behind PM""
Meanwhile, Scots businessman Charan Gill - who made his fortune with the Ashoka Indian restaurant chain - told Drivetime he was ""very happy"" to see the UK's first British Asian prime minister.
""The significance of the event today is more important to me than the politics of the situation,"" he said.
""Being an immigrant to this country, I came here 50-odd years ago, one of these people who thought he would never see this day.
""This is a historical milestone which I never thought we would reach"""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63374655
sports	World Triathlon Championship Series: Alex Yee miss out as Leo Bergere wins world title	"Britain's Olympic relay champion Alex Yee narrowly missed out on the world triathlon title by finishing fourth in the series finale in Abu Dhabi.
24-year-old was second in the standings behind New Zealand's Hayden Wilde going into the race. 
But although he finished two places ahead of Wilde, it wasn't enough as France's Leo Bergere triumphed.
It saw Bergere overtake both rivals in the standings and become world champion with Yee second overall.
""I just gave everything out there,"" said Yee, who won the Commonwealth individual and mixed relay titles in Birmingham in July.
""I was really suffering with cramp on the second lap of the run and just didn't have it in the end. It's been an amazing year and when reflecting on that as the outcome of the year, I've been really proud of what I've achieved and second in the world is not bad.""
It was a first World Triathlon Championship series win for Bergere who finished in one hour 44 minutes and 14 seconds - 11 seconds clear of American Morgan Pearson while Yee, who won relay gold and individual silver at the Tokyo Olympics, was outpaced by Belgium's Jelle Geens in a sprint finish for third.
Bergere was in the top 10 out of the water and among a group of nine athletes who dominated the bike section as they built up a lead of more than 30 seconds on the chasing pack, which included Yee.
Frenchman took the lead from Britain's Jonny Brownlee early in the 10km run and controlled the race after that.
Brownlee faded after that and eventually came in 26th, two minutes and 24 seconds behind Bergere.
""It's insane,"" said Bergere. ""I don't know what to say. I didn't want to do the maths before the race, I just wanted to race all out and try to break away."""	/sport/triathlon/63768104
technology	'Merry Christmas': 30 years of the text message	"xt message is celebrating its 30th birthday - the first was sent to a mobile phone by a Vodafone engineer in Berkshire in the UK on 3 December 1992.
It was sent in order to test out the tech, and read ""Merry Christmas"".
Neil Papworth sent it to one of the firm's bosses, Richard Jarvis, who was at a Christmas party. He did not get a reply.
Mr Jarvis's phone, a new-to-the-market Orbitel 901, weighed 2.1kg - roughly the same as 12 standard iPhone 14s.
At its peak, phone users exchanged billions of SMS - or Short Message Service - messages every year, and in 2010 the word ""texting"" entered the dictionary.
rvice is still used, although internet-based, encrypted messaging platforms like WhatsApp and iMessage are far more popular.
According to Statista, there were 40 billion SMS messages sent in 2021 in the UK, down from 150bn in 2012. By contrast, there are 100 billion WhatsApp messages sent worldwide every day.
rvice is still used by the NHS to send out appointment reminders, and by some firms as a form of log-in authentication, where a number sequence is sent which has to be entered into its website. 
However, SMS messages are not end-to-end encrypted, and therefore not considered to be secure. 
Originally, an SMS could only be text, up to 160 characters long. The concept was born in the early 1980s but it was almost 10 years before one would be sent to a mobile device.
Most early phones had numeric keyboards, with two or three letters attached to each number - so for example to type the letter C, the number one key had to be pressed three times.
""Handset manufacturers didn't include proper QWERTY keyboards because mobiles were only for making telephone calls and receiving messages, but not sending them,"" said Nigel Linge, professor of telecommunications at the University of Salford.
Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, recalled giving training sessions on how to send and receive text messages.
""It took off like wildfire and before long people were getting so fast at texting on phones, they could pretty much touch-type on a numeric keyboard,"" he said.
""These days people spend more time looking at their phones than talking into them. SMS was arguably the catalyst for that transition.""

health	More diagnostic hubs to tackle NHS waiting lists in England	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to leave no stone unturned in the government's attempts to tackle mounting problems in the NHS.
With the backlog in hospital treatment rising and delays in A&E and ambulance response times worsening, Mr Sunak said he would get on top of the challenges.
It comes as a taskforce has been set up to make more use of the private sector and reduce waiting lists.
Mr Sunak told BBC News: ""What people want is action.""
He said: ""What people want from their politicians is action to make a difference to their lives - and I am here to tell you we are going to make that difference.""
Mr Sunak highlighted the extra money being made available - a Â£500m winter fund is being distributed to hospitals - to increase bed capacity and provide more support in the community.
would help reduce the problems in emergency care, including waiting times for ambulances, he said.
And tackling the backlog in routine treatment - more than seven million people are currently waiting for treatment in England - was a key priority.
government is setting up 19 more diagnostic centres in communities across England to help tackle the Covid backlog.
Ninety one are already open and have delivered more than 2.4 million tests, checks and scans since last summer, ministers say.
It is hoped the centres will speed up access to services for patients, thereby reducing waiting times.
Although the number of people waiting longer than two years for routine operations in England has fallen dramatically since January, health experts say there is still a mountain to climb to reduce the numbers waiting more than a year. 
Winter is likely to bring more delays and pressure, particularly with strikes by NHS nurses and ambulance workers also planned in December. 
A taskforce, made up of academics and health experts, has been set up to help reduce reduce waiting times by unlocking space in private hospitals. It met for the first time at 10 Downing Street on Wednesday.
GPs can refer patients to community diagnostic centres so that they can access life-saving checks and scans, and be diagnosed for a range of conditions, without travelling to hospital. 
Some are located in football stadiums and shopping centres and can offer MRI and CT scans, as well as x-rays.
In September, according to the government, the hubs delivered 11% of all diagnostic activity - and its ambition is for 40% to be achieved by 2025.
government wants to eliminate 18-month waits by April 2023, and waits of longer than one year by March 2025.
It has committed to investing an extra Â£8bn into health and social care in 2024-25.
NHS England's national director of elective recovery, Sir James Mackey, said NHS staff were working ""incredibly hard"" to tackle the Covid backlog, adding that it was important to continue to use the independent sector to get waiting lists down."	/news/health-63877830

Officers reportedly beat Ms Amini's head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered ""sudden heart failure"".
Anti-government protests continued for an eight straight night on Friday, while pro-regime rallies also took place in Tehran and other cities. 
Mr Blinken said the partial relaxation of internet restrictions was a ""concrete step to provide meaningful support to Iranians demanding that their basic rights be respected"". It was clear, he added, that the Iranian government was ""afraid of its own people"".
US treasury said the move would help counter the Iranian government's attempt to ""surveil and censor"" its people.
But it is unlikely to have an immediate impact as it ""does not remove every tool of communications repression"".
Billionaire Elon Musk said on Twitter that he would activate his satellite internet firm, Starlink, to provide internet services to Iran in response to Mr Blinken's announcement.
Starlink provides internet services via a huge network of satellites and is aimed at people who live in remote areas who cannot get high-speed internet.
US officials said that the updated license did not cover hardware supplied by Mr Musk but his firm and others were welcome to apply for permission to the treasury.
Footage shared on social media on Friday showed large crowds of protesters gather in several Tehran neighbourhoods after dark, while other incidents occurred elsewhere the country. In the protests women have defiantly taken off their hijabs and burned them, or cut off their hair in front of cheering crowds. 
While spreading across much of the country, many of the early protests were concentrated in western Iran, particularly areas with large Kurdish populations, the group Ms Amini belonged to.  
On Friday, reports emerged from Oshnavieh, in Iran's West Azerbaijan Province, which borders Kurdistan, showing widespread protests, as well as suggestions demonstrators had taken control of large parts of the city. The BBC was unable to confirm this. 
Videos posted from Oshnavieh showed large crowds of people marching through city streets with no police presence, while loud explosions could be heard. 
Friday also saw pro-regime demonstrations in Tehran and other cities, with those present declaring support for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been a target of anti-government protesters. 
President Ebrahim Raisi spoke at a pro-government event, saying he would not allow the country's security to be ""threatened"". 
""We will not allow people's security to be put at risk under any circumstances,"" he said, shortly after returning from the United Nations General Assembly in New York. 
Stressing that Iran's ""enemies"" wanted to exploit the unrest, Mr Raisi said the government would listen to criticism over Ms Amini's death, but would not be influenced by ""rioting"".

entertainment	Neath: The rock choir bringing women together	"A choir started in 2016 by a woman after her son's second open-heart surgery has become an ensemble of 200 women.
Valley Rock Voices in Neath is a choir of women aged between 21 and 80.
Founder Cerys Llewellyn-Bevan has created a community for women from all backgrounds and all ages, including mothers to grandmothers.
""We are a huge melting pot of every kind of woman,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan.
Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan started the choir with 12 friends as what she described as an ""antidote"" to her son Sam's second major operation. 
Now 26, Sam has recovered well.
From the choir, a collective has formed with activities such as walking, swimming, social and fund-raising groups.
""When you become a mum your life becomes all about your children growing up, and I think a lot of women lose the ability to go out and make friends,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan.
""I needed to get out and find some joy again, and going back to my music-making seemed to be the obvious path as it had brought me much joy previously.""
53-year-old has a classical music background and had stints as head of music at various schools.
r's repertoire includes the Bee Gees, The Killers, Katy Perry, Primal Scream and Stormzy. 
re due to perform at Swansea Arena in March with Max Boyce and tenor Wynne Evans.
Day-long ""boot camps"" are held on top of regular rehearsals at Neath Town Hall and St Peter's Church in Newton, Bridgend county. 
r fell silent when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in March 2020. 
""For nine months we didn't meet,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan. 
""I honestly thought I would never put the choir back together again.
""In November 2020, restrictions started to be eased slightly so I decided to venture out and see if I had anyone who fancied a challenge.""
When restrictions allowed, the choir rehearsed outdoors at Neath RFC, in the rugby stands, socially distanced and groups of 15 at a time.
Bethan Comerford, from Neath, knew Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan from school and found out about the choir on Facebook.
""Up from the sofa I got - my husband said, 'what are you doing?' I said, 'I'm going to join a choir',"" said Ms Comerford.
""It was just what I needed. It's the best thing I have ever done.""
But Ms Comerford's husband died shortly after she joined. 
""It was the middle of Covid, and every night there would be food parcels delivered by people here,"" said the 54-year-old. 
""They were fantastic, and they still are. They're such a great bunch of women.""
Joining the choir has also been of major benefit for its youngest member, Imogen Fish, from Neath. 
Now 21, Ms Fish has done GCSEs, A levels and completed a university degree while with Valley Rock Voices. She is now training to become a teacher.
""When I first started I was so shy,"" she said. 
""I wouldn't speak to anybody or look at anybody. I was going through a tricky time at school. Now I'm a totally different person.""
Joan Powell - the choir's oldest member at 80 - joined on its first day.
""When you get older you don't make lifelong friends so easily, but I have,"" she said. 
""I have formed some beautiful friendships. Everybody takes care of each other. We watch each other's backs."""	/news/uk-wales-64062640

Harry Hopwood, from Billericay, said he was ""extremely worried"" about his father's condition on the ward, after he discovered the heating was not working when he visited on Monday.

politics	Climate change: Household rubbish to be turned into jet fuel	"Waste gases from a steelworks and household rubbish could be used to fuel aeroplanes for ""guilt-free flying"".
It comes as five projects have been awarded a share of a Â£165m UK government fund.
rojects will cut CO2 emissions by an average of 200,000 tonnes a year, once fully up and running.
Department of Transport said the project will also produce 300,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel a year. 
UK government said this was ""enough to fly to the moon and back about 60 times"" and equates to around 14,331,300 miles (23,063,991 km).
One of the projects will be based at Port Talbot steelworks and will convert steel mill off-gases into fuel.
Another scheme will develop a plant creating duel using carbon captured from a gas-fired power station and hydrogen made from renewable electricity.
r successful projects include sustainable fuel plants in Teesside, Immingham and Ellesmere Port, which will cover domestic and commercial waste. 
UK government Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: ""Using waste or by-products to refuel airliners sounds like a flight of fancy, but... it's going to help us make guilt-free flying a reality.
""It's exactly this kind of innovation that will help us create thousands of green jobs across the country and slash our carbon emissions."" 
A Welsh government spokesman called it ""great news"", adding: ""We are committed to helping create green jobs in the new industries of the future, which will help us deliver our ambition of creating a stronger, fairer and greener economy.

business	UK economy shrank more than previously thought	"UK economy shrank by more than first thought in the three months to September, revised figures show. 
my contracted by 0.3%, compared with a previous estimate of 0.2%, as business investment performed worse than first thought, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Growth figures for the first half of 2022 have also been revised down.
UK is forecast to fall into recession in the final three months of the year as soaring prices hit growth. 
A country is considered to be in recession when its economy shrinks for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. Typically companies make less money, pay falls and unemployment rises, leaving the government with less money in tax to use on public services.
Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""Our revised figures show the economy performed slightly less well over the last year than we previously estimated"", with manufacturing ""notably weaker"".
He added that household incomes, when accounting for rising prices, continued to fall, and household spending ""fell for the first time since the final Covid-19 lockdown in the spring of 2021"". 
ONS said that gross domestic product (GDP) - the measure of the size of the economy - was now estimated to be 0.8% below where it was before the pandemic struck, downwardly revised from the previous estimate of 0.4% below.
my has been hit as surging energy and food prices push inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to its highest level in 40 years. 
It means that consumers are spending less and businesses are cutting investment.
Along with its revision for the July-to-September period, the ONS said the economy also grew less than first estimated in the first half of the year - expanding by 0.6% in the first quarter and 0.1% in the second quarter.
ONS has previously said growth stood at 0.7% and 0.2% in those quarters respectively.
It is not unusual for the ONS to revise its growth estimates. It produces a first estimate of GDP about 40 days after the quarter in question, at which point only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised later as more information comes in.
We already knew the UK economy shrank in the third quarter of the year while other economies grew. But now the disparity between the UK and the rest of the world looks starker than previously thought. 
An economy that remains 0.8% smaller than its pre-pandemic level is in marked contrast to the eurozone - up 2.2% at the last count - or Canada - up by 3%. 
Paris-based think tank the OECD recently forecast in 2023, the UK economy would continue shrinking by more than the rest of the G7, while other economies returned to growth. 
re's now a growing body of evidence that some of that underperformance is due to Brexit. 
Last week, figures from the ONS indicated that the economy shrank by 0.3% over the August-to-October period.
government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has warned that the UK will fall into a recession ""lasting just over a year"".
OBR has predicted that the economy will shrink by 1.4% in 2023 before growth gradually picks up again.
As a result it expects the unemployment rate to rise and house prices to fall sharply as the Bank of England puts up interest rates to control soaring prices. 
Last week, the Bank raised its key rate to 3.5%, the highest level for 14 years, which is pushing up repayment costs for people with mortgages and loans.
UK is not the only country seeing its economy slow down, with the US and eurozone also expected to fall into recession next year. 
However, Gabriella Dickens from Pantheon Macroeconomics said she expected the UK to ""suffer the deepest recession among major advanced economies in 2023"".
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt blamed Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine for the economic difficulties.
""High inflation driven by Putin's invasion of Ukraine is slowing economic growth across the world. No country is immune, least of all Britain,"" he said.
But responding to the latest ONS figures, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves accused the government of losing control over the economy.
""GDP data has been revised down, leaving the UK with the worst growth in the G7 in the last quarter,"" she tweeted.
""The Tories have lost control of the economy and are leaving millions of working people paying the price."""	/news/business-64062548
sports	Celtic: 'No great urgency' for more January signings - Ange Postecoglou	"Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou sees ""no great urgency"" to move back into the transfer market having made three signings ahead of the January window.
Midfielder Tomoki Iwata was secured from Postecoglou's former club, Yokohama F Marinos, on Friday.
Defenders Alistair Johnston and Yuki Kobayashi will also officially join the Scottish champions on 1 January and could debut against Rangers on Monday.
""That was probably our priority at this stage,"" Postecoglou says.
""I'm really pleased with the three boys we have brought in. But the transfer window hasn't even opened yet, so what we have got to obviously be aware of is there might be departures as well.""
Johnston's arrival from Montreal means they already have a replacement should Josip Juranovic leave after the right-back's impressive World Cup performances for Croatia attracted admirers, while Kobayashi's capture from Vissel Kobe adds to the competition in central defence.
""I guess the pleasing thing from my perspective is that we are in a good position now with three incomings, so whatever happens, we can make decisions that are best for the football club,"" Postecoglou says.
""We will see what January brings. My view on these things is that, if a good opportunity comes up that will make us stronger, and it makes sense for us, then we will move on it.""
With Anthony Ralston still missing with a back problem and Juranovic yet to feature since his return from Qatar, Johnston could be handed a derby debut as long as international clearance is forthcoming.
""Tomoki is in Japan, so there is zero chance he will play,"" Postecoglou says. ""With Alistair and Kobayashi, they are available like everyone else.""
Sead Haksabanovic misses out again with a foot injury, as does fellow midfielder David Turnbull through suspension as Celtic visit the side sitting nine points behind in second place. 
Postecoglou says the 4-0 win over Rangers at Celtic Park earlier in the season and the 2-1 win at Ibrox on their last visit in April would have less bearing on his team selection and strategy than the arrival of Michael Beale as manager at Ibrox.
""We've played in all these fixtures with the same kind of mindset,"" he adds. ""Traditionally, these kinds of games tend to be tight - it's exciting and one you are looking forward to.
""My decisions on picking a team are what's happening currently and even the last game becomes just a reference point. Michael has come in, he's changed the shape slightly, he's tried different personnel, so all those things are factored into it."""	/sport/football/64134779

health	Mental health patients sent miles due to bed shortage	"Hundreds of mental health patients in England are sent to hospitals miles from home each month because of local bed shortages - more than a year after the NHS aimed to end the practice.
NHS data shows that 630 patients were in inappropriate out of area placements (OAPs) at the end of August 2022.
Experts say such placements, which the NHS said would end by March 2021, are traumatic for patients and costly.
government said it was investing an extra Â£2.3bn in mental health services.
An inappropriate OAP is when someone is sent to a hospital in a different area because no beds are free locally. 
Of the 630 patients in inappropriate OAPs in August 2022, more than half were sent away that month. 
In 2019, Kelly was sectioned and - because no local bed was free - sent to a hospital 23 miles from her home. 
""I didn't have anything on me"", she says, ""I only had my phone and the clothes that I was in.""
With family members too far away to bring her possessions, the hospital provided basics: pyjamas, trousers, a T-shirt, one pair of socks and two pieces of underwear. 
""All I could wear were the pyjamas and the same top and trousers every day for three weeks,"" says Kelly.
""It was just awful. When you're stuck in a strange place as it is... It's even more distressing not having your own familiar things to take comfort in.""
Shortly after her discharge, Kelly was sectioned again - this time closer to home. She says this made a ""massive difference"", adding: ""When you're closer to home you've got your friends and your family coming to visit you and take you out for a walk.""
Paul Spencer, the charity Mind's head of health, policy & campaigns, describes OAPs as traumatic, isolating and costly to the NHS. He says that ""people are cut off from their support networks right at the very moment they need them most"".
More than half of patients are sent more than 60 miles (100km) from home. 
Dr Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says ""statistically, if you're sent away from your local area, you stay in hospital longer"".
""For some areas it looks like there aren't enough beds and for some areas, it is that there aren't alternatives to admission. Focusing on care in the community is really important,"" says Dr James.
Almost Â£10m was spent on inappropriate OAPs in August, with 94% of placement days spent with private organisations. Private beds are often more expensive.
NHS had planned to eliminate inappropriate OAPs in adult acute inpatient care by 2020-21. 
Since that deadline, 5,800 patients have been sent on inappropriate OAPs. This has cost the NHS more than Â£165m. 
""It's incredibly disheartening to see progress stall on reversing the number of inappropriate OAPs"", says Mr Spencer. 
""We know that it is possible to stop OAPs and some trusts are doing much better than others. Over the coming year we need a sharper focus in those areas where people are being repeatedly let down. 
""We need the prime minister to urgently recommit to delivering a cross-government mental health plan.""
An NHS spokesperson said: ""Mental health services are committed to ending inappropriate OAPs as quickly and as safely as possible and the number of new patients sent out of area has halved over the last three years.
""While the pandemic has led to a significant increase in service pressures through a combination of a high number of bed closures, staff absences, and higher levels of mental health need - the NHS has treated tens of thousands more people in the community since the publication of the NHS Long Term Plan and will continue to work with social care colleagues to reduce rising length of stay in mental health settings."" 
Across England, patients spent a total of 191,515 inappropriate OAPs days in the year ending this August, down 19% from the year before. 
But 25 trusts saw an increase in the number of days patients spent in OAPs, with 12 trusts recording their highest figure of OAP days yet. 
When Claire, not her real name, was suicidal in 2020, she was sent to a private hospital 80 miles away. She spent 18 months there. 
""I had no idea where I was going. They said there were no beds in our local area and brought me to East Sussex. I've never stepped foot in East Sussex before,"" she says.
""I was terrified. I was hundreds of miles away from my family. I was asking to go home, to see my mum. I didn't know the psychiatrists, I didn't know the people there.""
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Everyone should have access to safe, appropriate mental health care close to home, and while the pandemic has had a significant impact on capacity in mental health services, we remain committed to reducing inappropriate OAPs for patients.""
rtment said it is investing an extra Â£2.3bn annually in mental health services by 2024. NHS England is providing an extra Â£10m to support mental health services this winter to ""deal with record demand"".
If you are affected by issues raised, support is available at the BBC Action Line.

Gatland replaced Wayne Pivac as Wales head coach earlier this month and has been assembling his coaching team.
Attack coach Jones and defence expert Jenkins follow Pivac out of the door but forwards coach Jonathan Humphreys will keep his job.
Kicking coach Neil Jenkins is also to remain in the set-up.
Former Wales attack coach Rob Howley, currently involved in the Canadian coaching set-up, has been touted for a reunion with Gatland in his second stint in charge.
Ex-England defence coach Paul Gustard, currently employed by Stade Francais, is another who has been linked with the new Wales set-up, while former Wales flanker Jonathan Thomas is also tipped to be in contention for a role.
Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) say the search is ongoing for new attack and defence coaches, with both positions expected to be filled in January.
""We are delighted both Jonathan and Neil will stay on and be a part of Warren's new team,"" said WRU chief executive Steve Phillips.
""The very nature of a changeover at the helm of a national team brings with it the possibility for change and evolution elsewhere in the backroom staff.
""I know both Stephen and Gethin understand this part of the process and they should be commended for the good grace with which they have accepted the decision. 
""We have appointed a very experienced and senior head coach, one of the best coaches in the world game and Wales' most successful ever coach, and it is important to now ensure he is afforded the very best opportunity to succeed.  
""That means giving our maximum support as Warren seeks to build the right team around him - with the right blend of skills and character to suit his own style - to achieve success for Wales in the short amount of time available and we look forward to making further positive appointments in the new year.""
Jones started in the Wales set-up under Gatland after being a late replacement before the 2019 World Cup in Japan for Howley, who was sent home before the tournament because of betting offences he had committed.
Jones, who won 104 caps for Wales at fly-half, worked alongside Pivac after the duo helped Scarlets win the Pro12 title in 2017.
gh point of Jones' involvement in the national coaching set-up was in the 2021 Six Nations triumph, when Wales scored a record 20 tries.
Former prop Jenkins played 129 internationals for Wales and five Tests for the British and Irish Lions before retiring in 2018. Gatland also chose Jenkins to captain Wales.
After coaching spells with Cardiff RFC and Wales Under-20s, Jenkins replaced Sam Warburton and joined Pivac's backroom staff in 2020 to work alongside Byron Hayward.
When Hayward was dismissed, Jenkins was given the defence coach job on a permanent basis ahead of the 2021 Six Nations."	/sport/rugby-union/64106202
business	House prices drop for the first time this year, says Rightmove	"Asking prices for homes have dropped for the first time this year, down Â£4,795, because of a summer lull in activity, says sales portal Rightmove.
Although interest rates are rising - which would increase the cost of a mortgage - it said seasonal factors were key to the drop in prices.
king price fell by 1.3% between July and August to Â£365,173.
wo years had been ""frenzied"" in the UK housing market, said Rightmove.
Prices soared as the pandemic prompted many people to search for more space in which to live and work.
How big an impact the rising cost of living, and consistent increases in interest rates, will have on the housing market will be watched closely.
m Bannister, Rightmove's director of property science, said: ""A drop in asking prices is to be expected this month, as the market returns towards normal seasonal patterns after a frenzied two years, and many would-be home movers become distracted by the summer holidays.""
1.3% drop in August was in line with the average drop seen that month over the past 10 years, Rightmove said.
""We are still expecting price changes for the rest of the year to continue to follow the usual seasonal pattern, which means we'll end year at around 7% annual growth, even with the wider economic uncertainty,"" Mr Bannister added.
He said that data showed the rising interest rates were yet to have a significant impact on the number of people wanting to move home.
""For those looking to move who are concerned about interest rate rises, it's important that they get a mortgage in principle early on in their moving journey to understand what they could afford to borrow, and find out about the rates available to them to assess what they are able to repay each month,"" he said.
rage five-year fixed rate mortgage has now breached 4%, according to Moneyfacts.co.uk, but experts expect rates to climb further.
ggest risk to making mortgage repayments is usually the loss of a job, but anyone in that position should get help, at least in the short-term, from their lender.

In a message to Ukraine, Liverpool's mayor said the event, at the M&S Bank Arena, would ""do you proud"".
Joanne Anderson said the city ""faced strong competition from Glasgow"" but she was ""over the moon"".
""This is a massive event and the eyes of the world will be on us in May, especially those of our friends in Ukraine,"" she said.

UK has hosted Eurovision eight times in the past, most recently in Birmingham in 1998. But 2023 will be the first time the contest has been in Liverpool.
A winning country normally hosts the following year's contest, but Essex singer Sam Ryder's second-placed finish this May led the UK to be asked to step in because of the war in Ukraine.
Last year's winners Kalush Orchestra will be on stage in Liverpool next year, and said on Friday: ""Playing in the same place that The Beatles started out will be a moment we'll never forget.
""Although we are sad that next year's competition cannot take place in our homeland, we know that the people of Liverpool will be warm hosts and the organisers will be able to add a real Ukrainian flavour to Eurovision 2023 in this city.""
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Liverpool, but said she was ""gutted"" for Glasgow.
Eurovision executive supervisor Martin Osterdahl said the city was ""synonymous with music"", and that Liverpool's arena ""exceeds all the requirements needed to stage a global event of this scale"".
He added: ""We have been very impressed with the passion the city has shown in embracing the contest and their inclusive ideas for placing last year's winners, Ukraine, front and centre when thousands of fans visit next May.""
BBC said both Liverpool and Glasgow had provided ""incredibly strong bids"".
roadcaster added: ""Liverpool has a fantastic venue, a beautiful backdrop of a city with a rich history of music, and a cultural offer that puts Ukraine at the heart of next year's song contest.""
ket details for the show have not yet been released. In fact, there won't just be one show - there will be nine.
As well as the live final on Saturday 13 May, fans will be able to watch a ""jury show"" on the Friday, which the international juries base their votes on, and a ""family show"" on Saturday afternoon, which is effectively a final rehearsal.
re will be two semi-finals on the preceding Tuesday and Thursday - and jury and family shows for each.
re will also be a programme of cultural events running alongside Eurovision itself - including artist exchanges and co-production between Liverpool and its sister city Odesa.
Ukrainian fashion, street art, orchestral musicians and painted eggs are among those plans - as is a trail of 20 life-sized cut-outs of Sonia, which people will be challenged to follow around the city.
11,000-capacity arena is on a former dock on the banks of the River Mersey - next to the vibrant Albert Dock, and along from the historic ""Three Graces"" (the Liver Building, Cunard Building and Port of Liverpool Building) on the waterfront.
In short, it will look great on TV.
It's next to a convention centre and an exhibition centre, which will be handy for hosting things like the press centre and other facilities, and has a couple of hotels on site.
It's also a short walk to the city centre's other hotels and rail links, and eight miles from John Lennon Airport.
's rich musical history already attracts hundreds of thousands of music tourists every year, and the arena's past major events have included the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2008.
ue is likely to have to postpone some concerts that are already in the schedule for next April and May, though, because it will be needed for preparations for six to eight weeks ahead of the song contest.
Although there is no confirmation yet of which shows will be moved, events currently in the diary include Sir Elton John on 22 and 23 April and Andre Rieu on 12 May. Olly Murs has just announced a show there on 6 May - but that may now be rearranged too.
After the announcement, Booking.com said 99% of hotels were booked up for 13 May, with the cheapest remaining room priced at Â£639."	/news/entertainment-arts-63174493
health	Nurse strikes Wales: Pay dispute 'beginning of end for NHS'	"A striking nurse has warned it could be ""the beginning of the end for the NHS"" if pay and conditions are not reviewed. 
Another union member said they would ""continue as long as it takes"" to prompt a pay negotiation.
It comes as nurses in all but one Welsh health board are taking part in a second day of strike action over pay.
Welsh government said it needed more funding from the UK government to afford pay rises, and that nurse's pay is set by an independent review body.
Watch: On the picket line with nurses across the UK
It added it would work with the NHS, patients and partners to ensure minimal disruption. 
UK government said it was giving a ""record"" Â£18bn a year in funding to the Welsh government.
Planned care is set to be the worst hit, with appointments postponed so that urgent care can be prioritised.
Strikes are being held by members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) across the country.
All health boards in Wales, except for Aneurin Bevan, are affected by striking staff.
Kath Davies, a staff nurse on the neuroscience high care ward at University Hospital Wales and one of the picket supervisors in Cardiff, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""It feels good, a lot warmer thankfully! The rain is holding off so I think we'll have an easier day today than last week to get the message across as to why we are striking. 
""We have worried the government, and you can tell by the things they are saying and trying to vilify us because of what we are doing. And the message has got across to the public. 
""We cannot deliver the standard of care we want to deliver. Without new staff coming into the service it could be the beginning of the end of the NHS and none of us want that.""
Ms Davies added negotiations ""haven't even started"". 
""We want people around the table, to negotiate the pay rise that's agreeable to everybody and unfortunately there's no dialogue at the moment,"" she said.
Addressing concerns over patient care while nurses strike, she added: ""Nobody has been left on their own today, all wards have got adequate staffing and have often got more staff on today than they have had yesterday or tomorrow or a week ago, because more effort has been made.
""We're not taking people off the wards, we're taking people away from clinics. Nobody is going to come to any harm by not having an outpatient appointment today, one day here or there is not going to make any significant difference to anybody.""
She continued: ""I know exactly what patients are feeling like, because I am one, and I know what relatives of patients will be feeling, because I am one. 
""The harm is being caused every other day because there simply aren't enough staff to do what is needed, and that's what we are standing up for.
Meanwhile in Bangor, Gwynedd, Sue Williams, RCN representative for north Wales, said the public support for strikers on her picket line has been excellent.
""I hope that we are going to make progress. We've not just come out because of pay only, we've come out because there's no staffing and because of patients safety,"" she said.
""We haven't had a decent pay rise so what you have is a knock-on effect. People are leaving, people are not coming, we're not recruiting and we're not retaining nurses. It's a profession, it's a degree level, so we should be recognised for the work that we do."" 
She said the Welsh government's claim it would need more funding from the UK government to start a pay discussion was ""not good enough"". 
Discussing possible future strike action, Ms Williams added: ""I am going to stay here as long as I have to. Not one of us nurses wants to be on strike, but we have no choice. 
""We will continue as long as it takes.""
On the picket line outside the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, staff nurse Neil Evans, 51, described the dispute as a ""fight for the future of nursing"".
""We are losing nurses,"" he said.
""They're going to the private sector where the rewards are better and you can't blame somebody for that.
""We are working short-staffed every day. We need more nurses and the only way you're going to get that is to reward them for the responsibilities we have.""
He said taking an industrial action was a ""last resort"", but he and his colleagues believed it was the only way their concerns would be heard. 
""We've tried negotiation, we've tried talking, we've tried stomping our feet. They don't seem to want to listen.
""Staff are burning out. I've seen senior nurses breaking down on shift crying. They just cannot sustain this pressure.
""If we need to be, we'll be here as long as it takes."""	/news/uk-wales-64027344
sports	Rebecca Adlington: Ex-Olympic champion on body image and getting mums swimming	"Former Olympic champion swimmer Rebecca Adlington is using what she learned about dealing with negative body image after giving birth to help other mothers in the pool.
Adlington's Swim Stars programme was involved in research that found that 65% of mums felt judged in bathing suitsexternal-link when taking children swimming.
""The hardest thing can be putting a swimming costume on after giving birth,"" Adlington said.
""I know because I've had two children.""
Adlington, a four-time Olympic medallist who retired as a competitive swimmer in 2013, has previously spoken openly about feeling insecure about how she looked as an athlete.
As a parent, she sees similar concerns as a major issue when trying to teach children the life skill of swimming.
""Most of the parents you speak to, the number one reason that holds them back from taking their children swimming is body confidence and body issues because it is the more daunting thing,"" Adlington told BBC East Midlands Today.
""Even now, my little one is 18 months old and I still don't like putting a costume on. So it doesn't just disappear after a couple of months of giving birth.
""It's these things that hold people back from bringing their children swimming, whereas actually if you bring your child swimming it helps you gain confidence but also your child as well.""
Find out how to get into swimming with our special guide.
33-year-old has focused her attention in recent years on encouraging more children to take up the sport that elevated her to international stardom as a two-time Olympic gold medallist and world, European and Commonwealth Games champion.
She has opened a number of swim centres across England in recent years, including one in her hometown Mansfield last year.
""What I wanted to create was a safe environment purpose built for children,"" Adlington said.
""Swimming can be that connection, that bonding time with your child as well.""
Recent research found the swimming is the best activity for ""creating special bonding moments"" between pre-school aged children and their parents.
Swim England researchexternal-link also found that swimming helped four in five mums ""alleviate the guilt they feel about being a busy parent"".
""It's nice before they are three that you get that time to bond with them but also get them used to the water,"" Adlington said.
""Three is also the age where you have lessons where you are not in the water with your children.
""I had a real big fear when Summer was going to lessons without me, thinking 'she is not going to like it', but she jumped straight in.
""It was me who was more scared than her. It's those lessons she did with me before that which gave her that confidence to just get stuck straight in. It made it much easier for me as a parent as well."""	/sport/swimming/63858372
entertainment	H&M: Justin Bieber collection axed after singer's 'trash' criticism	"H&M has removed a Justin Bieber-inspired collection after it was branded ""trash"" by the singer.
28-year-old said he had not approved the collection, which included T-shirts, jumpers, tote bags and phone accessories.
Posting on his Instagram Story, the Sorry singer urged people not to buy the items which he said were being sold without his permission or approval.
mpany said proper procedures were followed but have now pulled the line.
""The H&M Merch they made out of me is trash and I didn't approve it,"" Justin wrote on his Instagram story on Tuesday. ""Don't buy it. 
""I didn't approve any of the merch collection that they put up at H&M,"" he continued. 
""All without my permission and approval. I wouldn't buy it if I were you.""
In a statement, H&M defended the fashion line, which reportedly features images of the star.
""As with all other licensed products and partnerships, H&M followed proper approval procedures,"" a spokesperson for the fashion retailer said.
""But out of respect for the collaboration and Justin Bieber we have removed the garments from our stores and online.""
It's not the first time a star has hit out at a brand for using their image without permission.
In 2015, Rihanna won a court case against Topshop - she successfully sued its parent company for Â£3.3m after it sold a sleeveless T-shirt with her photo on it. 
And in 2019, Ariana Grande brought action against Forever 21 after she claimed it published at least 30 ""unauthorised"" images and videos that suggested she had endorsed the brand.
Justin is currently on a break from touring after he revealed he was suffering from facial paralysis, after a diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
Ramsay Hunt syndrome is when a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near someone's ears, resulting in paralysis of parts of the face.

health	Ipswich Half Marathon runners thanked for saving man's life	"family of a man who had a cardiac arrest during a half marathon has thanked those who helped save his life.
John Thurkettle, 60, was taking part in the Ipswich Half Marathon on 23 October when he collapsed.
Runners Kevin Ward, Ben Solway and David Smith came to his aid and carried out cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until emergency services arrived. 
Mr Thurkettle's son James said: ""I have no doubt in mind that they kept him alive.""
29-year-old said tackling the 13.1-mile (21km) distance was ""nothing out of the ordinary"" for his builder dad who had run many half marathons over the years.
However, as James, his mum Denise and one of his sisters waited for John to cross the finish line at Ipswich Town's Portman Road stadium, little did they know he had collapsed at mile 11 until they received a phone call.
""For us it was devastating,"" said James.
""We were under the assumption he would be coming around the corner at any moment; it caught us completely off-guard; we went into panic mode.""
Mr Ward, who is first aid trained, said he, off-duty GP Mr Solway, and Mr Smith, a physio, administered CPR as soon as they realised John had stopped breathing and his pulse had stopped.
He said John started breathing and they felt a pulse as the paramedics arrived and after further treatment and monitoring from the emergency services, he was taken to Ipswich Hospital.
""Dad couldn't have been more lucky in terms of the people he was surrounded by,"" James said.
""He was blessed enough to be surrounded by people who had the knowledge of what to do and were willing to do it.""
James said his father had had a seizure which led to a heart attack and he went into cardiac arrest - which occurs when the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, leading someone to stop breathing.
Father-of-four John spent two or three weeks in hospital where he was diagnosed with an underlying heart condition, but he was now ""up and about"" at home and awaiting further treatment.
James said the story highlighted how ""vital"" it was for people to be trained in CPR.
Mr Ward, from Kesgrave, said he was ""desperately keen"" to get as many people as possible to have the training.
""And to highlight the idea that actually having a go is always better than doing nothing, when it's likely the only outcome for someone who doesn't get help is death,"" he added.
gether with clubmates, Mr Ward is organising CPR training for his running club - Kesgrave Kruisers.

technology	The flying car that could turn into a biplane	"At a launch event at Draper University in San Mateo, California, a start-up revealed how its flying car hopes to take off.
Alef bills its still-in-development electric vehicle, the Model A, as the first true flying car - a vehicle that it hopes will look like a sleek electric car but be capable of vertical take-off, and able to fly for 110km (68 miles).
firm hopes to compete in a market occupied by well-advanced rivals, such as AirCar and the Pal-V gyrocopter that are already flying and driving.
But Jim Dukhovny, Alef's chief executive and co-founder, argues most existing vehicles are not strictly flying cars in his opinion.
""A flying car has to be a car, which means it can drive on a regular street, park in a regular parking space. And it also should have vertical take-off,"" he told the BBC.
""If you require an airport to take-off, what problem are you solving? And why is this a flying car?""
urface of the Model A's car-like exterior is a mesh so that air can pass through to eight propellers inside the body which provide lift.
But flying any distance using these alone, without the assistance of wings, would require prohibitive amounts of power.
Alef's proposed solution is novel - for longer flights the Model A transforms into a biplane.
After a vertical lift-off, the Model A will turn onto its side, the two-person cockpit swivels so the driver remains facing forward, and the car becomes a biplane with the long sides of the vehicle forming the top and bottom wings.
, with two wings, one on top of the other, is easier to see in the Model A if you imagine the mesh in-between the solid sides being removed. Alef has also produced a video visualising the transition.
Forbes observed that the way it would fly resembles the Opener Blackfly, an existing vertical take-off electric aircraft. 
It's an ingenious idea, but is it a practical one?
Bringing flying and driving together adds weight, electric power also means heavy batteries. 
""The design is right on the ragged edge of what the physics and technology can do, which is where you would expect it to be,"" says aeronautical engineer Professor Steve Wright of the University of the West of England.
mesh, as visualised, might also cause significant aerodynamic drag, he adds.
Alef says it has managed the transition to biplane in ""scaled flights"" since 2018. And it has large prototypes capable of vertical flight - though they don't yet resemble the polished appearance of the firm's mock-ups and concepts.
But Prof Wright warns the jump from a prototype to a working product is easily underestimated.
urdles are only one obstacle to building highways in the sky busy with flying cars.
regulation and certification of flying cars is likely to be rigorous, time-consuming and expensive, as it is for any aircraft.
fly a biplane, even one that you can drive on the roads, will require a pilots licence - though Mr Dukhovny envisions that for short low-level hops over obstacles using vertical flight, a licence used for drone operators might suffice.
And authorities are likely to impose strict rules on where vehicles can be flown.
For these and other reasons, Prof Wright thinks the future of flying cars will not be a single vehicle that consumers own, drive and fly.
In the film Back to the Future, the character Doc Brown's fusion-powered DeLorean car leaves the road and swoops into the air.
""That isn't how mass airborne transport is going to play out, which is a real shame. I really want my flying DeLorean as much as anybody does,"" Prof Wright says.
In reality, travelling by flying car, Prof Wright argues, would be more like hiring a taxi.
""You pull out your phone, and a robot car would draw up and it would take you to somewhere the size of a small park and the drone comes down, sets itself down, you jump in there. So in other words, you summon a drone taxi.""
Many companies are developing autonomous passenger drones. Recently Chinese firm Xpeng gave its first public demonstration of its X2 vehicle in Dubai. 
But Mr Dukhovny strongly believes that the idea of being able to drive and fly in the same vehicle is an attractive one. When I ask him who will pay the Model A's initial $300,000 (Â£266,000) price tag, he says ""early adopters"". 
He says people have been waiting for a flying car for a 100 years. Alef's ambitious goal is to start selling vehicles in 2025. "	/news/technology-63325341
health	Ambulance: Mum 'on edge' after boy's wait for urgent help	"mother of a four-year-old boy has said her family is ""on edge"" after an ambulance took more than 25 minutes to arrive when he had a seizure.
Oscar's mother Elizabeth told BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show that she could not stop panicking as she waited.
Her husband was asked by the 999 call handler to get a defibrillator while they waited for paramedics to arrive.
Ambulance Service has apologised and said the response time did not meet its target for the most urgent calls.
family told their story after the Ambulance Service said it was dealing with the ""highest level of pressure"" it had ever experienced.
Elizabeth said she was fearful that an ambulance would not show up in time if her son had another seizure.
She said that during the incident at their home in County Down last month Oscar initially appeared unresponsive but then started to have a seizure.
""Every minute [waiting for the ambulance] felt almost like 10 minutes,"" she said.
""I thought there was no way back from this for the length of time we waited for someone to come and [I was] just panicking the whole time.""
Ambulance Service said paramedics arrived 26 minutes after it received the call.
It said the initial information it received about Oscar's condition resulted in the call being deemed ""category two"", meaning the target response time was 18 minutes.
But the call was upgraded to ""category one"", meaning it had greater priority.
Ambulance Service said the target response time for ""category one"" calls was eight minutes.
Oscar's condition has since stabilised and he has not had a seizure since that incident but is waiting to see a consultant.
Speaking on Wednesday, the service's assistant director Mark Cochrane said that patients were being put at risk due to the level of demand within the health service in Northern Ireland.
""We have had patients who have waited many hours in excess of the performance targets,"" he said.
One problem is that some ambulance crews cannot transfer their patients to emergency departments immediately on arrival because hospitals are so busy.
refore the patients have to wait in the ambulances while they are parked outside hospitals until an appropriate space becomes available for them inside the building.
knock-on effect is that fewer ambulances are available to deal with urgent calls.
Dr Sean McGovern, an emergency medicine consultant at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, said ""avoidable harm"" was happening.
Emergency departments were in a ""very tragic, very heart-breaking situation"", he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.
He said that in 30 years of working in emergency medicine he had never seen the situation as bad as it was now.
Former Health and Social Care Board chief executive John Compton said the health service was in ""difficult times"".
He argued that the lack of major change and modernisation within the service and the lack of political leadership at Stormont had exacerbated the problems."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64064270
business	Budget pasta prices jump 50% as food staples rise	"rices of some budget food items have risen by more than 15%, according to new data, with pasta showing the steepest jump over a year.
west cost version of pasta rose by 50% in the year to April, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Household staples such as minced beef, bread and rice also recorded large increases.
But the average price rise of 30 budget food items at supermarkets was 6.7% - below the rate of inflation.
f living, or rate of inflation, rose by 9% in April, said the ONS. 
Despite sharp increases in the price of some items such as pasta, the ONS analysis found that the cost of its basket of low-cost groceries increased at a similar rate to the general basket of groceries used for the official measure of food and drink inflation. 
Earlier this year, anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe criticised large supermarkets for ""stealthily"" removing value food ranges from their shelves, forcing shoppers to ""level up"" to higher priced goods. 
She criticised the way that the rate of inflation was calculated - which measures the prices of 700 goods - stating that it ""grossly"" underestimates ""the true cost of living crisis"". 
In this latest data, the ONS measured the price of 30 everyday grocery items across seven supermarkets between April 2021 and 2022. 
It showed that the price of crisps rose by 17%, bread and minced beef grew by 16% and rice prices rose by 15%. 
Some everyday items showed a drop in prices, led by potatoes which were down by 14%. Cheese, pizza, chips, sausages and the price of apples were also lower.
Measured by price rather than percentage change, minced beef showed the biggest rise, up 32p for 500g to Â£2.34. It was followed by chicken breast which rose by 28p to Â£3.50 for 600g. 
rice of chicken - the UK's most popular meat - has risen sharply due to a number of factors. According to an analysis by the BBC, higher feed costs and soaring transport prices have contributed to the increase.  
Ms Monroe told the BBC: ""The figures that are out today will not come as news to anyone who is actually living this because we have all seen the prices of food go up.""
She said that having price rises that reflect reality for millions of people shown in official data ""puts us in a stronger position to campaign for things like better wages [and] a higher up-rating for benefits"". 
Following her comments earlier this year, Asda pledged to stock its budget ranges in all of its supermarkets. 
""All of the others just held fast and ignored it really,"" said Ms Monroe on Monday. ""If one supermarket could implement the changes, why can't the others?"" 
In response, a Sainsbury's spokesperson told the BBC that they understand customers are facing significant pressure on their household budgets. 
""We are doing all we can to help, and as part of our plans to focus on offering the best quality food at the lowest prices, today we announced we are investing Â£500m so that customers will be able to find low prices on the everyday items they buy most often,"" the spokesperson added. 
Meanwhile, Tesco said it is ""absolutely committed"" to helping customers by keeping a ""laser focus"" on the cost of the weekly shop.
""We have significantly increased the number of value lines we offer and whether it's price matching around 650 basics to Aldi prices, promising Low Everyday Prices on 1,600 staples, or offering exclusive deals and rewards through thousands of Clubcard Prices - we're more committed than ever to providing our customers with great value,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. 
BBC has also contacted Morrison's, Lidl and Aldi for a response.
