Ghana say dem no want make foreigners enta into retail business as dem reserve dat sector for dia citizens but Nigeria say dat one dey against ecowas protocol. Since Ghana and Nigeria get dia independence, diplomatic relations between di two kontris always get gbege. Di two kontris dey always wan prove who beta pass in terms politics, economy, sports, and regional integration. Even citizens of di two kontris dey drag demselves on top who  jallof rice sweet pass- dis wan  show di kain rivalry wey don dey  between di two kontris. However, di recent way wey some jaguda pipo demolish Nigrian embassy building for Ghana and di closing of Nigerian retail shops don  cause high diplomatic tension between di two kontries. While di goment of both kontris still dey try find diplomatic solution to di mata, dis na di genesis of how Nigeria and Ghana fight -fight take start. •             Pre-colonial Era: Di first gbas gbos between Nigeria and Ghana start for 1931. •             During dis period, di number of Nigerians wey di live for Ghana reach like 20 percent of di kontri population. •             Many Nigerians dia bin di work as Cocoa  farmers, business pipo, labourers and becos Ghana economy bin good, dia business bin dey boom. •             But later during di cocoa hold-up saga for Akyem Abuakwa area, di king and di traditional council bin ask di colonial goment make dem deport Nigerians wey be trouble makers.

Even for dis era, Ghanaian pipo kontinu to mount pressure on top dia goment head to deport Nigerians wey dem refer to as alien. For August 23  1957, di  Convention Peoples' Party (CPP) government passed the Deportation Act wey give goment right to deport those wey dem consider as threat to dia kontri During dis period some Nigerians chop deportation and goment describe dem say dem be opposition party members. Deportation act of 1969: Dis period mark di major deportation of aliens or foreigners dem from Ghana. Close to 200,000 pipo from Togo, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Nigeria bin pack dia kaya waka from di kontri. Sake of dis deportation, many African kontri begin target Ghanaian pipo dem for dia kontri and begin ask dem make dem leave. Ghana must go: During di period of 1986, Nigeria presido den, Shehu Shagari ask Ghanaians make dem pack dia load and leave di kontri. Many of dem bin dey Nigeria to find beta life sef come do dem back, as e ask Ghana pipo to also leave Nigeria. Di  reason Ghana bin deport plenti pipo wey dem refer as alliens from dia kontri na to provide beta job opportunities for dia citizens.

business	CBN increase interest rates: Central bank MPR explainer	Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Monetary Policy Committee don approve new Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) of 13 per cent. CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, say na six out of eleven of di committee members vote to raise di rate. Monetary Policy Rate na rate wey Central Banks for different kontris dey use control di availability of assets wey pipo fit convert to cash. If Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) rise, all di oda rates go go up, and if e drop, all di rates go drop. Nigeria bin peg interest rate for 11.5 per cent for over two years. But now, wit di new MPR review, e don jerk up to 13 per cent to manage di rising inflation. By dis increase, CBN don give Deposit Money Banks go ahead to increase lending rates to possibly dey higher dan deposit rates. Banks dey also use am to determine fixed deposit rates and normal savings rates on accounts. Although, dis new monetary rates fit affect businesses for manufacturers and exporters wey wan collect loans, di positive side be say e go fit help slow down inflation. Interest rate na one of di key tools deployed by central banks across di world to manage di flow of money and productivity for kontris. A change in interest rate fit affect macroeconomics and other key economic indicators like consumer spending and borrowing. For Nigeria, di tool allow di CBN to effect changes in broad monetary policies wey dey designed to facilitate di goment budget policy. By hiking the interest rate to 13%, e dey expected say borrowing go become more difficult. And consumers fit get less money to spend. By implication, e mean say even inside lower demand among consumers, manufacturers of goods go dey concerned about raising prices. In effect, all of these go sha combine to reduce inflation pressure. But di hike go still also fail to stop inflation if other macroeconomic indicators go wrong. When di CBN interest rates bin dey for 11.5 per cent, banks typically charge manufacturers and oda lenders between 12 to 30 per cent on loans. With di hike in rate (13%), di charges fit high like wen water don pass garri. Earlier in the year, di Manufacturers Association of Nigeria bin tok say average rate dia members dey borrow money from banks bin dey between 20.75 per cent. E bin stand at 21.25 per cent in 2020 and 2019. In terms of job creation, a hike in interest rate fit get effect—if marginal—on di number of jobs wey dem create or lost. Unemployment Rate in Nigeria don averaged for13.55 percent from 2006 until 2020. Dat time  e climbing to an all-time high of 33.30 percent inside di fourth quarter of 2020. Even if di impact fit no dey significant in di immediate, di hike in interest rate and possible fall in productivity fit throw a number of pipo out of jobs. Normally, low interest rates fit cause di stock market to go up. Just as di market dey record depreciation wen di apex bank raise interest rates. By implication, change in central banks interest rates dey affect prices of various assets such as bonds, stocks and houses.	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/media-60378409

health	Coronavirus guidelines: Why kontris wey women dey lead dey respond well to di Covid-19 pandemic?	"From New Zealand to Germany, Taiwan or Norway, some kontris wey women dey lead dey see small number of death sake of Covid-19. And dem dey praise dia politicians for media for dia behaviour, and also for di solutions wey dem introduce as di whole world dey face dis health palava. Recently tori pipo, Forbes write say dem be ""example of true leadership."" Analysts say di pipo wey pass di Covid-19 test wit flying colours na women - even though women make up only 7% of di world head of kontris. So, wetin make am look like say women leaders dey successful pass for di fight against coronavirus pandemic. Iceland Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir don do plenty testing for her pipo. Even though di kontri population na 360,000, Iceland no dull at all: Dem do tins against Covid-19 - like dem no allow pipo gada pass 20 - wey dem do till end of January, before dem even record dia first case of di disease. As of April 20, na nine pipo don die for di kontri from Covid-19. For Taiwan wey officially be part of China, President Tsai Ing-wen immediately set up epidemic control centre and she do tins to track and control spread of infection. Taiwan also increase production of personal protective equipment like face masks. So far na only six pipo don die out of 24 million pipo. Meanwhile for New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, take one of di world toughest decisions for dis Covid-19 palava.  Instead of to slow di amount of infection or ""flatten di curve"" like oyibo go tok, of reported cases like many kontris dey try do, Ardern style na to cut off all di infection pkatapkata. Di kontri enta lockdown wen  only six pipo die - and by April 20 na total of 12 pipo die. But, apart from say all of dem get women as dia leader, dis kontris wey handle di crisis beta still get oda tins in common: All dis kontris dey developed and dem get moni, wit beta system for welfare and dem dey mostly score wella wen e come to social development. Again dem get strong healthcare system wey fit to handle emergency. So, dis na about di leaders demsef - abi na about wetin we fit tok about kontri wey get woman as leader? Di way wey dis women leaders wey dem elect for office dey do dia own politics also get hand for di mata, na so observers tok. !I no tink say women get one style of leadership wey different from men. But wen women dey leadership, e dey bring variety to decision making,"" na one Dr Geeta Rao Gupta, di executive director of 3D Programme for Girl and Women and senior fellow for UN Foundation, tok. ""E dey create beta decision, because you go get di opinion of men and women,"" she tell BBC. E dey different from di macho way and denying science wey dia male counterpart bin display, from America Presido Donald Trump to Brazil Jair Bolsonaro. Rosie Campbell, director of Global Institute for Women's Leadership for King's College London, agree say ""dem no born any man or women wit leadership style."" ""But due to how society take raise us, e dey more acceptable for women to be leader wey get human feeling and wey dey collabo. And unfortunately more men dey for category of pipo wey too dey admire dem sef and over competition dey worry dem, Campbell tok. Political leaders for Brazil, Israel and Hungary, to list few kontris don try for some kain situation, shift di blame for dia fault to outsiders - like dem go accuse foreigners for ""importing di disease"" enta dia kontri. ""Trump and Bolsonaro dey choose to form macho.  Dem no born dem to behave like dat, but na dem choose to,"" Prof campbell tok. ""Women generally no dey like dat. But dem still get exception, like Marine Le Pen [for France]."" Different kontri respond in different ways to di Covid-19, partly becos each kontri get im own social and economic mata and even resources - dis  aspects no get anytin to do wit gender. Therefore, leader wey be man but no follow for di macho group wey Prof Campbell describe also get less death for dia kontris. Di way South Korea, Moon Jae-in take handle di crisis show di basis wey im party take win landslide victory for di last parliamentary election wey happun on April 15. Also Greece Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis don chop praise sake of how im successfully manage di crisis and keep di number of death as low as - 114 as at April 20 for population of 11 million pipo. Compare am to Italy wey get 60 million pipo and don see 22,000 deaths. Greece dey survive di crisis by following di advice of sabi pipo for science and im begin social distancing before dem even record di first death. Den again, some kontris wey women dey lead dey struggle wit di virus as e dey spread far and fast. For example, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina don manage to reduce di outbreak for one of di kontris wey get di most population for world. But di worry be say di kontri no too get wetin dem need to do testing and Bangaldesh health workers say dem dey risk of catching di virus as dem no get personal protective equipments. To stop di coronavirus, leaders have to make difficult decisions, like to close dia economy for di early stage of di pandemic. But dat kain decision get short time political implications, na so Prof Campbell tok. Still some female leaders don win public opinion as dem dey tok coro-coro about di challenge wey dia kontris dey face. Germany Angela Merkel quickly agree say Covid-19 na ""very serious"" threat. Her kontri set up di largest testing, tracing and isolation plan for di whole of Europe. More dan 4,600 pipo die from Covid-19 for Germany wey get population of 83 million pipo. For Norway and Denmark, di method wey di two women Prime Ministers use set dem apart from dia bragado male counterpart. Norway leader, Erna Solberg, and her counterpart for Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, do press conferences for children, dem no allow any adult enta. New Zealand Jacinda Ardern also try calm children about how dem no go fit celebrate Easter sake of lockdown. Prof Campbell say, back in di days dem for consider dat kain tok private mata, just like case of domestic violence and childcare. So, by talking to children, political leaders show say dem understand say di pandemic dey also affect di mental health of pipo for evri age, na so she tok."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/52371622

Across Africa, goments, police and activists report increase in attacks on women and girls wey trap for lockdown with abusive partner or relative. So wetin you fit do if you find yourself in dis kain of situation? We ask experts and one survivor of domestic abuse to share dia advice. ""Wen you dey for inside abusive relationship, you go notice one pattern,"" Esther* tell me, as she tink back to di three years she spend married to man wey she tok say bin dey abuse her  regularly - physically and verbally. ""Weekends dey always worse, because everybody dey for house. Your partner get more time for dia hands and fit get bored too. So you go see say dem wan find trouble. Dem go set you up - say something wey go make you react and den hit you wen you react. ""If two days fit make pesin dey bored enough to make dem wan hit you, imagine wetin one month or so of lockdown don cause pipo. No be just boredom dis time, na stress, na fear."" Several years don pass now since Esther leave her husband. And even though, practically, e bin dey more easier to comot dan e go be today, e still take time and courage. ''I feel say I dey place wia get bars and I no fit comot because economically, emotionally, psychologically, e hard well well - and den my children dey too. Also, your mama dey happy say you don marry, so you dey reason - keep her happy. Stay.'' For women wey wan leave dia partner now during lockdown, di challenge dey even bigger. If dem try to leave, police fit challenge dem say dem break curfew and dem fit struggle to find public transport. Many kontries don set up helplines, dey offer advice and support to victims. Demand for dia services dey high. During di first week of lockdown for South Africa, police receive 2,320 reports of gender-based violence - 37% higher dan usual. For Zimbabwe, one helpline say di number of abuse cases dem document bin triple, while Nigerian gender advocate, Dorothy Njemanze, tell BBC News say she dey worried by di rise of abuse cases for her kontri: ""We fear say if e continue dis way, we fit record some deaths before di lockdown over.''

But for Ghana main safe house, di Ark Shelter, director Nana Sunnu say dem dey unable to take in new clients because of di infection risk and lack of quarantine facilities. Esther, wey survive violent marriage and dey work with fellow survivors now, say make women still call di helpline even if dem dey for kontri wia di shelters dey closed. ""Try and reach out to activists wey dey for social media, activists wey you fit trust. Call dem, dem fit still do something even for dis lockdown situation.''

And for those wey really fit no escape, Esther get some final advice. ""You no need to stop your voice to make someone else feel better, but for dis situation, if dem tok something wey pain you, just ignore dem. If dem annoy you, go read book, do something else  to take your mind away from dem. ''If you fit survive di next one or two or three months... den do whatever you need to do.

health	Coronavirus vaccine: Oxford university human trials cause immune response, show positive sign inside early trial - Wetin you need to know	"One coronavirus vaccine wey di University of Oxford develop dey show say e dey safe and dey trigger immune response. Di trials dem do with 1,077 pipo show say di injection lead to di making of antibodies and T-cells wey fit fight coronavirus. DiThe findings dey largely promising, but e dey too soon to know if dis wan dey enough to offer protection and den still dey carry out larger trials. Di UK don already order 100 million doses of di vaccine. Dem dey develop di vaccine - wey dem call ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 - fast-fast. Dem dey make am from one genetically engineered virus wey dey cause di common cold wey chimpanzees dey get. Dem don change am well-well, first so e no fit cause infections inside pipo and also to make am ""look"" more like coronavirus. Scientists do dis wan by transferring di genetic instructions for di coronavirus ""spike protein"" - di important tool wey e dey use to invade our cells - to di vaccine dem bin dey develop. Dis one mean say di vaccine resemble di coronavirus and di immune system fit learn how to attack am. Much of di focus on di coronavirus so far don be about antibodies, but dis na only one part of our immune defence. Antibodies na small proteins made by di immune system wey dey stick onto di surface of viruses. Neutralising antibodies fit disable di coronavirus. T-cells, one type of white blood cell, help co-ordinate di immune system and dey able to spot which of di body cells don dey infected and destroy dem. Nearly all effective vaccines induce both di antibody and T-cell response. Levels of T-cells peak 14 days afta vaccination and antibody levels peak afta 28 days. Di study never run for long enough to understand how long dem fit last, di study for di Lancet show. Di study show 90% of pipo develop neutralising antibodies afta one dose. Only ten pipo na im dem give two doses and all of dem produce neutralising antibodies. Yes, but side-effects dey. No dangerous side-effects dey from taking di vaccine, however, 70% of pipo on the trial develop either fever or headache. Di researchers say dis one fit dey managed with paracetamol. Di results so far dey promising, but dia main purpose na to ensure say di vaccine dey safe enough to give pipo. Di study no fit show whether di vaccine fit prevent pipo from becoming ill or even lessen dia symptoms of Covid-19. More dan 10,000 pipo go take part in di next stage of di trials for di UK. However, dem never expand di trial go oda kontries because levels of coronavirus dey low for di UK, making it hard to know if di vaccine dey effective. Large trial wey involve 30,000 pipo for di US as well as 2,000 for South Africa and 5,000 in Brazil go happun. E dey possible say coronavirus vaccine go past effectiveness test before di end of di year, however, e no go dey widely available. Dem go prioritize Health and care workers as well as pipo wey be Covid-19 high risk due to dia age or medical conditions. However, vaccination wey go dey widespread dey likely to be, di earliest, next year even if everything go as plan. Di Oxford vaccine no be di first to reach dis stage, with groups for di US and China also dey publish similar results. Di US company Moderna na di firstand e vaccine fit produce neutralising antibodies.

health	Colin Powell: Former US secretary of state die of Covid-19 complications	"Di first Black US Secretary of State Colin Powell don die. Im family wey announce am say e die at di age of 84 from Covid-19 complications. Oga Powel na former top military officer wey rise to become di first African-American secretary of state for 2001 under Republican George W Bush. One statement tok say, ""We don lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American,"" ""We wan thank di medical staff ... for dia caring treatment,"" e add. Di statement say e bin don dey fully vaccinated against Covid. Oga Powell na moderate Republican wey comot from in party to endorse Barack Obama for 2008. E become trusted military adviser to some leading US politicians. He dey wounded for Vietnam during service, experience wey later help define im own military and political strategies. E be highly decorated army officer, and despite im own doubts, e help swing international opinion behind di 2003 invasion of Iraq. Colin Powell come from a humble background to become di first African-American US secretary of state. Dem born Colin Luther Powell for Harlem, New York City, on 5 April 1937, e be di son of Jamaican immigrants. Im parents originally pronounce im name wit a short ""o"" for di traditional English way, but he change di pronunciation to honour one US Army Air Corps pilot, Colin Kelly, wey dey killed shortly afta Pearl Harbor. According to Powell, im be average scholar wey leave high school wit no positive career plans. As e dey study geology for di City College of New York, e join di Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), one programme wey dem design to identify future military leaders. Powell later describe am as one of di happiest experiences of im life. Afta graduation for 1958, e dey commissioned as second lieutenant for di US Army. He undergo basic training for Georgia, where dem refuse to serve am for bars and restaurants sake of im skin colour. For 1962,  e be one of di thousands of advisers wey President Kennedy send go South Vietnam to help di local army against threat from di communist North. For October 2015, di ex-US Secretary of State Colin Powell bin join Nigerian musician, Olu Maintain on top stage for London to dance and sing in celebration of African culture Di America former top diplomat bin take di centre stage wit Olu Maintain to gryate wit im hit song that year ""Yahoozee."" For 1987, Powell become national security adviser. Dis na di time wey US dey involved in so-called ""dirty wars"" for South America. When George H.W. Bush enta office for 1989, e appoint Powell as Chairman of di Joint Chiefs of Staff, di highest military position for di US Department of Defense. At 52, e be di youngest officer ever to hold di post, and di first from an African-American background. E face immediate crisis when di US attack Panama for December 1989, wey comot di dictator, General Noriega, one move wey dey strongly condemned by di United Nations. Di 1990 Gulf War see di implementation of one strategy wey dey dubbed as di Powell Doctrine. Essentially, Powell believe say na until all diplomatic, political or economic fail na that time US suppose resort to military force. However, once dem launch military action, then di maximum force necessary suppose dey deployed to subdue di enemy quickly while minimising US casualties. E clash wit di new president on top di issue of allowing gay pipo to join di military and Powell no gree, and e get public disagreement wit Madeleine Albright, di then US ambassador to di UN, over military intervention for Bosnia. E  comot di army for 1993 and devote im time to writing im autobiography - wey top di New York Times best-seller list - plus e engage for charity work. Since e no be military officer again, e begin chook himself inside politics. E get time wey pipo tok say e dey stand against Bill Clinton for di 1996 presidential election, but Powell decide say im lack di passion for a political career. For 2000, George W Bush appoint Powell as secretary of state, di post responsible for US relationships wit foreign countries. George W Bush dey among di first to pay tribute to ""a great public servant"" as well as ""a family man and a friend"" who ""was such a favourite of presidents wey e earn di Presidential Medal of Freedom - twice"".

health	Coronavirus: See wetin ISIS, Boko Haram and oda jihadist leaders dey tok about Covid-19	"Di reactions of Jihadist to di Covid-19 pandemic dey different between groups, altho plenti of dem agree say na divine punishment against ""pipo wey no believe in God"". Di different opinion wey dey clear pass na been between jihadist rivals  Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda. As IS dey treat di pandemic as opportunity to increase attacks, al-Qaeda dey see am as chance to preach and dem don invite non-muslims to convert to Islam. All di Jihadists dey hopeful say di pandemic go affect di capacity of di military forces wey dey fight against dem and allow dem to make gains. So far, e be like say di pandemic don get little impact on jihadist activity on ground. In fact e be like say IS don increase attacks for di past two months, with dia messages. However, dis fit change if di situation dey worse for areas where dis group dey active like Africa and Middle East. For di early 2020 wen na only for Wuhan Covid-19 bin dey, jihadists bin happy say di virus na God punishment for di ""persecution"" of Uighur Muslims for China's western Xianjiang province. IS, bin look di matter in a different way. For their first comment on di mata on 6 February, IS, through iim weekly paper al-Naba, say as Covid-19 be punishment wey God send, Muslims fit no sabi say na di  punishment of di Chinese for di ""persecution"" of Muslims, dem still remind dem say e fit affect di Muslims too. However, dem tok say reliogion allow am if pesin dey happy sake of im enemy downfall. Later dat month, IS rejoice wen di virus hit Iran. For March, as di virus spread to Europe and di US, jihadist groups happy more and more. dem call Covid-19  ""soldier of Allah"" wey dey punish di West for im ""sins"" and ""persecution"" of Muslims. On 22 March, as IS supporters mark di first anniversary of di group loss of Baghouz,  di last pesin wey be IS backbone for eastern Syria, dem tok say di spread of di virus for di West na God punishment for Muslims wey dem kill for di Syrian village. For early April, al-Shabab hailCovid-19 as punishment from God of ""infidels"", including for dia killing of jihadist leaders for different conflict zones. Dem ask Muslims to celebrate di virus outbreak for di West. But by mid-March, as Muslims begin catch di virus all around, jihadist begin change dia message. Many of dem begin tok say Covid-19, wey dem bin tok say na ""soldier"" of God, na wake up call to humanity, including Muslims, to ""return to God"". Al-Qaeda, for example, for im first official comment on di pandemic on 31 March, tell Muslims say di spread of  di virus among dem na di sake of say dem no too follow Islam and im teachings well. ""Truth be told, di arrival of dis virus to Muslim kontris na sake of our own actions. Na our fault because we don move away from di path of God "", dem tok am as dem ask Muslims to repent. For im second comment on di virus on 27 April, Somali group al-Shabab stress im position say di virus na revenge of God against pipo wey be ""infidels"", but dis time dem add ""sinful"" Muslims to di mix. Dem warn say God dey punish Muslims for ""di evil wey dey spread among them"". Dis na also Boko Haram position on 15 April. As di group leader Abu Bakr Shekau celebrate di spread of di virus for di West, he also tok say na God punishment for di sins of humanity. Shekau no support movement constraints and social distancing around di world, plus for Muslim kontris, with di freedoms wey Boko Haram militants continue to enjoy. ""You getthe virus, we get di anti-virus, wey be Allah"", im boast tok am. Even as conspiracy theories bin dey about Covid-19 say na man-made and na for one laboratory for China or di US, jihadists mostly dey believe say na God send am as a message to humans. For im weekly paper al-Naba on 26 March, IS dey yab Muslims wey dey follow ""ignorant"" theories say goment get hand to develop di virus. IS argument no be to defend di US or China, but to make sure say God alone, rather than man, dey control events of di scale of di Covid-19 pandemic. Jihadists don also criticise Western states, especially di UK and US, for di way dem no handle di crisis well. On 19 May, al-Qaeda condemn British Prime Minister Boris Johnson as im propose ""herd immunity"" strategy. For one video message, one al-Qaeda narrator say: ""Dis theory na cosmetic makeover of Darwinist theories wey don dey di Western psyche: extermination of di weak and survival of di fittest."" Jordan-based jihadist cleric Abu Qatada al-Filistini, wey dem deport from di UK in 2013,tok di same thing for March. He stok say di UK response to Covid-19, dem design am to remove old pipo for di kontri to reduce financial pressures for di economy. Dis arguments follow wetin jihadist dey tok about Western capitalist system say e dey materialistic and e dey carry di economy and financial strength over human life and dignity. So far, di most direct call to use di Covid-19 pandemic in order to increase jihadist attacks globally don come from IS. For di editorial of al-Naba on 19 March, di jihadist group tell im followers say Western armies and security forces don dey ""stretched to di maximum"" for di support of their goment' efforts to stop di spread of di virus. Sake of dis, their capacity to constrain in their ability to fight jihadists abroad sake of di fear of infection, e add am. Data on attacks wey IS don claim worldwide don show upward trend for April and May over di first three months of di year. Dis conditions, IS tok say e dey, present golden opportunity for jihadists to strike even harder and ""show no mercy"". ""Di last thing dey [Western goments] need na new caliphate attacks wey be like di one for Paris, London and Brussels"", IS tok, as dem dey reference past attacks. Dem also tok say di rescue of ""Muslim"" prisoners while goments dey ""distracted"" suppose be priority. Dis na likely reference wey dem IS-linked prisoners and families wey dem hold for east Syria prisons and detention camps, among other jihadists wey dem detain for oda places. Di group also dey hopeful say di impact of di pandemic on goment' economies ""go need take big effect on how to weaken their ability to fight di mujahidin for di coming phase"". One week earlier, on 12 March, many international media outlets interpret IS general health guidance to Muslims to stay away from di epicentres of any virus outbreak to mean say na directive to its militants to avoid travelling to Europe. But dis no be wetin IS really tok, and a directive to members di following week confam di opposite; as dem tell followers to carry out attacks for Europe and elsewhere. (See: Explainer: Did IS ban members from going to Europe over coronavirus?) Shortly after IS call for attacks during Covid-19, pro-IS media groups produce posters wey dey call for attacks for di West. Images show landmarks for di UK and US with calls to ""Hit dem wen dey least expect it"" and di hashtag ""coronavirus"". In di same vein, on 25 March, di jihadist magazine Voice of India, wey dem link to di pro-IS Kashmir Jundul Khilafah, ask jihadists to use di pandemic as opportunity to strike for India and elsewhere. ""Allah don make dis disease a source of chaos among di nations of disbelief, and dem don deploy their militaries and police for their streets and alleys, E go make dem easy target... Use dis opportunity to strike dem"", di English-language publication tok. Al-Qaeda's soft message to Western nations during di global pandemic dey different from dat of im rival, IS. On 31 March al-Qaeda release im first official comment on di health crisis for one detailed five-page statement. Under di subhead, ""One general invitation to Western nations to enter Islam"", al-Qaeda ask dem to consider di moral and divine lessons of di coronavirus and how it don make strong economies, armies and goment dey ""helpless"". For one message to non-Muslims in general and Western nations especially, al-Qaeda tok say: ""We go like to express our strong desire for you [non-Muslims] to become our partners for heaven... Just as we share life on dis earth. na our desire and wish that we go all share eternal life for heaven. Therefore, we go invite you to get to know Islam and convert to am"". Inside di meassage, e tell dem to take advantage of di lockdown to read and learn about Islam ""through ogbonge sources wey dem fit trust"". Al-Qaeda promot Islam as a religion wey dey encourage cleanliness and personal hygiene, including through regular ablution to perform prayers and quote Prophet Muhammad say im dey encourage strict quarantine measures at times of virus outbreaks. Despite im conciliatory message to Western nations, al-Qaeda dey happy at di ""helplessness"" of Western goments, especially di US, to contain di pandemic and deal with di result di pandemic dey get on their economies. Al-Qaeda tok say di ""injustice"" and ""tyranny"" of Western governments get link to ""God's wrath"" wey don send coronavirus to dem. Di difference responses from al-Qaeda and IS to di pandemic dey represent di approach of individuals for di group and media strategies. While al-Qaeda dey use 'hearts-and-minds' policy to win over ordinary Muslims and sometimes Western nations IS dey use blunt, confrontational and uncompromising approach. Al-Qaeda's strategy, still never stop am to dey threaten and incite against both di US and im Western allies. Some jihadist groups or individuals don consider Covid-19 to offer temporary relief for jihadists, according to them, dem use di impact e get on reducing military operations against them as example. IS, for example, don report di impact of Covid-19 on di deployment of Western armies for di Middle East, especially Iraq, and for Africa Sahel. In April and May, IS attacks for Iraq increase. E no dey clear if dis na result of how di goment dey busy with Covid-19 measures or di ongoing political kasala for di kontri, plus how US comot operations against IS for Iraq. For early March, Syria-focused jihadist magazine  say di global pandemic don ""slow down"" di war for northern Syria in favour of rebel and jihadist groups as e change di priorities of tdi Syrian goment and Russia wey don dey close to capturing Idlib Province. For April, Al-Qaeda's Sahel branch Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) bin happy say di ""Godsent"" don get impact on foreign troops wey dey fight jihadists for di African region. JNIM claim say di spread of di virus for France and Spain - both members of an anti-jihadist coalition for di Sahel - and purported infections among ""invader forces"" in Mali, dey make foreign troops to reduce or suspend operations for di region. Also for April, senior al-Shabab preacher, Fuad Shongole, tok am for one audio message say di pandemic dey work in favour of jihadists. Shongole, wey get bounty on im head, tok: ""dey [US] deny us movement and put five million on our heads. You don see plane dey fly nowadays?"", im dey suggest say dei number of  US aircraft wey dey target jihadists don reduce. You go hear di congregation dey shout ""God is Great"". Most hardline jihadist groups wey don  talk about their own militants taking precautions to avoid infections, and dem no show say di virus get any effect on their gatherings or operations. IS, for example, for May release some photo wey no too dey clear of im militants dey enjoy Ramadan food and dem dey pray together without any signs of social distancing. For April, Boko Haram leader Shekau compare di position of im fighters with all di Muslims around di world wey dey face restrictions like di suspension of di Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca, di closure of mosques or bans on Friday prayers. ""We dey fine, fine, fine"", he tok. ""We still dey able to pray five times everyday, we still dey fast, we dey flog pipo wey commit adultery and we still dey cut di hands of pipo wey tiff as punishment"", he add am. But jihadist groups, including IS and al-Shabab, don issue guidance to Muslims dey tell them to observe health and safety measures suitable for virus outbreaks. Most of the things dem recommend na from religious books and health advice from early Islam. Jihadists in general don criticise di moves to close mosques or stop communal prayers. Dem don argue say make Muslims take precautions, plus make dem wear masks and stay away if dem no well, but dem tok say make mosques no close their doors. Sake of active measures to take tackle di virus, some groups don prepare pass di others. Dis na especially di case for groups wey don hold territory. On 13 May, al-Shabab announce say dem form one seven-member committee to monitor Covid-19 cases for areas under im control and to provide guidance on future developments. Dem tok say di pipo wey dey di committee na doctors, religious scholars and sabi pipo. Di Syria-based opposition body, di Salvation Goment, wey dey run most of Idlib Province for di north, don dey very active as e dey try to prove say im be one de facto government. Na jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) dey support di administrative body and na dem dey control di large parts of Idlib. Di Salvation Goment don dey promote im measures to curb di spread of di virus for Idlib. Part of im measures na to suspend Friday prayers and close open markets, remove public benches, sanitise prisons conducting tests, dem dey produce affordable face masks and dem also train female volunteers wey get medical background. On 12 May, dem announce say dey set up  ""crisis cell"" to deal with di pandemic. Meanwhile, di Afghan Taliban don comment on the ""dire"" conditions and di too much crowd wey dey for Afghan prisons, dem warn say dis fit dey ""catastrophic"" for di context of Covid-19. Dem don criticise Afghan and US authorities as well as human rights organisations say dem no gree address di mata. Overall, jihadists don cautiously welcome dis period of Covid-19, dem dey see am mostly as a problem for dia enemies. Gloating don be part of di key sentiments wey jihadists don express towards di West. Jihadists no too show concern about di conspiracies say di development and spread of di virus in labs, and largely believe na God punish ""infidels"" and, later, to help jihadists. As IS bin vocal about using di pandemic to step up attacks, other jihadist groups dem don make as dem see opportunity in di pandemic. Dem dey hopeful say e go reduce military pressure on dem as e go distract goments and armies. Di pandemic so far never get any notable impact on di activities of di militant, as we report am on 17 April."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-52782460

No be say any type of handover don near. Sign no dey say di 77-year old head of state wan comot seat of power, now wey dem just elect am for fresh term for March, and done rule for many decades. Yet if Denis-Christel come enta power after im papa comot, dis one go confam di format wey don dey dey popular for Central Africa. For neighbouring Gabon President Ali Bongo Ondimba na di son of Omar Bongo, wey rule from 1967 to 2009, while for Democratic Republic of Congo Joseph Kabila rule for 17 years after im takeover for 2001 when dem assassinate im papa Laurent-Désiré as head of state. Equatorial Guinea President Teodoro Obiang - wey comot im own uncle Francisco Macías Nguema as di kontri first head of state, for 1979 - don already appoint im son, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, as vice-president, to make am easy for am to takeover. And after Chad President Idriss Déby die last month - from wetin goment say na injury from war front - im son Mahamat, wey be four-star army general, don sharpaly rise to be di leader of di interim ruling military council. And now underground tok-tok don dey dey say Cameroon sef fit see dis kain family format. Dis na afta one anonymous ""citizens' movement"" campaign begin for Franck Biya, di son of di 88-year-old President Paul Biya wey never even reach middle of im new seven-year term.

But also, im never tell dem to stop, and e never comot public statement say im no get am for mind to succeed im papa. Of course, political dynasties no be new tin - see for example di Bush and Kennedy family for di US. And currently for Uganda, one social media campaign dey package General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, son of current head of state Yoweri Museveni, as di potential ruling party candidate for di next election in 2026. But dis pattern of leaders wey dey hand power to dia pikin dey common pass for west-central Africa economies wey depend on oil, as di money from oil dey ginger di politics dia. E dey also cause rivalries and and katakata inside di ruling dynasties. Rumours dey say inside di Obiang family fight-fight don dey happen, as tori be say some family members dey favour anoda son of di president, Oil Minister Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima. But di phenomenon dey particularly entrenched in west-central Africa's petro-economies, wia oil revenues often lubricate di networks of political patronage and empire-building. It dey also fuel rivalries and resentments within ruling dynasties and dia often complex webs of personal connection. Rumours of palace intrigue dey among di Obiangs, wit some family members said to dey favour alternative presidential son, Oil Minister Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima. But no be just about personal issues. Ali Bongo face former foreign minister and African Union Commission chief Jean Ping, inside di 2016 Gabonese election. Meanwhile Ping na di former partner to di president sister Pascaline, wey go make president Ali Bongo uncle to dia two children. Five years after di elections, Ping no gree for di defeat as serious kwesions comot about whether di polls dey free and fair. French justice don dey torchlight Equatorial Guinea regime for allegations say dem bring enter France family assets wey dem use corruption money buy. Di Bongo and di Nguesso na im French authorities dey targe: di 13 pipo wey dem open formal investigation ontop dia head also include one lawyer wey work for di President Omar. For 2015 French judges order say make dem seize two properties for Paris wey dem believe di real own na Sassou-Nguesso nephew Wilfrid Nguesso; not to mention 15 luxury cars dem seize join. Wilfrid dey under formal investigation. Then by middle of 2017 - one year after Nguesso say make France troway di case against am -  French authorities put di president daughter Julienne and her husband Guy Johnson, anoda nephew, Edgar, and one former sister-in-law, Catherine Ignanga, under formal investigation. Di matter relate to $22.4m of money transfer dem allege say dey suspicious, wey happen between 2008-2009. But na Equatorial Guinean Vice-President, Teodoro, attract attention pass, with police wey don raid im luxury house since like 2012 and seize plenty cars, including two Bugatti Veyrons  and one Rolls Royce Phantom. Dem later sentence Teodoro order am to pay €30m fine. Im goment International Court of Justice, wia dem argue say di  Avenue Foch mansion, wey worth €107m, na dia embassy for France and so e get diplomatic immunity. But, last December the Court reject di argument. Even though for some countries di recent trend na for presidents to want put dia family members for power after dem don comot, e no dey clear whether dis pattern fit last. Dis na because African population dey young more and more and dia expections of dia goments don dey change.

sports	Chelsea vs Man City: Premier League predictions for dis weekend & match kick-off times	"Chelsea against defending Premier League champions Manchester City for Stamford Bridge na one of di big games dis weekend. Di Blues dey unbeaten dis season afta five games and dey siddon ontop di league wit 13 points. While City don lose one match dis season and siddon for number five position. BBC football sabi pesin Mark Lawrenson don drop im predictions for dis weekend games wit im guest wey be legendary drum and bass DJ and producer Friction, Wey im new single I Need To Feel don come out. Friction na Arsenal season ticket holder wey bin fall in love wit di club wen im go Highbury at di age of 10, and enjoy to dey watch legends like Ian Wright, Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry. E don dey follow di club for more dan three decades. ""I bin grow up to watch some amazing players and I bin enjoy some very special times, but for di last few years e dey very frustrating to be an Arsenal fan,"" e tell BBC Sport. Games go kick off by 3pm West African time except dem tok odawise. Di last time Manchester City bin go Stamford Bridge, na for January, dat game dem bin score Chelsea three goals inside 35 minutes, but dat na before Thomas Tuchel bin take ova and dis na very different Chelsea side now. Games between di big four - these two, plus Liverpool and Manchester United - go dey very important dis season. E dey obvious say dem go gap di rest, but in what order? These matches, and dia mini-league, go decide am. Chelsea dey hot form now and e show for di way dem finish Spurs for second half on Sunday but I tink say dis go be open game, because both managers no go wan lose. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Friction prediction: I go prefer City to win it, from di London point of view, but dis go be tough game. City dey capable of playing di most amazing football, but Chelsea just dey strong dey go. 1-1 Manchester United still dey try to find dia balance. Dem go win plenty games dis season, but sometimes e go choke dem. Di big question for me na if United fit win without playing well? I know say dem bin win for West Ham last week, but na narrow escape because of di penalty save for di end. Den dem change dia whole team and lose to di same opposition for di Carabao Cup in midweek, but na wetin di Hammers do too. Aston Villa bin beat Everton comfortably last time out and, before dat, dem bin play well against Chelsea and show say dem fit make life difficult for di top sides. United suppose win dis one, but e no go dey straightforward. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Friction prediction: Villa sign some good players during di summer but I feel say Bruno Fernandes go dey form for United, and Cristiano Ronaldo go enjoy imself too. 2-1 Everton bin fall yakata in di space of about 10 minutes for Aston Villa but dia problems no reach Norwich own. Di Canaries don lose all five of dia games so far and chop beating for dia house last weekend wen dem bin play Watford. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Friction prediction: Everton bin get bad week but dem go win dis one. 1-0. Leeds neva win game yet dis season, and dem look like a different team from wetin dem be last season. Dem don concede plenty of goals, though - 12 in five league games so far, and at least one in every match. Even wit dia poor form, I still tink say Marcelo Bielsa side go come good soon rather dan later. West Ham only league defeat bin come against Manchester United for strange circumstances, but I fancy Leeds to win dis one. Lawro prediction: 2-1 Friction prediction: Goals go dey dis game. 2-3 Leicester fit argue say dem no get luck for each of dia three league defeats so far, but dem gatz comot dat one for dia mind. Dis na tough game, even wit di slow start for Burnley. Di Foxes come from a goal down to beat dem in di Clarets past two visits to King Power Stadium, and dem go need to work hard to get dia season back on track. Lawro prediction: 2-1 Friction prediction: Leicester go win dis one. 2-0 Watford results dey up and down so far but dem get six points from dia first five games dem go dey satisfy wit am. Meanwhile Newcastle na one of five top-flight teams without a win and dia performances no dey too. I neva see anything wey go suggest say dem dey about to climb up di table. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Friction prediction: Dis game go dey tight. 1-1 Dis na Liverpool  first visit to Brentford for di league since 1947 and di whole atmosphere don dey to welcome dem. Di Bees go dey lively for di pitch too - Ivan Toney dey do great job and di team sabi score, e go give dem a chance for di games - or most of di games anyway. I just feel say Liverpool go dey too strong for dem. Jurgen Klopp don begin rotate im team regularly but e no mean say e go affect di results - e dey  generally get am right wen im drop pipo. Lawro prediction: 0-2 Friction prediction: Liverpool dey resemble dia old selves but I no tink say e go dey easy for dem. 0-1 I bin dey impressed by Southampton for dia draw for Manchester City last week. Dem neva win yet, but dem no be team wey look like dem dey any kind of trouble. Dat na why I dey support Saints to get dia first victory here. Wolves don lose four of dia first five league games and, although I no tink say dem go struggle for long, dem no dey strong as dem bin dey. Lawro prediction: 2-1 Friction prediction: I feel say dis game na di hardest out of di 10 to predict. I bin dey tempted to go for a 0-0 but Saints fit win am. Dem bin look good against Manchester City last week. 1-0 Tottenham bin win dia first three league games of di season, while Arsenal bin lose all dia games, but dia results don change in di past couple of weeks. I no fit say I dey surprised by dia inconsistency. I tok am from di start say I no fancy Tottenham defence, add to di fact say Harry Kane neva hit form yet for dem for di league. Arsenal don improve from di way dem bin start dis season but I no see dem dey go on a long unbeaten run now. Dem fit draw dis game. Dat na di result di two managers go wan settle for based on dia circumstances. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Friction prediction: Neither team dey great at di moment, but I feel say we dey a bit better dan dem. 1-0 Crystal Palace vS Brighton (8PM West African Time) Liverpool bin finish Crystal Palace last weekend, but odawise di Eagles dey OK so far under Patrick Vieira. Dis na Vieira first M23 derby as a player or a manager, and how im side go play go depend on Wilfried Zaha - di way im go play even if im no dey score goals imself. Wit four wins from five games, Graham Potter Brighton side dey OK. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Friction prediction: As far as dis game dey concern, e go hot. 1-1"	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/sport-58674414

sports	EPL fixtures, predictions and kick-off time	Last week BBC football expert Chris Sutton bin predict right wen e say Liverpool go lose to Arsenal. But how im feel say di Reds go perform against Manchester City on Sunday. Sutton dey predict scores for evri game dis season wit different-different guest. For dis weekend fixtures, im dey up against one musician wey im name be Ian Broudie of di Lightning Seeds. Broudie na lifelong Liverpool fan, im prediction for Sunday game dey very different to Sutton. Before we reach Sunday fixtures make we start wit Friday & Saturday matches Afta dia good start to di season, Brentford form don drop badly. Last week Newcastle beat dem. E dey hard to know exactly wetin to expect from Brighton afta Roberto di Zerbi take charge, but dem bin dangerous team - and I feel say dem go win dis one. Sutton prediction: 1-2 Ian prediction: Di Zerbi don do well so far but I don see dis kain tin before where team form go just drop, e fit be say di players stop to do wetin di new manager wants them to do. For dat reason I dey go for Brentford. 2-1 Leicester last home game na against Nottingham Forest, dem play well for dat game, but dem come go backwards against Bournemouth last week. I know feel say tins don change - di Foxes defence still dey weak, Crystal Palace, and Wilfried Zaha, go capitalise on dat. Palace form too, bin get as e be until dem beat Leeds last time out. I feel say dem go cause Leicester problems, but di Foxes too fit hurt dem. Based on dat, I dey for a draw. Sutton prediction: 2-2 Ian prediction: Moral low well-well for dat Leicester team. 1-3 Fulham bin play well for di first half against West Ham but end up wit nothing to show for am. I always no dey send Bournemouth, and dem dey always prove me wrong. I know dia fans love am too... so you know wia I dey go wit dis. Di Cherries don do well unda Gary O'Neil, but I feel say Fulham go dey gingered for dis game, and dem go come wit point to prove. Sutton prediction: 2-1 Ian prediction: 1-1 Wolves still no get manager but dem get some good players, wey no dey play anywia near di levels we know dem fit. Dem dey di bottom three but I look dem as team wey no dey fulfil dia potential. Dats no really be di case wit Nottingham Forest, wey bin dey fortunate to get sometin out of dia game wit Aston Villa on Monday. Forest new signings neva click yet and dem be team wey e be like say dey don start to dey doubt diasef small small. Sutton prediction: 2-0 Ian prediction: Wolves no dey score plenti goals but I still tink dem go win. 1-0 Everton bin no really shine against Manchester United last weekend, even afta dem take early lead. Di Toffees defence don improve wella since di last time dem show for Spurs - dem lose 5-0 for March - but United show say you still fit get am. I feel say Everton boss Frank Lampard game plan go dey different, but to stop Spurs no go dey easy. Harry Kane dey form and Son Heung-min still dey my fantasy team and im go come good soon. So, Tottenham go find dia way. But how comfortable dis game go be for dem go depend on wen dem score dia first goal. Sutton prediction: 3-1 Ian prediction: Dis one go toff but I dey go wit Spurs. 3-1 Aston Villa fans no dey feel Steven Gerrard right now. Na sake of di way dem dey play and dia results. Meanwhile Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dey score  goals and Graham Potter dey show say im dey adapt well. Villa go dey under pressure to win for home, and I feel say di pressure go affect di players. Sutton prediction: 0-2 Ian prediction: Stevie G need sometin, but e go hard. 0-1 As I bin tok earlier, Leeds bin play well for di first 45 minutes against Crystal Palace but dem bin no fit sustain am. Dis game fit follow di same pattern, as Leeds fit press early for di game, den fall apart later. Howeva e be, I dey expect Arsenal to win because dem dey hot at di moment. Sutton prediction: 1-3 Ian prediction: I dey see plenti goals for dis game. 3-4 I no think say Manchester United go win dis game. Di only question na, weda Newcastle go take three points home, or just one? No be say I no feel say Manchester United dey make progress under Erik ten Hag, bicos dem dey make progress. But I like as Newcastle dey bicos dem dey take di game to dia opposition, and di goals don start to dey flow – dem don score nine for dia past two matches. I no feel say Magpies boss Eddie Howe go change im team game for Old Trafford, because dat no be im style. Sutton prediction: 1-1 Ian prediction: 1-2 Dis na anoda another toff one. I feel like I go go for a draw for a lot of di games dis week - Liverpool versus City na one of di few wia I dey see a clear winner. Sutton prediction: 1-2 Ian prediction: 0-2 E dey hard to make case for Liverpool say dem still dey title race anyway, but if City go Anfield and win den na game ova for Jurgen Klopp's side; dem no get any chance to win di title. City know dis one, and dem know say dem fit finish dem dia. Dem rest Erling Haaland midweek so im go dey ready - and I feel say City dey dat good, dem go do di job dia. Liverpool fit still create opportunities, because of di way City dey set up, but wen you look both teams, City just too make brain. Sutton prediction: 1-4 Ian prediction: E go good if we fit get something but because of where we dey - I no feel say we dey challenge for di league. But If tins click, you no know o - Liverpool on dia day na wild card - but if dis na di final score den I am done finish for football! 9-0	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/cjkxnlr6x78o
