Di Southeast Asian kontri dey account for more dan half of world palm oil supply, don sama ban on anykind Wetin cause di export ban be say Indonesia pipo don start protest against increase for di price of cooking oil. Di price increase don disturb dia local supply. So di question now be say wia Africa wey dey import oil wela go turn to next for supply. For 2021, Africa bin spend five billion dollars to import estimate of four million metric tonnes of palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia. One tonne of palm oil be about $1,850 for di commodity exchange for Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia. E den add, anoda 150 to 200 US dollars for transport and handling costs, per tonne.

While Pakistan and Bangladesh import nearly 80% of dia palm oil from Indonesia. Connie Magomu, di General Manager, National Oil Palm Project, for Uganda say di ban sef be opportunity. Magomu see am as good chance for Africa kontries to develop dia own palm oil sector. ""E dey very efficient for land use, as e dey produce more oil per unit area dan any oda crop wey we sabi (E dey give between four to 10 times more oil per unit area)."" ""E be also one good crop for poverty reduction sake of once e reach maturity for three and half years. ""E go dey harvested every 10 days for 20 to 25 years"", She add.

Wen Ilebaye tell am to caution herself wen she bin dey raise her voice, Beauty go meet am for wia she siddon and remove her wig and cap, action wey give am her first strike for di house. O﻿da pipo wey go on to get strike for di show na Amaka, Sheggz and Bella. Beauty na di only housemate for di Big Brother Naija Level Up to get disqualified from di show. Di 2019 Miss Nigeria chop disqualification afta Biggie give am a total of three strikes. She get di second set of strikes sake of say she throw her wig and glasses at Groovy.

Wetin cause di kasala be say Beauty love interest, Groovy bin dance wit Chomzy, anoda babe for one of dia Saturday night parties and e vex di former Miss Nigeria. No season of Big Brother Naija wey no dey involve ships - na wetin fans dey call relationships for di house. Di Level Up season no dey left out. Ships no be only love relationship among housemates, e fit also be friendship and 'siblingship'. Bella and Sheggz aka Mr and Mrs Ikoyi na di most talked about ships and most consistent for di season seven show. Some pipo wey feel Sheggz no dey give Bella di respect wey she deserve bin hope say di Shella ship go sink but di two housemates no fit do witout each oda from start till wen Sheggz comot for di 9th week - a week to di finale. Even though dem dey get issues well-well, dem dey always settle dia issue as both of dem admit say dem no perfect and dem still dey get to know each oda. Beauty and Groovy ship na one of di early ships for dis year Big Brother Naija, but unfortunately di ship sink before e sail far as e all end wen Beauty dey disqualified afta she qwanta wit Groovy ontop accuse say she dance wit Chomzy. H﻿owever, afta Beauty dey disqualified, e no tey wey Groovy move on wit anoda housemate Phyna for di show. D﻿at situation cause tok-tok among fans.

Eloswag and Chomzy ship dey confuse pipo sometimes sake of say dem put each oda for friend zone but e also get time wey di housemates become close. Despite say dia relationship no dey defined, di two housemates care about each oda and Eloswag dey always stand up to defend Chomzy anytime, any day.

Some of di oda twists na di level three house biggie introduce to hide housemates wey chop eviction for some days - Doyin, Eloswag and Chomzy before e return dem to di main house and before e tell dem bye-bye. A﻿noda and perhaps di most impactful twist na di one wey give Chi-chi di power to to save two pipo and automatically level dem up to di final week  wen she win Head of House. She pick Phyna and Daniella. A﻿noda twist for di show na di introduction of fake housemates and riders. B﻿iggie bring in Deji and Modella as fake housemates wey later leave.

First, e deny am to win Nigeria ruling party APC primary wey lead to oga Obaseki to port alias defect in June to di kontri main opposition PDP to contest for di 19 September election. And oga Oshiomhole also make sure e campaign against Obaseki to deny am di chance to win im second term for office.

Di election na really between di two political leader as each of dem try to prove who get power pass. Oga Geoarge Akume wey be former govnor of di state and di APC leader of di state na im bring Smauel Ortom for power But close to di end of im first tenure dem come di kwata as oga accuse say di former govnor no allow work sake of plenti demand. E come decamp go PDP afta e discover say oga George don make up im mind to deny am di nomination. But afta di election, and di supplementary election, dem come declare am winner. For years di PDP reign supreme for Nigeria oil rich Rivers State until one man decide to test di foundations of di party for 2015 wen e decamp go di APC. Chibuike Amaechi govern Rivers State for eight years under di umbrella of di PDP, and during dat period e rise to di level of pesin wey sabi di political game even though technically na only one election im contest and win to be govnor of di Nigerian southern state. Im porting alias defection to di APC bin look like for di first time since democracy rule for Nigeria anoda party oda dan di PDP go rule Rivers State.

Amaechi side wit Dakuku Peterside under di umbrella of di APC to rival Wike, but in di end Wike win di 2015 govnorship election and win di 2019 election again. Even though some state govnors dem don dethrone dia godfather alias pipo wey bring dem to power, Nigerians believe say di Edo case go bring total end to  godfatherism especially as di kontri prepare to elect new leaders for 2023.

politics	Edo election update: Why Edo state matter to APC	"Politics na game of numbers and every state dey important to any political party. For Nigeria ruling All Progressive Congress party, di more states wey dem get to govern, di more power wey dem go fit enjoy on top different states. Until Edo state governor Godwin Obaseki bin resign from APC on June 16, 2020, di party bin dey control 21 states while opposition Peoples Democratic Party bin dey im charge of 15 states. As govnor Obaseki register as PDP member on Friday June 19, e mean say di party now get 16 states, at least till di September 19 happun. On top of dat, Edo na di only state wey APC bin fit get for South-South Nigeria afta di 2019 govornorship election for Nigeria. Lawyer and political sabi pesin Liborous Oshoma, say as long as APC remain for Edo state, e go easy for dem to get di oda south south states.

If APC fail to win di govnorship election wey suppose happun on September 19, dat go mean say di party no get any power at all for di oil rich Niger Delta region. Anoda reason why APC want Edo na sake of di power struggle between di party national chairman Adams Oshiomhole and di govnor Godwin Obaseki. Oga Oshoma say, ""for Adams Oshiomhole, govnorship election for di state go be big statement for am to stamp e authority back as many pipo dey blame say im make di party lose di state to PDP.""

Plenty gbas gbos don already happun between di two inside Edo APC as di state dey prepare for election. Di gbege hot sotey e dey affect di national body of di party, and more gbege still dey road. One very strong effect of dis wahala na di fact say now di party get two acting national chairman, one wey court appoint afta e uphold Oshio Baba suspension and di oda wey di national working committee (NWC) appoint. Di two chairmen don begin dey give different order. While Victor Giadom wey court appoint say, im don cancel all decision wey Oshiomhole don make since court suspend am for March 4; Hilliard Etta wey NWC appoint say make e act as chairman to continue from wia oga Oshiomhole stop before appeal court confam im suspension on June 16. Giadom faction say dem no give instruction for di party to do primary today Monday 22 June, but Etta faction say primary must to happen today."" Lawyer Oshoma say, if dem continue to dey give counter order, e go easy for ""di court to say since una bin dey give directive and counter directive therefore e no clear for INEC to monitor wetin una dey do."" As di ruling All Progressive Congress party do dia govnorship primary today so many gbege dey ground already wey fit affect di party chance to control di state. ""If at any time di court say Giadom na di authentic acting chairman and im insist say im no go do primary witin di time of INEC guideline, e den mean say APC no get candidate. But if na otherwise den e mean say di primaries wey APC do today dey valid"" na so Oga Oshoma tok."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/media-53137088

Dat na di major question pipo dey ask afta Rivers state govnor Nyesom Wike make im revelation. Di govnor reveal say Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari don approve and release di unpaid 13% derivation deduction since 1999 to all States for di Niger  Delta. Di tok bin come out as claim but BBC Pidgin reach out to oda states for di region to confam say na true. Oga Wike during one of im programmes for Port Harcourt say di payment of dis money by President Buhari na di major source of revenue for im projects. “Make I tok am for di first time. So many pipo dey ask wia i dey get dis money?' Make I tok am. Na from mister President,” e tok. E add say “Money wey dem never pay to di Niger Delta states since 1999 wey be di 13 percent deductions presido approve and pay all of us from di Niger Delta states.”  Di derivation principle na say if dem dey collect natural resources for any state wey dey bring revenue, goment go give back a certain percentage of dat revenue back to dat State. Goment go den put di remaining money for di Federation Account wey dem go share to oda States, na so di law tok. Di 13% derivation fund dey come from di federation revenue to oil producing communities through di State goments as e dey for  Section 162 (2) of di Nigerian constitution. Di federal goment dey pay dis 13% derivation to oil producing areas as part of benefits transfer scheme for di oil resources wey dem take from di State and eight states currently dey benefit from di scheme Di states na Rivers, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Edo, Bayelsa states, Imo and Abia states. Di 13% derivation fund dey different from di 3% money wey dem dey give host communities for di Petroleum Industry Act from di oil company operating expenses (OPEX). Data from di National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show say oil producing states for Nigeria share N450.60 billion from di Federation account through di 13 percent derivation formula for 2021.

Oga Fidelis Tilije, Commissioner for Finance say contrary to di ""revelation"" by Wike, Delta State only receive N14.7 billion in three quarterly instalments of N4.9 billion each. ""Wit di agreed amounts settled, some states like Rivers approach commercial banks and discount dia own in full and collect am, but Senator Ifeanyi Okowa say im no go wan leave di next administration with a huge debt burden. So e decide to discount only N150 billion out of di N240 billion expected receivables but later cut am down to N100 billion, di finance commissioner explain. ""So far, we don get N14.7 billion in three quarterly instalments and we also don access N30 billion out of di N100 billion we apply for as bridging finance.” Bayelsa State govnor, Senator Douye Diri  for im reaction  say dem dey spend di 13% oil derivation funds mostly on infrastructure development.

Shaun na Liverpool fan, mainly because of im brother. E tell BBC Sport say: ""I bin dey watch games with am and di first one wey leave in mark on me na di 2005 Champions League final. Ever since den, I dey obsessed wit Liverpool. Kick off for di Games na 3pm West African time. None of these teams don win yet, but na Newcastle I dey worry more about. Wen I look di way Leeds dey play and I feel say di results go turn around for dem soon, but dat no be di case for Newcastle. Magpies boss Steve Bruce dey under pressure already and dat go only increase if tins go badly for dem on Friday night. Lawro prediction: 1-2 Aqib prediction: If Newcastle score, den Leeds too go score - but I feel say wit 50,000 fans for St James Park, e go make di difference. 2-1 Shaun prediction: I bin write down 2-1 to Leeds but I go change my mind and go wit a draw, because Newcastle dey house. I see Leeds taking di lead, and dat go make Newcastle push on. 2-2 Wolves goal against Watford di last time na gift, even though dem bin play well for dat game. I feel say dem go pick up anoda win here. Brentford last-gasp defeat against Brighton last week fit affect small. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Aqib prediction: Wolves no really dey score many goal but dem be good team. Brentford moral high right now though, so dem fit collect something here. 1-1 Shaun prediction: Brentford so far dis season start well but I tink Wolves just start to get tins going. 2-1 Sean Dyche new contract na great news for Burnley. Dem need am more dan ever dis season, if dem go stay up. Di Clarets bin play well against Everton on Monday, just like dem do against Liverpool at di start of di season, but dem no get anytin out of either game. I feel say dat fit change on Saturday. Arsenal bin get dia first goal, and first win, against Norwich - but dis go be a very different game, and e go be a real test for dem. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Aqib prediction: Burnley go fit try to bully Arsenal but I tink di Gunners go- go through dat - dem really need a win too. 0-2 Shaun prediction: I know Arsenal beat Norwich but dem bin no dey convincing. I fancy Burnley here. 1-0 Liverpool get good week so far wit wins ova Leeds and AC Milan and I feel say dat run go continue here. Crystal Palace bin get good result last week wen dem beat Tottenham, but I feel say dia result go dey go up and down for a while. Lawro prediction: 3-0 Aqib prediction: I want Palace to win and I dey see good tins wey go happun under Patrick Vieira, but na huge ask for dem to go Anfield and stop Liverpool, wey all dia best players dey in form at di moment. 3-1 Shaun prediction: I feel say Palace go score but we go win dis one. Our defenders don return back and we strong for our house. 3-1. Manchester City don score 16 goals for dia three home games dis season and I no tink say Southampton fit stop dem. Saints gatz adjust to losing Danny Ings, but I no tink say dem go struggle dis season - I no just fancy dem to get anything out of dia trip to Etihad Stadium. Lawro prediction: 4-0 Aqib prediction: I dey hope for a Theo Walcott hat-trick but I know say e no go happun. 4-0 Shaun prediction: City dey play well at di moment and dem fit tear Southampton to bits. 4-0. Norwich don score one goal wit no points from dia first four games, while Watford dey on di run of three straight defeats. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Aqib prediction: Norwich no dey score enough goals to get anything out of dia games. 1-2 Shaun prediction: E dey hard to see Norwich winning at di moment. 0-1 Well, di Rafael Benitez revival still dey on for Everton - im bin change di team to spark dia fightback as dem beat Burnley. Aston Villa bin lose to Chelsea last weekend but dem bin look good for dat game for a long time - dem bin get plenty of chances for di first half. E go dey close, but I dey tip Dean Smith side to collect di points here. As good as Everton dey, we see as dem shake for dat game against di Clarets and I feel say Villa go give dem wahala. Lawro prediction: 2-1 Aqib prediction: Goals go dey for dis one. Everton don turn into machine under Benitez, although I feel say for James Rodriguez as dem no dey look im side. Im be beautiful footballer. 2-3 Shaun prediction: For some reason, I bin dey see 0-0. Everton dey look very good at di moment though, so I gatz go with dem to win. 0-2 Brighton v Leicester (14:00 West African Time) Everybody go dey expect Leicester to win these kind of games now, but I no tink say e go dey straightforward for dem at all. Brighton bin leave am late to beat Brentford last time out but dem dey form now afta dem win three of dia first four games. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Aqib prediction: I neva go for 0-0 yet, a bi? Goals go plenty dis weekend. 1-2 Shaun prediction: Brighton start dis season no bad but Leicester go dey too strong for dem. 0-2 West Ham striker Michail Antonio suspension for dis game na big blow for dem. I know Manchester United bin no too play well for dia midweek Champions League match but I no tink say e go stop dem from qualifying out of di group. Lawro prediction: 0-2 Aqib prediction: I hope say wetin happun against Young Boys go help United get back on track as dem suppose. 0-2 Shaun prediction: Antonio na big miss for West Ham, because im be big threat for dia team. I hate to tok am but United get real chance to win di league dis season wit di quality wey dem get for dia side. Cristiano Ronaldo go continue to score goals and Bruno Fernandes na baba wen it comes to making dem. 0-3 Tottenham bin fall hand last week as dem lose to Crystal Palace, and for me, all I see for dis game na Chelsea win. Dem dey enough to keep Spurs out, and dem get players wey go cause problems for field.. Lawro prediction: 1-2 Aqib prediction: Dem no be di most entertaining team to watch, but e hard to beat Chelsea now. 1-2 Shaun prediction: Chelsea dey very strong. 1-2"	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/sport-58600151

So wetin you fit do if you find yourself in dis kain of situation? We ask experts and one survivor of domestic abuse to share dia advice. ""Wen you dey for inside abusive relationship, you go notice one pattern,"" Esther* tell me, as she tink back to di three years she spend married to man wey she tok say bin dey abuse her  regularly - physically and verbally. ""Weekends dey always worse, because everybody dey for house. Your partner get more time for dia hands and fit get bored too. So you go see say dem wan find trouble.

""If two days fit make pesin dey bored enough to make dem wan hit you, imagine wetin one month or so of lockdown don cause pipo. No be just boredom dis time, na stress, na fear."" Several years don pass now since Esther leave her husband. And even though, practically, e bin dey more easier to comot dan e go be today, e still take time and courage. ''I feel say I dey place wia get bars and I no fit comot because economically, emotionally, psychologically, e hard well well - and den my children dey too. Also, your mama dey happy say you don marry, so you dey reason - keep her happy. Stay.'' For women wey wan leave dia partner now during lockdown, di challenge dey even bigger.

"For di Edo Governorship election wey go hold on 19 September, 2020, only two women among di 14 candidates dey contest for di Governorship position and two women dey contest for deputy governor. Di two female governorship candidates na Mabel Oboh of African Democratic Congress (ADC), and Agol Tracy of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP); while di two female deputy governorship candidates na Mogbelehan Pauline of Labour Party (LP) and Omion Omonye of Social Democratic Party (SDP).

Tracy Ebun Agol wey dey contest for di Edo Governorship election for di second time tell BBC Pidgin say di participation of women in politics for Edo State still dey very-very low and e get why. ""Fear of victimisation, fear of oppression and family fears naim keep dem away from politics. But di few of us wey don enta di political arena, we dey hold our head high and we refuse to be oppressed, we refuse to be intimidated and we refuse to be harassed."" Di NNPP candidate say men don dominate di political scene for too long and di women no dey help matters because even wen dem go to canvass for votes from fellow women, dem no dey take am serious. ""Di first tin na for dem to come out to vote. Dem get dia voters card and dat one don give dem power to change di situation and comot Edo State from di cabal wey don oppress dem for so long and put a capable woman wey go change tins."" Mabel Oboh wey dey contest for govnor under Africa Democratic Congress ADC add say di reason why Edo never get female govnor dey similar to di reason why Nigeria never get female president: women no dey gree come out to contest. Mabel Oboh say if women get for mind say as dem dey come contest dem go face challenges but dem still get di determination to go through, dem go succeed. Oboh also call on political parties to encourage women to step forward to contest and also support dem to win. If di political parties get structures wey go encourage and push womento contest and support dem to win, many of dem wey get di capacity and intelligence go come forward and make impact. ""Di way we dey do politics too gatz change. Politics need plenty money but wetin dem dey use di money do, no be to buy votes? If pipo realise say dat money dem collect dem dey sell dia future and right to good governance, tins go change. So we also need to change our orientation of wetin politics suppose be and support pipo wey get vision and capacity to serve cos politics na call to serve pipo not di oda way round."" Goldfish Rahmatulai wey be lawyer and politician add say na big very challenge for women in politics for Edo State as di first time a woman try come out to contest na 2007 but she no win di party nomination, na aspiration e end. Dat same year, three women enter di House of Assembly and one become di Speaker but she only last for three months before dem ask her to step down to become di deputy speaker. ""Women na di ones wey get voice. Na dem be active mobilizers and campaigners but na dia e end. Dem dey always sideline dem for di roundtable wen di main political negotiations dey go on. Wetin make political meeting dey always hold for night? Once woman comot and stay out late sake of political waka, pipo go begin advice di husband say she dey neglect di home, some go call her names say she dey wayward, dey follow man and sleep wit dem to get political position and wen dem try come out, many times dem dey induce dem to drop dia ambition.

Officials dey currently compare di results wey di commission receive in di form of foto from di polling stations wit di actual results sheet, wey dem dey hand over to di collation centre for di capital, Nairobi.

Wit di speed of di counting wey dey ongoing, di local media dey likely to conclude dia own collation of results before di end of Thursday. If clear leader emerge for di race, celebrations fit start. However, only di electoral commission fit declare winner afta comparing and verifying di results. Di electoral commission get seven days afta election day to declare di result. To win di presidential race for di first round, a candidate need: If not, voting go enta second round wey by law must happun by 8 September."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-62508390

Di numbers still dey tiny for kontri of 1.4 billion pipo and officially just over 5,200 pipo don die since di pandemic begin.

While China zero-Covid policy don really save lives, e don also affect di economy and ordinary pipo lives. Di kontri slightly relax some of those restrictions few weeks ago. China bin cut quarantine for close contacts from seven days for one state facility to five days and three days at home, and also stop to dey record secondary contacts wey allow many more pipo to avoid having to quarantine.

Part of di reason be say vaccination levels dey lower dan in oda developed nations, and only half of di pipo wey dey di age of over 80 get dia primary vaccinations. China don refuse to import vaccines upon evidence say dia homemade jabs neva prove say e dey effective.

politics	Five lessons we learn from Ekiti govnorship election	"By Victor Ezeama Di governorship election for Ekiti state don end afta one day of voting without major wahala. Na former Secretary to di State Goverment, Biodun Oyebanji, win di low-key election. Kayode Oyebode, returning officer for di election, announce Oyebanji as governor-elect of Ekiti state early mor-mor of Sunday.\nOyebanji secure 187,057 votes to win di election. E defeat im two closest rivals — Segun Oni of Social Democratic Party (SDP) wey get 82,211 votes, and Bisi Kolawole of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) wey get 67,457 votes. ""Say Abiodun Abayomi Oyebanji of APC, having satisfied di requirements of di law, dey hereby declared  winner and returned elected,” di Inec returning officer for di election announce. Dis na di major takeaways from di election. Di election start well on Saturday 18 June as adhoc staff of di Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) arrive dia polling stations early.\nVoters also arrive dia units early to begin confam dia names for Inec list and prepare to vote. Police and security deployment also dey available to ensure say jaguda pipo no scatter di election.\nDi election start as Inec plan am by 8:30am and by 10:30am election don finish for some polling units. Wen dem swear am in Biodun Oyebanji go become di 8th govnor of Ekiti state since Nigeria return to democracy for 1999. Since di return to civilian rule, record show say no party don dey for goment back to back for Ekiti. Dis na because di state no dey experience political continuity. Becos of dis, every govnorship election for Ekiti since 1999 don produce different winners from different political parties. Although Oyebanji na different pesin from di current govnor Kayode Fayemi, dis na di first time di same political party dey retain power for di state. Im performance for office go determine if APC go remain for power afta 2026. Di Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) na di main opposition party for Ekiti state but dem carry third position for di election. According to Inec, candidate of di PDP Bisi Kolawole get 67,457 votes - behind Segun Oni of Social Democratic Party (SDP) wey get 82,211 votes. Dis one happun despite say oga Oni just join SDP three months to di election. Before di election, di PDP for di state bin get ogbonge crisis wey even di national leadership of di party no fit resolve. Di fight na between one serving Senator Abiodun Olujimi and former govnor Ayo Fayose - di two dey drag who be leader of di party for di state. Dem carry di wahala go dia primaries wey produce Bisi Kolawole wey many pipo feel say na weak candidate. Also, di fight between former Deputy govnor Kolapo Eleka and Fayose also further contribute to di division of di party. For di 18 November, 2021 governorship election for Anambra state, Inec introduce di Biomdial voter accreditation system (Bvas) for di conduct of election. Di Bvas machine na to allow voters accredit and vote at di same time. But di machine no work well for Anambra. However, Inec say di machine go remain for Nigeria election process and dem go make am good as di commission dey conduct more election. Dis na why Inec improve di functionality of di machine ahead of di Ekiti election. Dem deploy di machine wey make voting fast and easy. Complain no too dey from voters about di use of di Bvas machine. Na for dis election Inec also test wetin dem call electronic transmission of results. Unlike before wey polling officers go need to carry hard copy of result sheets go local moment for collation - now dem get transmit di result electronically to Inec and den later go submit di hard copy for verification. Dis one make di collation result for Ekiti dey very fast and easy. As at 5pm on Election Day Inec don receive results from 14 out of di 16 local government areas of di state. Di e-transmission also make am hard for pipo to alter or tamper wit results from polling units. ""See and buy"" and ""our vote no be for one pot of soup"" na di popular slang wey voters dey tok during di election on Saturday. Dis na sake of di clear cases of vote buying for majority of di polling units for di state. Vote buying na one of di most popular election offences for Nigeria. Di trend don grow over di years becos political parties bin dey hide dey do am. But dis days, dem don dey do am openly. Sadly, most voters dey also look forward to collecting money afta voting. Odas dey even show am for social media. For Ekiti, Nigeria anti corruption agency Economic and Financial crimes commission (EFCC) arrest some pipo on allegation say dem dey pay voters. Videos wey dem post for social media show wia dem parade some of di suspects wit cash and names of voters. Also, election monitoring group Yiaga Africa for dia preliminary report say dia observers ""find out several cases of vote buying during di election. ""Di vote buying dey happun for open spaces and some parties dey pay as much as N7 ,000 per vote."" Overall, Inec prepare well for di election and finish am on time but di issue of vote buying na big problem."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c06vgkgzjlgo

Wen one reporter ask Biden if  United States go defend Taiwan if dem attack am, di president answer: ""Yes."" ""Dat na di commitment wey we make,"" Joe Biden say, during one joint news conference wit di Japanese leader. ""We agree wit one-China policy. We don sign am plus all di intended agreements wey dem make inside. ""But di idea say, dem fit to take am by force, just take am by force, no just dey, no just dey appropriate."" Im add say im dey expect say dat kain tin no go happun or dey attempted. Following Biden comments, one White House official say e no get any change for policy towards Taiwan. Di president national security aides shift for dia seats and bend dia heads, dey study Biden closely as im respond to di question on Taiwan. Plenti bin look down as im make wetin resemble not so clear commitment to Taiwan defence. Biden make similar comment about defending Taiwan for October. During dat time, one White House tok tok pesin say Biden bin no dey announce any change in U.S. policy. And one analyst refer to di comment as ""gaffe"" or blunder. United States bin don agree long ago say na one China, including Taiwan. But it e don adopt im ""strategic ambiguity"" on di question of weda e go involve imsef in military conflict over di island. Di tok dey come as Biden make tough comments about China increasingly self-confident for di region. Di president say im hope say Russia President Vladimir Putin go pay price for im invasion of Ukraine in part to show China wetin e go face if e invade Taiwan. Di comments dey likely to both provoke Beijing and overshadow di koko of Biden Japan visit, wey be to achieve one Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Di framework be broad plan wey go provide economic pillar for U.S. engagement with Asia. Im trip include meetings wit di leaders of Japan, India and Australia, for di ""Quad"" group of kontris."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/61550191

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, wey pipo see as as influential force for di Conservative party, tell di im dey ""lean towards"" supporting Johnson.

Scotland Frist Minister Nicola Sturgeon describe Johnson return as ""ridiculous suggestion"". Liberal Democrats wey dey attempt to block Johnson becoming prime minister through motion for parliament describe di former UK prime minister as ""Britain's Berlusconi"". Oga Johnson don surprisingly keep low profile since leaving office. E no dey too tok for di House of Commons and spend di past few weeks doing speaking tour of di US before going on holiday. But Johnson biographer Andrew Gimson point out say di man no be pesin to ""live a life of blameless obscurity"". If only single candidate emerge, di contest go dey over on Monday - if not, dem go chose di new leader by a vote from party membership on Friday 28 October. Survey dem do in di final days of Liz Truss' premiership don continue to show Johnson as di most popular successor. Patrick English, Associate Director of polling company YouGov, say di Conservative party dey find ""pesin wey fit provide unity and pull di party back togeda and compete again (Labour leader) Keir Starmer. ""If you ask di members who dat pesin be - na Boris Johnson,"" oga English tok. ""If oga Johnson enta di final two, e get advantage."" A Boris Johnson candidacy go also work in favour of oda candidates, according to oga English. Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt, wey contest to replace am, be like pipo wey go re-contest. ""I tink if we dey tok about unity and decisive candidates oga Sunak and oga Johnson na di two pipo wey fit divide di party,"" oga Johnson tok."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/world-63349835

business	How South Africa president survive impeachment move over cash-in-sofa scandal	"MPs for one special sitting of South Africa parliament on Tuesday vote to reject one move to begin impeachment proceedings against President Cyril Ramaphosa. Dem accuse di president of covering up di theft of one large sum of foreign currency from im farm in 2020, some of which bin dey hidden inside one sofa. Di debate before di vote bin focus on an independent report wey conclude say e fit don violate di constitution. Oga Ramaphosa, wey dey prepare for re-election as ANC leader, deny any wrongdoing. Di African National Congress bin tell im MPs to block possible impeachment - although a handful break ranks and join hand with opposition parties and vote to accept di report and let impeachment proceedings start. Now wey Oga Ramaphosa don survive di vote, belief dey say e dey likely to win re-election for im party conference, wey go start on Friday. E go den be in pole position to become di ANC presidential candidate for di next election in 2024. Di sitting to debate to di report, wey dey commission from one panel of legal experts by di speaker, open wit one discussion over whether dem should allow MPs to vote in secret - something wey di speaker bin reject. At di end of di debate, dem read out di names of individual MPs and each one announce dia vote. Some 214 lawmakers vote against setting up impeachment committee, while 148 vote in favour, dem register two abstention. Di 70-year-old leader don deny any wrongdoing calling di report, wey e don also challenge for di Constitutional Court, ""flawed"". Oga Ramaphosa become president for 2018 pledging to tackle corruption. Naim  replace Jacob Zuma, whose time for office bin dey weighed down by many such allegations. Dis scandal show facein June, wen one former South African spy boss, Zuma-ally Arthur Fraser, file one complaint wit police accusingdi president of hiding theft of $4m (£3.25m) in cash from im Phala Phala game farm in 2020. Oga Ramaphosa admit say dem bin tiff some money, wey bin dey hidden in a sofa, but e say na $580,000 not $4m. Di president say di $580,000 bin come from di sale of buffalo, but di panel, wey dey headed by one former chief justice, say e get ""substantial doubt"" about whether a sale take place. South Africa get strict rules on holding foreign currency, wey say dat it gatz dey deposited with an authorised dealer such as bank with 30 days. E appears as though di president fit don break those rules, according to di panel report. Furthermore, if di money na from selling buffalo as e tok, dis money supposed dey declared, rather dan keep am in cash. For im submission to di Constitutional Court, Oga Ramaphosa want di kontri top judges to rule say di findings of di panel dey unlawful and set aside. Di president argue say di panel go beyond im scope wen dem dey look  at whether e bin get a case to answer related to di robbery for di farm. E dey also ask di court make dem declare say any steps wey di parliament take on di back of di release of the report dey unlawful and invalid. Analysis by Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg Di dominance of di ANC for parliament don save Oga Ramaphosa future in politics. Im chances of being re-elected as ANC president for di party national conference now don get more boost. However, events for parliament show say once again deep divisionsdey for di governing party. Four Pro-Zuma supporters, wey include former African Union chairperson, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma - one ogbonge party member - bin vote with opposition parties. Di opposition bin try, and fail, to push for secret ballot as dem sense say more members fit break ranks. But Tuesday win na only political, and not legally binding. Oga Ramaphosa go still need to get di Constitutional Court to weigh in on di mata, though some experts say di judges dey likely to side wit am afta parliament, wey commission di investigate, bin reject im own report. For now, on top of one huge sigh of relief, Oga Ramaphosa march on wit severe political bruises - im credibility and ability to govern go come into even sharper focus."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c9rl22gyln4o

health	Omicron: Why Nigeria dey di travel red list?	"Nigeria dey UK travel red list - move wey United Kingdom goment tok say go help slow di spread of di Omicron variant. But di Nigeria High Commissioner to London, Ambassador Sarafa Tunji Isola say di travel restrictions na ""travel apartheid"". So why Nigeria dey di red list, and e dered list 1y fair? Wetin be red list? Nigeria na di latest African kontri to join UK travel red list - wit South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. Di only pipo wey dey allowed to enta UK from dis kontris na UK or Irish citizens, or UK residents. Pipo wey arrive from red list kontris go need to enta hotel quarantine - wit dia own moni - and isolate for 10 days. Dem dey target dis kontris sake of Omicron variant wey dem first identify for southern Africa. But di fact say all di kontris wey currently dey di list na from Africa, don dey criticised as ""wicked and unfair"". Di decision to put kontri for dis list dey based on risk assessments from di Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) - one scientific body wey dey advise goment. Dis assessment include: Di UK goment tok say dem add Nigeria to di list be say: Di JBC report summarise informate wey dem use make specific decision for each kontri, but dem neva publish di one for Nigeria. UK goment statement wey announce Nigeria addition to di red list said ""majority"" of Omicron variant cases for UK ""get clear links to overseas travel from South Africa and Nigeria"". Reported Covid cases for Nigeria dey far lower compared wit most of Europe, wia dem dey identify around 90 cases a day ova di past week - but testing for Africa dey way below Europe levels. During di last week of November, Nigeria do about 0.07 tests per 1,000 pipo a day, as dem compare am wit about 14 per 1,000 for UK and about 8 per 1,000 for France. Nigeria still identify fewer cases per test for week wey enta 2 December dan several oda European kontris plus South Africa wia dem first detect Omicron. Based on test mata, all kontris dey collect and share data differently and dis dey make am tricky to compare internationally. UK goment collect data on pipo wey test positive for Covid afta dem arrive UK. Di latest informate or data wey we get from di beginning of November, wey show percentage of pipo wey test positive afta dem travel from Nigeria dey around 1% - similar to several European kontris. Nigerian Centers for Disease Control (NCDC) don identify only three cases of Omicron for di kontri, all of dem dey linked to travel from South Africa. Dis na fewer cases dan several European kontris, including UK wia dem don report 336 Omicron cases. However NCDC data dey five days old, so di numbers fit don go up since. Genome sequencing - di process wey dem dey use to identify variants of virus - no dey advanced for Nigeria compared wit UK or South Africa, for example. Dis fit mean say dem no fit effectively tell di extent of di spread of Omicron. Di genome sequencing wey dem need to identify new variants dey very sophisticated and e rare. Di Department of Health say for England, 21 Omicron cases get link to travel from Nigeria. Kontri vaccination rate na also wetin dem dey consider before restricting travel, although dis na just ""contextual information"" plus genome sequencing ability and Covid transmission. Vaccination rates for Africa dey well below di world average. For Nigeria, as of 5 December, na just 4.8 doses dem don give per 100 people, compared with more than 178 per 100 people for UK."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/world-59551630

You remember Moneyball - di feem wey Brad Pitt recruit baseball players from Oakland A based on Informate wey im get? Well, one London-based investment company Carteret Analytics feel say dem get one formula for footballers, wey dey dia system to take advise three Premier League clubs on new players dem fit sign. According to dia finding from dis transfer market, Arsenal fit don pay too much money for Nicolas Pepe, Everton suppose get more from Idrissa Gueye and one newly promoted team get one of di best deals of di window. Carteret Analytics use dia system to advise seven clubs for England top two league dem and 12 big clubs from Europe and di rest of di world too. Di data based on player value - dem go calculate fee based on dia performance for di club wey dey sell dem and di impact dem go get from di club wey dey buy dem plus dia age wey dey within (usually 26-30). Also, di value as per money aspect wey di player dey contribute to win football match and di kain influence wey im get to create and stop goal-scoring opportunity dem. By di time dem check dis value, clubs go make up dia mind to know how much dem want collect for di player head and how much too dem dey ready to spend ontop new player dem wey dem wan buy. Arsenal bin dey hot seat  for transfer deadline day- dem sell Alex Iwobi to Everton and bring in Chelsea defender David Luiz and Celtic full- back Kieran Tierney. But how come dem dey for di bad business side. Iwobi real value wen im bin dey Arsenal rise up to £46.26m but dem sell am for just £27.36m, wey suggest say dem undervalue am by almost £19m. Arsenal sign Ivory Coast winger Nicolas Pepe from Lille for club record fee of £72m- £21.77m pass im real value figure. And dem buy teenage defender William Saliba cheap from Saint-Etienne and let dia former captain Laurent Koscielny go to Bourdeaux for more dan £20m under im projected fee. But Arsenal bring in replacement for Koscielny for good value. Dem rate Chelsea Luiz for £34.8m but Unai Emery team bring am in for  £7.8m - no be bad deal for pesin wey don win Premier League and Champions League with plenty years of experience for England. Even though Crystal Palace sell dia best young player, dem do beta business for di transfer window according to Carteret Analytics data. And dem keep dia main player Wilfried Zaha, Palace buy Swansea striker Jordan Ayew for just £2.5m - wey less dan im intrinsic value. Dey also collect beta money for defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka, although im value fit rise for future for Manchester United. Dem sell Wan-Bissaka for £49.5m, im intrinsic value for Palace na just £23.32m. But dem expect di value to rise £43m for United but it still dey short of di money dem pay for am. Everton surprise pipo with di signing of 19-year-old forward Moise Kean from Italian champions Juventus. And di deal no bad, dem pay just £4m ontop im projected value. Dem also sign Manchester City Fabian Delph for under £9m.Dem bin value di England international for £54.58m to im selling club. Andre Gomes' permanent move from Barcelona cost just £22.5m too, a fee wey low pass im intrinsic value to Everton. And of course, di signing of Arsenal Iwobi na anoda good business. But Everton no shine eye wen dem sell. Midfielder Idrissa Gueye move to Paris St-Germain fall short of im £26m intrinsic value. Di best business happun for clubs wey dey outside di Premier League top six. Wolves smart for dia business for transfer market, dem sign loan players on permanent deals. Benfica sign Mexico striker Raul Jimenez, wey score 15 goals for 37 games last season for club record of £34m- na good deal because im intrinsic value na £43.37m. Dem also pay less for Belgian midfielder Leander Dendoncker wey value reach £16.13m afta im join dem on permanent deal from Anderlecht.

Even for dis 21st century, tori about anatomy, monthly changes, hygiene and plenty tori wey dem fit dey experience still dey strange to some women. Some experts don put together some things wey fit help women understand dia female sexual organ [vagina] beta. Di vagina dey inside di body - na di elastic muscular canal wey connect di vulva to di cervix and di uterus. Vulva na di correct word to use wen you dey tok about di external part of di female sex organs. Na di vulva hold di pubis, urethral opening, clitoris, labia minora and the labia majora and vaginal opening. Di external structure of di vulva consist of di labia majora - dis na di outer lips of di vagina, di labia minora - di inner lips and di clitoris - one highly sensitive & erogenous zone wey get more nerve endings than any other part of woman body. Dis fit shock you. While men dey pee from their penis, women dey pee from di urethra (one tubular structure wey dey carry piss from di bladder to outside of di body). From front to back, di first hole na di urethra and then di vagina, wey dey above di anus. Public hair get work wey e dey do. E dey serve as protective barrier to di genital tissues and vaginal opening. E also dey prevent infection. Obstetrician-gynaecologist, Dr Jen Gunter say she notice say plenty women dey like shave dia pubic hair. She say e dey okay but e get risk. Dr Gunter add join say waxing or shaving of di pubic hair fit cause microscopic trauma to di skin, plus e fit cause cuts, abrasions, infections. Many women dey shy to tok about di pain dem dey experience during kerewa [sex]. However, E dey important to know say sex no suppose dey painful. Sabi pipo advise say if you dey experience any kain pain during kerewa visit your doctor or gynaecologist. Di glands wey dey located for di lining of di vagina dey release one fluid wey naturally dey designed to dey lubricate and cleanse di vagina. When you use some kain soaps or cleaning devices, dem fit cause react wit di vagina natural pH balance and cause infections like thrush. To avoid dis, apply soap for di outer labia only. Dr Gunter say you no need use anything clean inside di vagina. She warn against using scented douches alias bathing soap as e fit increase di risk of catching sexually transmitted infections. Steaming, another trend, no dey necessary, e fit lead to burns. You fit clean di outer part of di vulval area when necessary wit water or a gentle cleanser. Vaginal cells dey replace themselves every 96 hours - e dey quick heal. You still fit catch some STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) even if you use condom. STDs like herpes, HPV, pubic lice and molluscum contagiosum still dey transferable. Dis na because di vulva still fit touch di blocus (or vice versa), during sex and dis fit cause infection. Most women no dey reach climax through vaginal penetration and sometimes dey need clitoral stimulation before dem fit experience orgasm. Dem fit achieve orgasm through masturbation, manual or cunnilingual stimulation by a sexual partner. Plenty lubrication of di vagina dey prevent painful sex and tissue tearing. Vaginal lubrication dey affected by di level of oestrogen for di body. Things like using birth control, menopause and breastfeeding fit change di oestrogen levels. Di lower your oestrogen levels, di more difficult e go dey for your vagina to lubricate naturally. As women dey grow old, di natural lubrication [wey be di wetness for di vagina] go dey dry up. Dem fit begin topical oestrogen treatments or manufactured vaginal lubricants to lubricate. If you get very dry vagina, you fit speak to your doctor and get solution. Whether you do operation (C-section) or you born naturally, most physicians dey recommend taking at least four to six weeks off before you begin kerewa, make di vagina for fit heal well-well. To dey get orgasm fit help relieve menstrual pain. Dis na because of di increase of blood flow wey dey occur during climaxing. In addition, when you orgasm, your uterine muscles go contract and release chemicals di brain wey go generate one natural pain reliever for menstrual cramps. Afta years of doing periods and maybe to born children, di ovaries go stop to dey produce eggs and menstruation go stop. Di amount of hormones for di body wey dey keep women fertile go drop dramatically - and low levels of oestrogen, in particular, dey affect di vagina and vulva. Vaginal farting [to mess] wey pipo sabi as ""queefing"", go happun to most women at some point for dia lives, especially during exercise and intercourse. Dis na because air dey escape from vagina and e go make dem dey mess. Pregnancy and childbirth fit change di vagina in plenty ways; Every single woman get different vagina odour sake of dia choice of fabric, from wetin dem like use as underwear, level of hygiene, diet, gland secretion and unique mix of internal bacteria. Di quality and quantity of vaginal discharge dey change sake of di different stages of your menstrual cycle. E usually dey be like off white wey look creamy tint when your cycle wan start. Small-small, di amount of discharge go dey increase as you dey near ovulation. When ovulation start, di discharge go dey thick small and e go dey pull when you touch am. E dey recommended make women do Kegel exercises afta dem born pikin to strengthen di vaginal muscles again.  Kegels dey easy to do and you fit do am anywhere at any time. In order for sperm to survive and swim inside di vagina, di vagina dey maintain acidic environment wit a pH balance of 4.5. Douching dey considered to be more harmful than beneficial as e dey disrupt di natural balance of bacteria and fit lead to infection. Most women no dey ejaculate during orgasm, but if you do, beta for you. Female ejaculation fit occur as di result of two different phenomena wey most pipo no sabi. Ejaculation dey produced in a small amount wit a milky or cloudy appearance, e dey comot from di paraurethral glands wey dey inside di urethra. for women wey dey experience ejaculation, di sensation dey orgasmic and e different from wen women dey piss. Dis two structures resemble well-well. Just like di penis, di clitoris get di frenulum (di small fold and ridge of di skin wey support di motion) and a prepuce (or 'clitoral hood' na fold of skin wey cover am). Di clitoral hood dey comprised of di same kind of tissues wey make up di foreskin for males. Like di penis, di clitoris get erectile tissues wey dey stand upon arousal. Every woman vulva dey different, some labia majora (outer lips) dey inside and some hang down, some dey symmetrical and others asymmetrical. You get both long and short outer lips. Labia minora also different for dia appearance and size, and e dey important to remember that when you dey compare yourself to porn stars, many of dem don do labiaplasty procedures to cosmetically change di appearance of di labia minora. Di colour of vulvar anatomy also dey completely different from one individual to another, some get light pink, others na dark brown, etc. Di vaginal canal dey one angle for your body, dis na why sometimes during kerewa or wen you dey put tampon, e go be like say you dey hit wall. Women get their own version of di condition dem dey call 'blue balls' wey na men dey normally experience am. Na discomfort for di penis and/or testicles sake of sexual frustration."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-56513949
politics	John Mahama vs Nana Akufo-Addo: Ghana elections 2020 economy and corruption score card	Ghana elections 2020 campaigns don end, now de 7 December polls proper be upon us. So for help Ghanaians get better understanding of de issues affecting Monday voting, BBC Pidgin torchlight de west African country economy and corruption scorecard since 2012. Ghana election 2020 na majorly between two candidates wey don once serve as President for Ghana within de last eight years. Former president John Dramani Mahama of de National Democratic Congress [NDC] and de incumbent president, Nana Akufo-Addo of de New Patriotic Party [NPP] be de main contestants for Ghana 2020 presidential race. Dis time de two candidates dey ask for four more years to make Ghana great again. Make we take a look at some key sectors, wetin dema promise versus wetin dem achieve for dia first term for office. NDC Manifesto promise for 2012 To focus im economic development priorities to better di lives of Ghanaians through investment and development policies • Maintain single digit rate of inflation; • Ensure exchange rate stability • Reduce gbese significantly • Maintain average annual growth rate of at least 8% NPP Manifesto promise for 2016 To build di most business-friendly and pipo friendly economy for Africa, wey go create jobs and prosperity for all Ghanaians. Achieve double digit GDP growth annually for four years Reduce di cost of doing business, maintain financial discipline, reduce government borrowing and reduce interest rates to encourage private businesses. Tori pipo for Fact check Ghana bin do research and dis na wetin dem find out as dem quote World Bank data to compare di monetray value and di GDP under di tenure of di Mahama-led NDC government and di incumbent Akufo-led NPP. From dis table, e show say under di Mahama-led NDC government, Ghana record GDP growth of 15.836 wey be average of 3.959% growth every year. Akufo-led government don record an accumulated growth of 21.784% wey translates to an average of 5.446%. Dis one mean say di GDP of Ghana don grow higher under di NPP goment than di NDC. NPP manifesto for 2016 promise; To commit to establish solid, efficient machinery for good governance, wey go make up of accountable goment and respect for di rule of law and human rights. One of di things wey dem promise to do na to establish, by  Act of Parliament, di Office of di Special Prosecutor, wey go dey independent of di Executive, Di special prosecutor go investigate and prosecute certain categories of cases and allegations of corruption and other criminal wrongdoing. All dis to ensure transparency for goment. NDC manifesto for 2012 promise; To stand gidigba to fight political corruption and immorality For di manifesto, di party promise to use di 2008 party promise to run di 2012 political tenure. For 2008, di NDC goment promise to deepen political accountability and transparency, disclose  budgets, public expenditure and procedures. How tins be? For one statement wey NPP release afta di resignation of di Special Prosecutor on Monday, 17th November, 2020, di party say di  record of corruption under di NDC leadership dey worst. Di Flagbearer of di NDC, John Mahama, during dia manifesto launch on September 7 for di University of Professional Studies, Accra condemn NDC performance on corruption. From wetin we gather from di Corruption Perception Index (CPI) report wey Transparency Index dey release every year to give insight on di presence of corruption in public office under a particular goment. See di table wey Fact Check Ghana draw up from Transparency Index report. Even though di CPI report for 2020 neva comot, di worst CPI score (di highest corruption perception) under di Mahama goment beta pass di best CPI score (di lowest corruption perception) under di Akufo-Addo NPP goment. Dis one mean say di Mahama led NDC goment handle corruption pass di Akufo Addo NPP goment. So now element number three which dey make Ghana elections exciting be say dis year, Ghanaians dey choose between govment which dey build infrastructure or govment wey dey strengthen economy. De opposition NDC John Mahama dey campaign on de grounds of en infrastructural achievement between 2012 - 2016. He build chaw top class hospitals, roads like circle interchange, new terminal for Ghana airport den stuff which more Ghanaians start dey appreciate after dem vote am out of power. Meanwhile, Prez Akufo-Addo too dey campaign on en record of economic transformation, growth in agriculture through planting for food and jobs, clean up of de banking sector, en handling of de COVID-19 pandemic den stuff. If Ghanaians vote give NDC, e mean say dem prefer physical infrastructure but if dem retain Prez Akufo-Addo, e mean say dem prefer say govment go build de economy.	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-55112945

Some of di oda govnorship candidates for di election na Yusuff Lasun of Labour Party, Akin Ogunbiyi of Accord Party, and Omigbodun Akinrinola of di Social Democratic Party. See di full list of candidates wey di Independent National Electoral Commission release. Di Resident Electoral Commissioner of di Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for Osun state, Professor Ganiy Raji say dem don fully ready for di govorship election. Professor Raji yarn dis one wen e follow BBC Pidgin tok for di commission office wey dey Osogbo, di state capital hours before dem begin dey share di sensitive materials wey dem go use for di election. Di REC tok say dem ready to hand over any pesin wey dem see say dey involve for any kain election wuu-wuru to di security agencies to ensure say wetin happun for Ekiti State govnorship election of 18 June, 2022, wia some political parties and some voters bin engage in vote-buying according to di Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) wey make some arrests, no happun for Osun State own. Na fifteen candidates dey battle for di govnorship seat of Osun and all of dem na male. Out of di fifteen deputy govnorship candidates, only six of dem be female. Di fact say no female govnorship candidate for di Osun election further show say na men dominate di Nigerian political space and female representation still dey low despite call for more women to join politics and be part of di affairs of nation building. Since di creation of di state, no woman don become elected govnor. Di Osun State govnorship election fit big pass di recently concluded one for Ekiti State wey see Biodun Oyebanji of di All Progressives Congress (APC) win becos of di population and if more pipo come out to vote. Oyebanji defeat im closest rival Segun Oni of di Social Democratic Party (SDP) for di June 18 election as Bisi Kolawole of di Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) carri third. But only 360,753 pipo out of di total 988,923 registered voters come out to vote and dis na just 36.5% voter turnout. While Ekiti State get just 16 local goment areas, Osun State get 30 local goment areas. Wetin e mean be say INEC go need to double dia effort for di Osun election to record success wey go show say dem dey fully prepared for di 2023 general elections. Sake of say dis na di last election for INEC hand before di general elections for 2023, di outcome of di election go show weda INEC dey prepared for di big election or not. Di last govnorship election wey happun for September 23, 2018, see Gboyega Oyetola as di winner. Although na Ademola Adeleke win di first round of di election, di Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declare di poll inconclusive sake of say di margin wey im take win dey less dan di number of votes wey dem cancel. For di first round of di election, Adeleke of di Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) score 254,698 votes, while Oyetola of di All Progressives Congress (APC) score 254,345 votes. Iyiola Omisore of Social Democratic Party (SDP) score 128,049 votes, Adeoti Moshood Olalekan of Action Democratic Party (ADP) score 49,744 votes, while Fatai Akinade Akinbade of African Democratic Congress (ADC) score 7,681. So na just 353 votes Adeleke take beat Oyetola and INEC bin cancel 3,498 votes for some polling units. Section 153 of di Electoral Act tok say Inec go need to conduct a rerun if di margin of victory for election dey lower dan di number of voters for units wia dem cancel elections. So a rerun need to hold for areas wia dem cancel elections. INEC conduct di rerun between di two top candidates on September 27 2018, and by di time dem collate all di previous and current results, Oyetola score 255,505 votes, while Adeleke score 255,023. So at di end of di day, Oyetola use 482 votes pass Ademola and INEC declare am as winner of di election. Osun govnorship election timetable change sake of di legal battle wey follow di 2007 gubernatorial election for di state. One Court of Appeal for Benin overturn di electoral victory of Olagunsoye Oyinlola and declare Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola as di rightful winner of di election afta three years of court case. E remain only one year for Oyinlola to complete im second tenure before court overturn im electoral victory. So Aregbesola kon begin im own first tenure as govnor in 2010 and end am in 2014. Im win re-election for 2014 and lead di state till 2018. Di last election for di state na in 2018 wey di current Govnor Gboyega Oyetola win as im defeat Ademola Adeleke of di Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Di election go be di seventh gubernatorial election for di state. Na di military regime of Ibrahim Babangida create Osun State from di old Oyo State for August 27, 1991. Isiaka Adeleke, broda of di PDP govnorship candidate, become di govnor of di state for January 1992 till November 1993 wen di military junta of Babangida dissolve all political offices afta im annul di June 12 presidential election. Di electoral system na modified two-round system, wey mean say before candidate fit dey declared as winner, im need to receive di plurality of di votes and ova 25% of di votes for at least two-thirds of di state local goment areas. If any candidate no get to dis level, dem go hold anoda round of election between di top candidates. For di second round, any candidate wey receive a plurality of votes for di highest number of local goment areas na im win di election. Di tenure of Gboyega Oyetola go come to an end for November 2022 and di winner of di July 16 govnorship election go begin a new goment. Five out of di 15 govnorship candidates meet during di debate wey BBC Yoruba organise to discuss wetin dem go do for Osun State if dem win di election.

entertainment	Shakira don join oda stars wey sell di rights to dia songs - See di reason why	"Shakira don become di latest artist to sell di rights to her music for multi-million dollar sum. All her 145 songs, including Hips Don't Lie, Whenever, Wherever and She Wolf, dey included for di deal. Di songs don make her di best-selling female Latin artist of all time, wit 80 million records she don sell worldwide. She strike di deal wit di Hipgnosis Song Fund, wey recently buy Blondie and Neil Young's music. Hipgnosis company no disclose di financial details of di deal, but e dey always pay di equivalent of 15 years' royalties up front. Wit di tax money dem don already pay, many of di artists dey always waka wit ""about 25 years worth of money at once, di owner of di company, Merck Mercuriadis, tell BBC last year. Dis dey provide di artists wit immediate financial security, while Hipgnosis - wey go later get di songs go dey hope to profit as e go dey plan to make new profit streams for di music through film and TV licensing, merchandise, cover versions and performance royalties. Hipgnosis don dey spend billion of dollars for some years now as e dey buy di rights to music from artists like Nile Rodgers, Blondie, Barry Manilow, Chrissie Hynde and Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham. Shakira na one of di most successful singer - songwriters of di last 25 years. Since she release her first album for 1991, at di age of 13, she don sell more dan 80 million records, don win three Grammy Awards and 12 Latin Grammy Awards. Over 13 million fans buy her first English-language album, Laundry Service for 2001. Her hit singles wey include Whenever, Wherever, Underneath Your Clothes, Hips Don't Lie and the 2010 Fifa World Cup song Waka Waka (This Time For Africa), top di charts for 15 kontris. Di star most recent album, El Dorado, dey certified diamond for di US. She be one of di only three female artists to get two videos wey pass two billion views on YouTube. And her latest single, Girl Like Me, bin catch fire for one viral dance craze on Tik Tok. Last year, she show for di Super Bowl half-time show alongside Jennifer Lopez, wey give her song catalogue anoda ginger and increase di value to investors. ""She be superb creator wey don create big success in streaming her songs pass most of her colleagues,"" Mercuriadis tok inside statement. ""Dis na di result of her being a determined force of nature and don write songs wey di world like well-well."" Financial security na di obvious reason. Rather dan to dey gamble say dia songs go continue earn royalties, for di next 25 years, singers like Shakira get big money up-front. Wetin Hipgnosis dey tell musicians na say dem no be traditional publisher, wey go dey exploit di rights of a composition, but dem be ""song management company"" wey go ensure legacy of artist by careful stewardship of dia music. After dem buy 50% take in Neil Young catalogue, for example, Mercuriadis promise say di singer classic track Heart of Gold no go ever dey burger commercial. Hipgnosis no be di only company for di game. Earlier dis week, investment company KKR (Kohlberg Kravis Roberts) buy di rights to 500 songs wey Ryan Tedder - write including tracks like Ed Sheeran's Happier, Camila Cabello's Into It and di Jonas Brothers' Sucker. Bob Dylan recently hand over im 600-song back catalogue to Universal Music, in a deal wey according to report worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And the US-based Primary Wave don dey buy up di rights to music by Stevie Nicks, Leon Russell, Leo Sayer and soft-rock duo Air Supply. For Shakira, another reason wey she fit dey sell fit be di €14.5m (£13m) tax bill Spanish goment recently sama her. For inside statement, di Colombian say Hipgnosis go be ""great home"" for her music, and to her love for songwriting. ""Being a songwriter na accomplishment wey I consider equal to and perhaps even greater dan being a singer and an artist, "" she tok. ""At eight years old - long before I begin sing - I dey write songs to make sense of di world. Each song na a reflection of di person I be dat time wen I write am, but once one song don come out for di world, E no belong to only me again but to pipo wey dey appreciate am as well. ""I dey humbled say song writing don give me di privilege of communicating wit others, of being a part of something wey dey bigger pass me."""	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/world-55650261

I for don  learn so much more inside 18 months for di real world. ""My advice to Jin be to just wait im time and pray say e pass quickly."" But Heo, from di logistics team, get better memories. Initially e bin say e questioned, like many men for dia 20s, why im suppose dey there, but e end up to learn some valuable lessons. ""For school, I bin don only mix wih pipo from di same background, but inside di army, everyone dey so different. I realise how much bigger and more diverse di world be."" Im advice for Jin be to enjoy dis experience. ""As one top star, e for no get much opportunity to meet normal pipo. Dis go be good for am, I think.""

Di stranded ship wey im name na Ever Given dey stop di movement of at least $9.6bn (£7bn) of goods each day, according to shipping data. Dis dey work out at $400m an hour in trade along di waterway wey be important passage way between east and west. Data from shipping expert Lloyd List put di value of di canal westbound traffic for roughly $5.1bn a day, and eastbound daily traffic at around $4.5bn. Despite efforts to free di ship, expert's tok say e go take weeks to remove am. Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, di technical manager of di ship, tok say another attempt on Friday to re-float di cargo vessel no dey successful. A specialized suction dredger wey fit shift 2,000 cubic meters of material every hour now dey on site, and ""dem dey also make arrangements for high-capacity pumps to reduce di water levels wey dey inside di forward empty space of di ship and di bow thruster room,""  di firm tok on Friday. Bernhard Schulte add say two additional tugboats go arrive by Sunday to help di float operation to move di giant ship. About 12% of global trade dey pass through di 193km (120-mile) canal, wey connect di Mediterranean Sea to di Red Sea and e provide di shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. Di Ever Given ship wey Taiwanese company Evergreen Marine dey operate big, di length na like four football pitches and na one of di world biggest container vessels. Di 200,000-tonne ship dey capable of carrying 20,000 containers. Di way e take hook dey affect oda ships wey dey try pass through di Suez Canal. Di canal wey separate Africa from di Middle East and Asia, na one of di busiest trade routes for di world. According to Lloyd List tracking data, more than 160 vessels dey wait at either end of di canal. Dem include 41 bulk carriers and 24 crude tankers. Join wit oil, di sea traffic na largely consumer products like clothing, furniture, manufacturing components and car parts. BIMCO, one international shipping association, say di delays go continue to grow and e go affect supplies. In addition to delaying thousands of containers loaded wit consumer items, di stranded ship don also tie up empty containers wey dem suppose export. Efforts don continue to move di Ever Given, di 400m-long (1,300ft) container ship wey block di Suez Canal for Egypt since Tuesday. Dredgers don clear sand and mud away from di bow of di vessel, and dem don use tugboats and di ship winches to try move am. On Thursday, di owner of di giant container ship Japanese firm Shoei Kinsen, bin tok sorry for all di kasala di blockage don cause for oda vessels wey wan pass through di canal. Dem say dem dey try all dia best wit local authorities and di vessel operators, to find solution to di problem, but warn say e go dey very hard. If di delays dey short, most companies no go mind wait one exra day. But salvage officials say di congestion fit last for days or even weeks, wey go really affect global supply chains wey don already suffer sake of Covid-19 pandemic. Some companies go dey reason to fly replacement merchandise for higher value products, or use trains transport dem. Two major shipping companies, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, say dem dey find oda options to avoid Suez Canal. Egypt Suez Canal Authority (SCA) say dem dey do everything for dia power to refloat di ship wit tug boats, dredgers and heavy earth-moving equipment. Kitack Lim, secretary general of di international Maritime Organisation, say: "" I dey aware of di implications of di temporary closure of di canal, and I dey ask for patience from stakeholders across di supply chain as everyone works to ensure that di ship, di crew, cargo and di environment go remain protected."""	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-56541085

politics	"""Trump debate Biden"": US presidential debate 2020 claims by Donald Trump, Joe Biden for Cleveland na true? Reality Check find out"	"America President Donald Trump 2020 re-election campaign team don claim say na Oga Trump dey lead di first presidential debate between him and im m Democratic Challenger Joe Biden. Campaign manager, Bill Stepien say Trump turn in di greatest debate performance for presidential history. But tori be say some viewers consider Tuesday night Cleveland presidential debate as one of di most disorganised White House debates in years. Di 90 minutes debate hot as di candidates no gree on top any mata, from di state of di economy go di way goment take handle di coronavirus pandemic. Reality Check pick some of di things dem claim wen Trump debate Biden and fact check am whether di claim na true. Trump: ""We build di greatest economy for history"" Verdict: He dey wrong: E get time for US history wen di economy dey stronger. President Trump claim say before di coronavirus outbreak, im goment build di greatest economy for di history of America. He say for history, di kontri economy grow well, record low unemployment and remove millions of Americans comot from poverty. Na true say di economy dey do well was doing well before di pandemic - continuity of wetin former President Obama administration start - but e get time wen e dey stronger.er. The economy under Trump in six charts Verdict: E dey correct small. But if dem check coronavirus deaths per capita, e get some kontries where dia case worse pass US. Oga Biden criticise President Trump for di way e take manage and respond to coronavirus. ""In fact we get 4% of di world population, 20% pipo don die,"" di former vice-president tok. According to di figures, he dey right. US population na around 328 million, wey be just over 4% of di 7.7 billion population of di world. 205,942 pipo don die sake of coronavirus deaths for di US, according to di latest John Hopkins University data. Di total number of deaths recorded worldwide na 1,004,808. If we calculate am like dis, America get about 20% of Covid-19 deaths worldwide, although di way kontris take dey record dia figures dey different. Fact check of wetin di presidential candidates claim Verdict: Studies neva discover or show evidence of plenty magomago, although very small cases dey. President Trump tok say increase in postal ballots go cause di kain magomago wey pipo neva see before. Sake of coronavirus pandemic, plenty US voters go use postal voting vote for dis year election. Di president don sama warning plenty times say dis method no pure. Small cases of magomago dey reported including recent examples for North Carolina and New Jersey. For September, di US Department of Justice release  statement about one incident wey happun for Pennsylvania in where ""nine military ballots waste"" and said seven of them ""na vote in favour of di presidential candidate Donald Trump"". But even wit all di cases, plenty studies no show evidence of any widespread fraud. Di rate of voting fraud overall for di US dey between 0.00004% and 0.0009%, according to one 2017 study by di Brennan Center for Justice. Verdict: No ogbonge answer to dis. Di candidates quanta over how many pipo for di US get pre-existing medical conditions, wey no go make some Americans dey covered by private medical insurers. Oga Biden about 100 million pipo getpre-existing conditions, but President Trump say di number dey ""totally wrong"". So how many dey? No ogbonge answer to dis. According to di US goment Department of Health and Human Services, between 50 and 129 million Americans wey neva old get some type of pre-existing health condition. Other organisations get different estimates. The Center for American Progress believe say e dey higher, at 135 million pipo under age 65. Verdict: ""Very, Very low chance"" na im dey if any approved vaccine go dey ready by di end of October,  di chief scientific adviser to di US vaccine programme tok. President Trump for di debate tok say vaccine go ready for US in some weeks. However, Dr Moncef Slaoui, di chief scientific adviser to di US vaccine programme, say di chances say approved vaccine go ready before di end of October dey slim. Meanwhile, Dr Anthony Fauci, di kontri top infectious disease expert, bin predict say America go know if dem get safe and effective vaccine by November or December dis year. He tell Senate committee hearing dis month say Americans go get enough vaccines by April. Verdict: Dis one no correct, according to di figures. Democratic candidate Joe Biden tok say even before Covid-19, ""manufacturing go down"". Di pandemic no get impact on dis sector. As of August, manufacturing jobs for America no reach 237,000 wen Trump take over office for 2017. But before di pandemic, President Trump don add almost half a million manufacturing jobs during im first three years in office. Verdict: xxxx Normal copy Verdict: Di average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell slightly bin fall for di year to August 2019, but e rise again. Oga Biden claim say President Trump ''no reduce di price of drug for anyone"". But according to di Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI)- wey dey measure di cost of household items for America - di average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell by 0.3% for di year to August 2019. Dis na di first time price go reduce over a 12-month period since 1973. While average drug prices rise by 1.5% over di following year, under President Trump di average rises bin dey lower pass wen President Obama dey office. The CPI no be di most reliable way to measure drug prices, as e most of di time include drugs pipo dey use well-well, and dem dey cheap. It is less likely to include newer or less-prescribed drugs, wey dey more expensive and get higher price increases.

sports	Premier League: BBC Sport pundits predicts who go win & finish top four	Defending champions Manchester City dey go for hat-trick of titles dis season - but who fit stop dem from winning three in a row? Dat na di next target for City boss Pep Guardiola, im don already achieve di feat for Spain (Barcelona, 2008-11) and Germany (Bayern Munich, 2013-16) e win a total of four league titles in six seasons at City. Liverpool na City closest rivals last season, dem finish only one point behind, but di koko now na if odas fit challenge dem dis time around? Dis na start of a new era for Manchester United under Erik ten Hag but, afta dem finish sixth last season, di big question na say if dem fit return to top four, or sustain a serious title bid for the first time since di last time dem become champions for 2013? What about Chelsea chances to challenge for di title afta di wahala di club get off di pitch for 2021-22? And Tottenham chances to build on dia fourth-place finish? Then Arsenal to get back into the Champions League places for di first time since 2016? Or odas teams fit enta dis mix too? We ask BBC TV and radio pundits to pick dia top four, and explain dia selections. Dis predictions na onto how each squad dey as at Thursday, 4 August, wit more than three weeks to go until transfer window close at di end of August. Na six teams feature for di forecasted top fours, but na only Manchester City and Liverpool feature for all 23. In terms of who go win am, Manchester City na di favourites wit 13 votes. while Liverpool get di oda 10. (we use di  system of 4 pts for 1st place, 3 pts for 2nd, 2 pts for 3rd and 1 pt for 4th) Martin Keown: Dis season go different from wetin we don experience before . E go dey in two halves. Jermaine Jenas: A good start dey more important dis season because we no know yet how di World Cup go affect di players wey go, or di ones wey no go. Stephen Warnock: E dey very hard to call di title race dis year. Imagine say you dey top and dey cruise at di start of November -dat normally na di start of your title charge - but dis time you fit see players pick up injury or lose form for Qatar and by di time you restart di season you don lose all your momentum. Nedum Onuoha: You want your players to stay sharp, but not too tired. Selfishly, I  imagine say most club managers go prefer for dia players to come back afta di group stage so dem fit get two or three weeks to prepare for di rest of di season. Glenn Murray: E fit hinder City twice? Dem dey start slow sometimes for August, so e fit happun again for December. I don't see it though. Everyone know say dis break go happen and dem go dey ready for am, especially di top teams. Ashley Williams: Whoever handle dis di best go be a big factor for di title race, but di top two go into it wit so much detail about everything and dem dey normally get am right. Micah Richards: E go dey very tight wit Liverpool yet again, but I just feel say Erling Haaland and also Julian Alvarez fit be di difference for City. Nedum Onuoha: Both players dey very good, but I feel say dis year maybe dey come too soon for dem. Di difference between City and Liverpool dey very small. Jermaine Jenas: Wit Fernandinho leaving, dem don lose dia leader for dressing room and, overall, few uncertainties dey wit City than Liverpool. City get  a lot of resting on players wey neva do am for dem yet and historically we know say e go take a while to fit into dia team. Haaland and Alvarez gats come in and blend in straight away, wit Raheem Sterling leaving, Jack Grealish gatz  produce more dis season. Michael Brown: City don already make some great signings and dem want get  a left-back in too. With their strength in depth, dem suppose strong pass Liverpool. Glenn Murray: I dey excited to see Haaland, of course. But I no know how e go  work wit di way City dey play and dey pin teams in - especially against lesser sides for  Etihad. I don dey for those games and sometimes you go get got 10 opposition players around dia own area. No space at all and im no go don face that problem before. City no dey put di ball inside di box, so wetin im go do? Ashley Williams: E go take City time to figure out how im go fit in, but e go come. Whoever dem put down di middle last year bin get plenty chances, so di same go happen for Haaland, although e go dey patient because di ball no go come to am as quickly as im dey used to. Izzy Christiansen: Haaland go give dem a more direct way of playing, e mean say dem go dey able to kill games off quicker. Jonathan Woodgate: City bin win last year without a striker and now dem get Haaland, wey be world class. e sure for dem - dem don improve, so dem go win am again. Jonathan Woodgate: Liverpool go miss Sadio Mane badly because im bring so much to di team wit im closing down as well as im goals. Without im, I no see how di title race go dey close as e bin dey last season - I feel say City go win di league by a much wider margin. Martin Keown: Liverpool na di best pressers for world football, and Mane na best , so for dem to dey better without am e go hard for me to take on board. For City to dey better wit a proper centre-forward, I go accept. Dem no feed Haaland di ball for Community Shield, but dem get intelligent players and dem go adapt. Jermaine Jenas: I bin dey think about Mane going and how big di loss be - dem don lose one of di best players for Premier League. But it freshens dia team up and dem no get anything to worry about squad-wise. I dey see Liverpool younger players like Harvey Elliott and Curtis Jones to contribute a lot more dis season, and dem get di best defence for di league. Leon Osman: Losing Mane fit dey big, but im replacement fit dey bigger - we just no know yet. Whatever happens wit Darwin Nunez, a front three of Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah go dey difficult to stop, but I still see dem falling short of City. Matt Upson: Like City, Liverpool get new striker wit Nunez, but dem get a bit more clarity wit dia system. Dem dey use to playing di ball forward quickly, wey suit a centre-forward like him and dem dey more direct in di way dem dey cross, di balls ova di top and down di flanks. Danny Murphy: I expect Haaland to settle quick pass Nunez, only because e get more experience, but dat probably dey a little bit unfair on Nunez because straight away im dey look like a real threat and like player wey get plenty energy. Dem dey go toe to toe wit City again. Stephen Warnock: You only need to watch di quality and intensity on show for di Community Shield to see how good City and Liverpool dey - and why no-one go dey close to them again dis season. E dey between those two again and di big thing for me na how much City go miss Sterling and di influence and impact im get. E dey always pop up wit key goals and assists and dem for no win di last game of di season - or di title - if not for him. Jermaine Jenas: As good as Liverpool season be last time, dem bin suffer  a lot of pain as well towards di end and dat kind of stuff go ginger you up for di new season. We see am happen afta dem miss out to City in 2018-19 and dem come back flying. This time, I think those memories of missing out on di title and losing di Champions League final dey di mind of these players as well. Dat hunger fit be di thing wey go get dem over di line. Glenn Murray: We don already see Tottenham progress since Antonio Conte take charge for November and you know say im go make sure say dem work hard again. Dia firepower dey almost unmatchable and im style of play dey very structured - dem no go concede many goals. Pat Nevin: If anyone dey capable of breaking out of di pack na Spurs because of how well dem buy players. Michael Brown: Di squad Spurs get now dey very good. Di only question I get n about dia three centre-backs and whether dem dey strong enough defensively ova di course of di season. Leon Osman: Dem fit be di dark horses dis year if dem sort out dia defensive issues. Di addition of Richarlison to dia attack make dem more balanced side. Someone oda than Son Heung-min to run in behind make dem rival any attacking team for di league. Add for di leadership of Conte and dem fit make a fist of am - if dem fit figure out a way not to be so 'Spursy'. Sue Smith: Dem buy a lot of strong and aggressive players so dem go dey tough dis season. Dem go dey hard to beat. Jermaine Jenas: Conte signings don elevate dis team to another level.e depend on dem if dem fit find di performances and di rhythm dem bin get last year, but I dey predict a reasonably comfortable third-placed finish for Spurs. Di only reason I dey put them on di title race na because, unlike City and Liverpool, I no sure if dem fit win 14 or so games in a row. Dem fit stay unbeaten for dat long, but I no see dem go on a run wia dem dey win every match Matt Upson: Chelsea dey  rebuild wit change of ownership and lot of movement for dia squad. A bit of uncertainty dey around dem. Martin Keown: Last season top four go take some shifting, but potentially Chelsea look di most likely to fall out of sake of di players wey don comot . Antonio Rudiger na massive loss for back. Stephen Warnock: Chelsea need a striker and dat na di reason dem no dey my top four. Pat Nevin: For Chelsea to get good season, dem need three things to happen: Kai Havertz need to play well and their full-backs gatz stay fit - Reece James and Ben Chilwell bin dey out for long periods last season and dem bin miss dem badly because dat na where plenty of dia creativity dey come from. The third thing na say dem   need to sign another major centre-back to go with Kalidou Koulibaly. Na wetin dem dey try do, but if dem no get one, dem no go fit compete. Izzy Christiansen: With Thomas Tuchel in charge, I see Chelsea dey struggle wit dia form. Sterling na smart signing e go give dem sometin different. Danny Murphy: Dem get some new faces and e go take a while to settle but I be big fan of Tuchel and I feel say im be very intelligent manager. I still tink dia squad dey full of quality players and I no think dem go get di same bad spell like last season, so I feel say dem go do beta dis time. Dem sign some good players, I expect dem to sign more. Jermaine Jenas: E hard to go against Chelsea finishing for di top four. but if dem bring in Frenkie de Jong from Barcelona as well as Marc Cucurella, things go start to look very different. Whoever come in, dem go get wetin dem need for di transfer market and Tuchel go make dem play di way im want. Dion Dublin: E bin dey very close to call between dem and Tottenham for fourth, I don speak to di new United manager, things go dey very different there. Dem go come good soon. Nedum Onuoha: United basically fall apart for di second half of last season, but e dey look like dem dey in di right direction now  wey Ten Hag dey in charge. Jermaine Jenas: United dey depend on players wey don dey quiet for dem so far, players like Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford - wey bin no dey form last season  - but you gtaz  realise say dem bin no dey organised for most of last season. Dem bin no get set way of playing, but Ten Hag and im assistant Steve McClaren go change am and make sure each player know wetin dia job be. When footballers get dat clarity, good things go start to happun. Dem go dey in the mix for fourth but, compared to everyone else, I no think  say dia squad dey good enough to make am Glenn Murray: I dey expect improvement from United, but dem still dey far from di Champions League places. Chris Sutton: Na bigger job to get dem into di top four than for oda team going for those places. Jermaine Beckford: Dem go dey extremely fortunate to make a European spot through di Europa League. Jonathan Woodgate: E go dey difficult for Ten Hag. Di Cristiano Ronaldo situation dey  go on one side and e go affect di squad. E no go dey on dia pre-season tour and e no go dey 100% fit for di start of di season. Will Ronaldo settle to sidon for  bench? I no think so… Leon Osman: United get alot of ground to make up, but Ten Hag fit be di man to do am. Ronaldo fit dey key - or e fit leave. Ten Hag need to decide  quickly as im need a united camp without distractions. Stephen Warnock: If United keep Ronaldo, I feel say dem go struggle. E go just cause problems because I no think e go play for Ten Hag system. Dia top-four chances dey hang on dat. Jermaine Jenas: Dis no be Ronaldo for di peak of im powers, like wen im bin win di Champions League wit United for 2008 then im bin dey indispensable and get so much influence on di team. But dis Ronaldo dey vital in terms of im goal contribution to United. If dem lose di 24 goals im bin score for them last season, who go score them? Nobody else dey  that team wey I go back to reach 20 goals on dia own, so dat go be my biggest concern if im go. Jermaine Beckford: Arsenal just look like dem get a really good pre-season and look like dem dey happy and energised, wey dey vital. Matt Upson: I consider West Ham as well, and whether dem fit progress again afta last season, but I go for Arsenal to finish fourth because dem don dey rebuild for much longer. Ashley Williams: Arsenal  dey look  stronger and stronger. Yes a team like Aston Villa fit hit a golden patch and challenge and I think Everton fit do well dis season too - Always one team go surprise everyone - but  Gunners na di most likely team to break into di top four. Jonathan Woodgate: I love di players Arsenal buy and dem go dey close to di top four again dis season. I no see West Ham doing as well dis time and although pipo fit talk about Newcastle if dem start well, I feel say dem go make Europa League - dat go be successful season for dem. Michael Brown: Arsenal dey good form and wit dia new signings. I no think dia squad dey strong as di teams wey bin finish above dem dis time, but dem fit surprise everyone dis season. Stephen Warnock: I be huge fan of Gabriel Jesus. Im fit be di signing of di season. Nedum Onuoha: Jesus arrive wit a point to prove because im bin dey di background a bit for City. Im be di main man now and I expect am to do very well. If im fit lead di line and pass on di experience of wetin e take to dey  successful for Premier League, den Arsenal go dey very competitive dis year. Leon Osman: Signing Jesus fit be di game-changer for dem. A guy wey go do well at di top of dat young developing team. But dat na di issue - dem still dey grow and I no dey sure if dem don ripe yet. Jermaine Jenas: Dem look like a team wey dey go in di right direction, but dem still neva convince me. I feel like dem go start well. A lot of pipo dey concerned about dia first game for Crystal Palace and I feel say dem go win, but I no dey sure if dem get enough to sustain di momentum for di season? Martin Keown: I dey worried say di pre-season bin go too well  for Arsenal. If Arsenal lose dat first game, all of dia good work for preseason don go.	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/sport-62319132

Dis na di situation wey don force goment to introduce food and fuel subsidies. Di rise in commodity prices don make am difficult for Kenyans to continue dia lives as usual. For example, two-kilogram packet of corn flour don reach two dollars from 1.2 dollars e dey in di past three months. Dat na 67% increase. Dis move by goment to set subsidies and allow corn meal traders to import corn from neighbouring countries no still dey successful even as dem reduce di price of these products to one dollar for a two-kilogram bag.

Corruption na often one of di biggest problems for Kenya. Kenya head of public service, Joseph Kinyua, estimate say dem dey lose one-third of di national annual budget to corruption, while accounting firm KPMG LLP say abuses and crime plus bribery and bid rigging dey consume about 10% of a national income of $95 billion annually.

BBC Africa correspondent Catherine Byaruhanga take a look at di challenger. Few weeks before di general election and wetin fit be di biggest day of Bobi Wine life as  he bring im presidential campaign to im family ancestral home. Di 38-year-old pop star, wey im real name na Robert Kyagulanyi, gain im popularity for di informal settlements of di capital, Kampala, but even in Kanoni, one sleepy rural town for central Uganda, dem dey support am. Hundreds of young pipo, mostly men dressed in red, seem to comot from di bushes and gardens and surround im motorcade. Bobi Wine, wey dem dey also call ""ghetto president"", climb through di sunroof of im white Toyota Landcruiser and wave at di crowds - and dey ansa. For one unlikely dressing move for a presidential candidate, he don start dey wear bullet-proof vest and protective helmet. For December, dem shoot one bullet through im car windscreen narrowly missing one passenger. Bobi Wine say im think say im life dey in danger. For Kanoni, as e don happun many times during campaign , he don run into police and military blockade- dem fire teargas and bullets- Authorities say dem dey try find and disperse crowds and enforce Covid-19 guidelines. But Bobi Wine believed dis na yet anoda sign of intimidation. He don consistently dey tok say dis no go happun as im feel say im be head of a mass movement. ""Pipo no just dey follow me. Pipo dey follow di ideal wey I represent,"" he tell BBC in 2019. ""I no start am and I no go end am. I be just one of di millions and millions of Ugandans wey want beta"" Di manifesto of im National Unity Platform (NUP) party dey geared towards basic needs like improving access to healthcare, education, clean water and justice. All of dis, di NUP tok say dem fit only do am, if dem remove President Museveni from power. Ova di last two decades Bobi Wine musical output don dey been filled wit songs about dis issues and e don inspire one ogbonge following. Twenty-three-year-old law student Marion Kirabo dey campaign to be local councillor and she be one of im supporters. ""Even before im political life he be pesin wey di the youth fit identify wit,"" she tok. ""Especially through im music, you fit clearly see say he understood di social issues wey young pipo dey face, especially young pipo wey come from ghetto."" Wen President Museveni came to power for 1986, Bobi Wine dey just about to turn four, and e dey live for Kanoni. Central Uganda don be di battleground of di bush war wey bring Oga Museveni rebel National Resistance Army, and im political wing, di National Resistance Movement (NRM), to power. Bobi Wine grandpapa, Yozefu Walakira, dey part of one different rebel contingent but from time to time during di conflict wey Oga Museveni host for im house. Walakira die during di civil war afta im wunjure wen dem bomb im house - an attack wey also kill three family members. Bobi Wine family later moved to Kampala, im mama Margaret Nalunkuuma, wey be nurse, na di main breadwinner and she buy land for di Kamwokya slum wia di musician live and build im world-famous recording studio. Some of im primary and secondary schools always dey within walking distance from Kamwokya. As a teenager he discover im passion for di arts, but wen he first attend di prestigious Makerere University he start to dey study for social sciences degree. After one semester he switch courses and begin music, dance and drama, wia im get diploma from di university for 2003. For 2017, di reggae star turn im hand to politics as he see am as di logical next step. ""You know, all through my musical career,  I don dey sing about di challenges wey pipo dey go through,"" he tell BBC. ""So e look like say I don dey campaign all my musical career."" Im song Tuliyambala Engule (We Shall Wear di Victor's Crown) don become one of di campaign unofficial anthems. He win by-election to become MP for Kyaddondo-East, one constituency to di north of di capital and even though an independent he align himself with di opposition. for one series of by-elections he campaign for candidates wey defeat hopefuls from di NRM. E no get any sound of regret for Bobi Wine voice wen he reflect on im rival career inside one BBC interview for 2019. ""Why dat kain prized revolutionary decide to become one of di world's most despised dictators?"" he ask. ""But na also lesson to many of us, as we sabi say we dey tok wetin President Museveni dey tok wen e dey like us. And also to remember say na only di idea of building strong institutions fit save us from ourselves."" Di comparison between a younger Oga Museveni - wey dey charismatic, energetic and inspiring - wit today's Bobi Wine dey hard to escape. Di rebel commander be just 41 years old wen he seize power, dey promise Ugandans security, stronger economy and beta future. Some dey wonder whether im new challenger full of idealism and populist rhetoric fit make di same mistakes. Activist Siperia Mollie Saasirabo, 24, wey tok say she don dey ""political exile"" for Kenya, no to believe in Bobi Wine. For 2019, she become di face of student protests ova increase in school fees for Makerere University. For dat, dem abduct, beat and leave her barely conscious. At di end of dat year, she briefly join Bobi Wine party but later comot as she see say di party no get solid ideaology. ""Dem ask am about im economic system wen he boecome president,"" she tok, referring to one July 2020 interview Bobi Wine give to one local radio station. ""Dem ask if im dey on di left or right of di ideological setting, and im ansa na say im no dey for either right or di left and im go just use wetin go works and dis no make sense for me."" Apart from di large crowds wey gada to support him, like di one for Kanoni, e dey hard to tell how truly popular im dey and whether di cheers go turn to votes. Data on registered voters and dia voting patterns dey very limited. For dis context e get some wey don already dey question di validity of di vote. Bobi Wine, however, don encourage pipo to cast dia ballots and say make voters dey sure say rigging for polling stations no happun."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-55614853

politics	Biden tell Japan say e ready to use force defend Taiwan	"U.S. President Joe Biden say on Monday say im ready to use force to defend Taiwan. Biden tok dis one as part of series of critical comments about China, during im visit to Japan. Na im first trip to Japan since im enta office and no so Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stand dia dey look. But one of im aide say di comment no mean say U.S. policy on di self-ruled island don change. Di US president comment appear to dey different from existing U.S. policy of so-called strategic ambiguity on Taiwan. China consider di democratic island as dia territory, part of ""one China"". And Beijing say na di most sensitive and important issue for dia relationship wit di United States. Wen one reporter ask Biden if  United States go defend Taiwan if dem attack am, di president answer: ""Yes."" ""Dat na di commitment wey we make,"" Joe Biden say, during one joint news conference wit di Japanese leader. ""We agree wit one-China policy. We don sign am plus all di intended agreements wey dem make inside. ""But di idea say, dem fit to take am by force, just take am by force, no just dey, no just dey appropriate."" Im add say im dey expect say dat kain tin no go happun or dey attempted. Following Biden comments, one White House official say e no get any change for policy towards Taiwan. Di president national security aides shift for dia seats and bend dia heads, dey study Biden closely as im respond to di question on Taiwan. Plenti bin look down as im make wetin resemble not so clear commitment to Taiwan defence. Biden make similar comment about defending Taiwan for October. During dat time, one White House tok tok pesin say Biden bin no dey announce any change in U.S. policy. And one analyst refer to di comment as ""gaffe"" or blunder. United States bin don agree long ago say na one China, including Taiwan. But it e don adopt im ""strategic ambiguity"" on di question of weda e go involve imsef in military conflict over di island. Di tok dey come as Biden make tough comments about China increasingly self-confident for di region. Di president say im hope say Russia President Vladimir Putin go pay price for im invasion of Ukraine in part to show China wetin e go face if e invade Taiwan. Di comments dey likely to both provoke Beijing and overshadow di koko of Biden Japan visit, wey be to achieve one Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.

Na wia Cristiano Ronaldo dey expected to make im second debut for Manchester United. Dia game against Newcastle na 15:00 BST dat na 3pm West African time. ""I no think say Ronaldo go  start,"" na so BBC football expert Mark Lawrenson. ""But im go definitely play some part - and, no, I no go dey surprised at all if im score."" See Lawrenson Premier League predictions for match week four. Dis week im guest na singer and guitarist Justin Young from indie rock band The Vaccines, wey im new album Back In Love City go dey out on Friday. Justin na United fan wey dey excited for di return of Ronaldo, but say im no dey sure of wetin to expect from di Reds dis season. ""Once again we dey start di season wit wetin if you look for paper, na correct team - maybe even better wit di return of CR7,"" Im tell BBC Sport. LAWRO PREDICTIONS Games go kick off at 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated SATURDAY Tottenham neva do anything spectacular so far but dem don do really well to win every Premier League game 1-0 - especially because I feel say dia defence na weak link. I'd still fancy Spurs to win dis one and continue their 100% winning start, even though Son no dey fit, but I no dey to worried about Crystal Palace wait for dia first league win under Patrick Vieira. Lawro prediction: 0-1 Justin prediction: Dis game go tough for Palace. Dem no dey look great, but Spurs good. 0-3 Arsenal results so far dey very bad so far but surely dem go get something out of dis bottom-of-di-table clash. We know say Norwich go fight hard dis season to avoid relegation. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Justin prediction: Arsenal get better players pass Norwich have, but as tins be now e no look good. Norwich feel say dem fit get something dia. 1-1 Na so far, so good for Brentford wey still dey unbeaten afta three league games. Brighton go expect a noisy atmosphere like di one wey we saw when di Bees beat Arsenal for di first game of di season because di home fans go just dey enjoy dia self. Justin's prediction: Brentford na classic newly promoted team wit plenty ginger - , so I dey support di Bees here. 1-0 As I dey tok, Manchester City still dey hope say dem go dey allowed to play Brazil duo Ederson and Gabriel Jesus but I still fancy them here without those two, even though e go mean say third-choice keeper Scott Carson go step in because Zack Steffen dey also unavailable. Leicester get a  bit of history against Pep Guardiola' Manchester City, including beating them for  last month Community Shield, but di Foxes go face a different animal dis time. Lawro prediction: 1-2 Justin' prediction: I no want to write Leicester off, but Manchester City dey look pretty strong. 1-2 Newcastle badly need a win, but Old Trafford, on di day wey Ronaldo dey return, no be di place or time to get am. Lawro prediction: 3-0 Justin prediction: Based on Ronaldo history and how im dey always marks every occasion to do something special, I dey expect a goal from am and a win for Manchester United, based on say Newcastle no dey form right now. 3-0 Southampton na another team without a victory so far but I feel say their performances  better pass their results for their first three games. West Ham, meanwhile, don win two out of three and go maintain dia 100% record if to say dem no allow dia lead slip twice for home against Crystal Palace before di international break. Lawro's prediction: 2-1 Justin's prediction:  1-0 Watford don lose their past two games afta dem starting their season with a win ova Aston Villa and I no dey see that run ending dia weekend. Wolves dey without a point or even a goal so far but dem don create plenty chances and surely that go soon change , whether Mexican striker Raul Jimenez dey allowed to play or not. Lawro's prediction: 1-2 Justin's prediction: Dis one dey hard to call. 2-2 I bin dey impressed by Chelsea for dia draw wit Liverpool before di international break - Dem bin play well wen dem bin get  11 men and dem still do well when dem go down to 10. Aston Villa no go lack energy or effort but di Blues go dey too strong for them. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Justinprediction: Chelsea go win dis one. 3-1 Leeds form no too solid  like dat so far dis season, but I feel say dem go struggle, to bounce back I dey go wit Liverpool. Di  Reds go plenty of opportunities in front of goal. Lawro prediction: 1-2 Justin prediction: Dis go be good, open game but Liverpool suppose win am. 0-2 Everton start to di season dey good  under Rafa Benitez and I dey expect dem to continue here. Burnley go make life difficult for them, of course - but the Toffees get enough quality to break them down. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Justin prediction: 1-1 How to watch di matches?

sports	Togo national football team attack: Survivors remember machine gun ambush, 10 years afta	"On 8 January 2010, di Africa Cup of Nations for Angola bin only remain few days before e start. I bin dey di province of Cabinda, dey prepare to cover Group B for di BBC World Service, and bin also dey in charge of handing ova di BBC African Footballer of the Year trophy to di newly-crowned winner, Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba. As di day waka dey go, unconfam reports of shooting, wey involve Togo national team, start to fly evriwia. Di detail bin no clear, but e clear say sometin serious don happun. How serious di tin be show wen I meet di squad as dem dey return to dia hotel for Cabinda city. I ask to speak to someone, dem immediately tell me say di team tok-tok pesin na dia best-known player - wey be Manchester City star Emmanuel Adebayor. Wen e siddon to tok, e give shocking details of di attack wey kill two members of di Togo delegation and result in life changing injuries to some odas. 10 years afta, dis na di tori from team members wey make global headlines and wetin happun afta. Togo squad bin dey in good spirits days before di 2010 Nations Cup. Dem just qualify back for di tournament afta dem miss out for 2008 and bin dey prepare to take on group wey feature some of di biggest names for African football - Drogba Ivory Coast and Michael Essien Ghana bin dey di same group. Before di tournament, Togo decide to camp for Pointe Noir for Republic of Congo, just over 100km from wia dem go play dia group games for Angola city of Cabinda. Cabinda dey separate from di rest of Angola, and instead of di Togo suad to fly from wia dem dey to di capital Luanda and den fly back north again, dem choose to drive. Dis decision later end with bad result. Afta di suqad relax in di evening, di night before - dem travel go di border. Players bin just dey laugh and joking amongst demselves for di bus. Angola security forces join dem for di border and suppose escort dem through di forest - wey be di base of one groups wey dey call for independence from Angola - to Cabinda city. Di squad no pay much attention to dia arrival.  Dem no know say very soon dem go begin fight for di lives of everyone inside di Togo team bus. Di small convoy move from di border, to di road through di forest. Looking back 10 years, midfielder Junior Senaya recall di journey, and di moment everitin change. ""All of us bin dey enjoy, afta we don cross di border. Some of us bin dey busy dey listen to music. I remember afta 15 minutes wey we don dey drive we hear gunshot for di forest - we all laugh, make joke. Den serious shooting start."" Di first casualty happen before anybody even know wetin dey go on. Senaya remember Togo media officer, Stanislas Ocloo, bin stand to video dia arrival for Angola at di moment of di attack. Dem shoot kill am. Anoda player wey remember clearly those crazy moments na goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale. Im life change for just few seconds, as e realise say dem don shoot am too. ""I hear di sound of di machine gun,"" Im tok, ""and for dat very moment I bin want move go hide, e bin dey as if dem nail me to chair. ""Dat na wen I see myself - both my belle and my back begin bleed. Dat na wen I begin panic. I say: 'Dem don hit me, help me, help me, I want see my daughter, my son. I no wan die here.'"" Even as im dey handle e own injuries, and fear, Obilale bin dey able to remember and tok wetin happun dat day. Im remember as assistant coach Amelete Abalo shout say dem don shoot am - di 54-year-na one of di pipo wey die for di attack. E remember one team-mate wey get military training call for weapon, so dat e go fit fight back. Di team bin no dey able to escape from di shooting because di bus driver - Mario Adjoua - don also wunjure for di start of di attack. Di convoy by-force stop, and serious firefight brake out between di attackers and di security forces. Memories of how long e last dey different, but everyone agree say na at least 30 minutes e last. Adebayor tok about how serious di longest half hour of e life dey. ""No be like say one or two guys shoot one or two times on our bus,"" Adebayor tell me afta im don dey safe place for di team hotel few hours afta di attack. ""We don dey di middle of dat for 30 minutes or even more. Our bus bin don stop and pipo bin don dey shoot our bus for 30 minutes. Can you imagine? Honestly na one of di worst experiences I don eva get for my life. ""Without di security den I no go dey here dey tok you. Maybe na my dead body you fit dey tok to."" Accounts of how e all end different - Adebayor describe one fleet of 4x4 vehicles arrive to take di squad away even as dem still dey shoot from di forest, while Senaya remember silence. But eventually dem take all of dem to hospital for di outskirts of Cabinda City, wia those wey noting do help carry dia dead and colleagues wey wunjure inside. ""Those na di times wey you realise wetin dey happun really, wen I take one of di players inside di hospital,"" Adebayor tok. ""Wen I come out, I see all di players, and everyone bin dey cry, everyone bin dey tok about dia family, calling pipo, calling dia mama, dey cry for phone. ""I think dat na di worst moment of dis day, because you fit see pipo tell dia last words, because dem think say dem go die."" Shortly afta dat di squad security men leave di squad on dia own wit few local officials. Wit dead and injured friends and colleagues for hospital, dem later walk short distance to dia hotel compound, without any security whatsoever. Dat na wia I come across dem, and I walk wit di team as dem waka go back dia accommodation. All four teams for di group bin dey stay for di same compound and Kolo Toure and couple of oda Ivorians come to offer condolences and find out wetin happen - rumours bin done already spread. Di survivors den sidon to eat - e bin dey late for evening, by dis point dem neva chop anytin since. Throughout di meal, evriwia bin dey silent. Di news of di attack make global headlines, and wia 24 hours earlier I bin dey able to walk in simply wit tournament accreditation, di next day heavy paramilitary security surround di hotel complex. Officials, goment ministers and representatives of di Confederation of African Football fly in from Angola capital Luanda, wit questions about wetin happen, who dey responsible, and why - for sometin wey go against tournament rules - Togo decide to drive instead of fly. Shortly afta di attack claim of responsibility comot from di Front for di Liberation of di Enclave of Cabinda, wey be separatist group wey never don accept di decision of di former colonial power, Portugal, to integrate Cabinda into Angola in di late 1950s. Several factions of di body bin dey, and which one dey responsible no dey clear - but e clear from very early on say dis no be attempted robbery. Anoda question lie for di presence Angolan security wey travel with di team. If Togo no dey authorised to drive to Cabinda, why and how come dem even get escort? And na di militarised escort cause di attack? None of dis questions get clear answers, even 10 years on - and at di time di most immediate issue for di players na to absorb wetin don happen to dem and decide wetin to do next. For several days e no dey clear to those of us wey watch from di outside wetin go happen. Rumours suggest say split bin dey between those for camp wey want continue wit di tournament and those wey want go home. In di end, Togolese authorities for Lome take decision, dem call di squad home to attend di funeral of those wey die and take part in ceremonies of national mourning - decision wey later make Caf ban dem sake of alleged ""government interference"" for football. Few days afta dia terrifying experience, Togo Sparrowhawks come out of dia hotel complex for anoda heavily armed convoy, dis time dem head towards Cabinda airport, and later leave. But di consequences of wetin happen no go easily leave di mind of those wey involve for di assault. Two pipo bin die and a number of odas seriously wound - di worst na di goalkeeper, Obilale. Initially tori spread say im die too. Dat no dey true, but e suffer serious damage to im spine, intestines, liver and bladder, and dem transfer am go hospital for South Africa, to begin e recovery. Since den e don face eight major operations and don get to rebuild e life, physically and emotionally. ""I done do lot of tins, and I happy say I do dem. I go back to school, take exams, work and write book,"" im tok. For long time im work wit children with special needs, as e help dem through di medium of football, and e don set up e own organisation to continue dat work. Obilale lose e livelihood - and almost e life - for Cabinda and e dey striking say im tok say na since only di change in leadership for di Confederation of African Football for 2017, wen current president Ahmad comot Issa Hayatou, na im e don get any meaningful contact wit di continental governing body. On Tuesday night Caf give am special award, 10 years from Cabinda, to recognise e achievement for im recovery, and wetin e dey do to help odas. Cameroon legend Samuel Eto'o na di host for Hurghada, and e be one of several former players wey don provide steady support. Odas na e former captain Adebayor and Ghana Ayew brothers - Andre Ayew and e brother Rahim bin dey part of di Black Stars squad wey play for Cabinda for 2010. Even those wey e no affect physically face significant challenges for di wake of di attack. Junior Senaya, wey be player wey help take Togo to dia remarkable first World Cup for Germany for 2006, bin dey only 25 wen e happen, but e football career end dat day. ""E bin dey psychologically catastrophic, e turn [tins] upside down,"" na so im tok. ""I really no fit recover... I find no reason at all to play football for my club because psychologically I bin dey shocked."" Now im dey study for e coaching badges. E last for half an hour, maybe a little more. Why and how e happen na still di subject of some dispute. But no one fit deny di human cost of dat short bus trip for Cabinda, 10 years ago.
