health	Coronavirus in Kenya: 'I bury my cousin on Facebook Live'	"Dem place di chairs at least 1m (3ft) apart - family sidon for one side, church officials for di oda. Evribodi wear facemask. Evrione know di serious instructions wey di Kenyan goment don put for burials during di coronavirus pandemic. Only 15 pipo gather for di burial of my cousin, Chris, and everytin need finish by 09:00 local time. By 07:00 di rest of us gather, in front of our phones and computers, dey watch as di burial dey happun as my friend live-stream am on Facebook. Hundreds of us watch to pay our last respect to Chris. Im be pipo pesin - di life and soul of family parties. Im deep laugh go reach you even before e set foot inside di house - in fact, you fit hear am 200m away for gate. And Chris normally dey show up for pipo, weda na burial or weddings. E sabi ginger pipo for all occasions. So, on dis day, we show up for am too. But as we no dey dia, e no feel like na di same tin. Chris na my immediate cousin, but dem raise us for di same house and im bin be more like brother to me. Im die for Kisumu for western Kenya on Easter Sunday, afta e sick for few weeks wit liver cirrhosis. Di goment give us di guidelines for e burial. We gatz bury am within three days. But wit many of e family and friends under lockdown for di capital, Nairobi, no be evribodi fit attend di burial. Di sermon bin dey short. Di speeches bin dey restricted. And even singing no too dey. Chris bin love music wen e dey alive - im play di drum kit for di Salvation Army church band. So e dey painful say nobodi bin dey dia to play im favourite songs. I watch as live comments from e friends and colleagues begin appear in on Facebook. In order to use internet comfort demsef, pipo leave RIP messages and tok of how great a man Chris be wen im dey alive. And I bin tink say, maybe I for take screenshots and print am out becos dis mainly become our condolences book. Everytin bin feel so different.  We no fit hug, touch or see each other tears. We no fit throw sand on di coffin as dem dey put am for grave. When pesin wey you love die, we wan cry, look for comfort and closure. But how yo go do dis kind tins wen you no dey dia? I bin vex. I no ever imagine say I go bury my loved one through social media. I no ever tink say I go want human contact that much. E bin dey like feem, except say I dey part of pipo wey act am. And sadly, di Facebook Live fail, due to a poor network connection. So I no fit even watch Chris final journey to di very end. I no see wen dem put e coffin down inside grave. For many African societies death and life are dey togeda. Many traditions see death as rite of passage - a transition to another form. Hence why ancestors dey important - dem be di pipo wey don die but kontinu to ""live"" for di community. Dis, in turn, mean say wen pipo die dem must receive perfect burial - complete with rituals wey dem don observe for generations. For di communities for western Kenya wia I come from, like di Luo and Luhya, wen dem born pesin die and wen di pesin die na two important events. Dem dey treat pesin wey die wit respect and death and burial process dey to follow, to ensure mistake no dey. First of all burials dem no dey rush burials, especially for old pesin. Pesin death na call for celebration, even though pipo dey mourn and cry. E dey take at least one week to bury adult pesin. Loud mourning and crying, go last for days. Pipo come togeda to help di family of di pesin wey die to mourn. Dem go light Bonfire and pipo go gather around dem, embrace, cry, and relive di life of di pesin wey die. To kill animal dey part of di ritual, and di preparation and serving of food and drinks to console mourners. Na show of unity amongst neighbours and family. Dem go bring di dead home a day or two before di burial. They lie in di compound, to show say dem accept and love dem, even in death. Di Luo, a Nilotic people from western Kenya, have among di most elaborate burial customs for Kenya. At least 10 rites dey involved from the announcement of death, to di removal of di shadow or spirit of di dead from di homestead, to di shaving of family members' hair, and finally di remembrance ceremonies for di dead. All dis occasions require pipo to gather and interact in huge numbers. But during dis pandemic, most of dis rituals are dey off-limits, whether di pesin die of Covid-19 or not. During di two days between Chris' death and e burial, dem forbid pipo for house to sing with loud voice for night, becos dem go attract di neighbours wey go want come cry wit di family. Dem no light any bonfires to sit around. And during di burial, even for grave site, no hugging, or touching, no handshakes or kisses dey allowed. Goment representatives bin dey dia to ensure say pipo follow di rules f social distancing. Forty days afta dem bury somebody, dem suppose hold memorial service - di final celebration of dia life. Again, we no go fit do dis for Chris. I get dis feeling say I don only partially cry for Chris. Dis no be how e for deserve make pipo mourn am. Maybe wen all dis end - when we fit hug again, and cry for each other arms - we go mourn am like we suppose."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/world-52781527

business	Airlines strike in Nigeria update: Ibom air, Green Africa Airlines, Arik Air, Dana Air, odas go continue flight schedules as operators suspend action	"Di Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) don suspend dia plan to strike and stop flights schedule across di kontri. Di strike bin suppose start on Monday but di AON President Abdulmunaf Sarina tok inside statement wey six members of di association jointly sign say dem announce di suspension say dem do am in di interest of di national economy and security considerations. Di Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) bin don say di strike no go make sense and e go amount to exploitation if airlines suspend flights afta collecting money for tickets from passengers.

Di cost of JetA1, wey be aviation fuel don increase from N190 per litre to N700, dis na according to di airline operators of Nigeria. Abdulmunaf Sarina, president of di operators for letter wey e send to Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika say di high cost of di fuel dey affect di operation cost of airlines. E say, ""while aviation fuel worldwide dey cost about 40% of airline operating cost globally, di present hike don increase Nigeria operating cost to about 95%."" Abdulmunaf Sarina say airlines dey run at a loss sake of di situation and e no good for dia business. ""Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) hereby wish to regrettably inform di general public say member airlines go discontinue operations nationwide wit effect from Monday May 9, 2022 until further notice.""

But di minister say make di operators look for anoda means to address di mata rather dan suspend flight activities. E say, im no fit do much because mata wey concern fuel no dey under im ministry. ""While efforts to manage di situation dey on, we wish to appeal to di airline operators, even in di difficult situation, to consider di multiplier effect of shutting down operations, on Nigerians and global travellers, in taking dia business-informed decisions and actions,"" e tok for statement by im special assistant on public affairs, Dr James Odaudu. Dis no be di first time operators bin plan to take dis kain action. Wen e happun e dey affect air travel. For March dis year, di operators bin complain about di same aviation fuel but dem no fit reach resolution wit goment and stakeholders for di oil industry. Earlier dis year, airline operators increase price or air fare by 50%. For instance, a trip of N23,000 before increase to N50,000. Di operators claim say di increase for di price of tickets na sake of di high cost of aviation fuel. Air travellers complain wella during dat period but pipo still continue to travel by air. Wit di latest plan to bin suspend dia business, e no clear weda dem wan increase di price of dia ticket again. Di six airline operators wey bin sign di statement to suspend strike include Abdulmunaf - Managing Director of Azman Air; Shehu Wada - Executive Director of Max Air; and Obiora Okonkwo - Chairman of United Nigeria Airlines. Odas be Roy Ilegbodu - Chief Executive Officer of Arik Air; Abdullahi Mahmood - Chief Executive Officer of Aero Contractors; and Allen Onyema - Chairman of Air Peace. Earlier, di Ministry of Aviation bin assured Nigerians say members of AON bin dey review dia decision to withdraw services on Monday, May 9. Dem bin confam say Ibom Air, Green Africa Airlines, Arik Air, Dana Air, and odas go carry on with dia normal flight schedules. Incidents of insecurity don make some Nigerians avoid travelling by road. Di recent Kaduna-Abuja train attack by terrorists also neva comot from pipo mind. If airlines suspend dia operations as planned, Nigerians go begin look for oda means of traveling. Though Ibom airline don announce say dem no go join di suspension - only dem no go fit cater for all di thousands of travellers wey dey make dia trip by air. But di remaining alternative go come be di use of private jets or airplane charter. E get several private jet charter companies for Nigeria wey dey offer those services. Di service dey expensive. Findings show say, a 40 minute to one hour trip within di kontri, cost up to N2 million ($5,500). Some pipo fit also do join hire of a private jet wey fit carry specific number of pipo. Dem go share di bill among dem sef. E neva clear weda di airline suspension go take effect from Monday but pipo don begin reason oda alternatives."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-61369130

""And if you want to change dat and change our situation, you gatz to change leadership. Pure and simple. ""And e no get anybody wey go do am except di youths."" Obasanjo come later describe Nigeria as im own baby wey e go like to put beautiful bead on her waist and no be for any individual body. E get about 109,810,327 pipo wey dey over age 18 inside Nigeria, according to one worldometer report. Na from 18 years and above dem dey reason say pesin don be youth inside di west African kontri. Dis number fit form half of Nigeria population wey dey projected at ova 200 million pipo, according to UNFPA. Also, according to di United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) 54% of di kontri population dey between di age of 15-64. Wen e come to di average of a Nigerian citizen, di kontri dey relatively young.

But many kontries also draw di line on youth with regard to di age wey pesin fit get equal treatment under di law Often dem dey refer to am as di 'age of majority.' Dis age na commonly 18 years for many kontries. So once pesin reach dis age, he or she go dey considered to be adult. However, di operational definition of di term 'youth' different from kontri to kontri. E dey depending on relative sociocultural, institutional, economic and political factors."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-62616466

sports	Premier League prediction for dis weekend matches	D﻿i Premier League go return dis weekend afta di international break. All eye go dey on di two derby match dem for London and Manchester. D﻿i two fixtures get a lot of history and big rivalry. Na Arsenal go open di Premier show dis weekend wen dem host Tottenham D﻿i Premier League leaders go play di game for Emirates Stadium. BBC football expert Chris Sutton go predict di outcomes of di fixtures for dis weekend. Sutton  along wit Sports Team drummer Al Greenwood, wey be Manchester United fan go share im prediction too.. Checkout dia prediction. Arsenal start di season so well, dem don win six out of seven league games. Dia only defeat come for Manchester United, and dem no deserve to lose dia. Meanwhile Tottenham dey only one point behind dem. You fit make case for either team here, but my mind dey go wit Arsenal - and for dis game I dey plenty goals. Sutton prediction: 3-2 Al prediction: Arsenal go dey hope to repeat dia women performance against Spurs last weekend - and di result as well. I dey back Mikel Arteta side to win too, because although Tottenham also dey well, dia performances no always dey matched dia results. 2-1 Bournemouth fans dey para for me because  I dey write them off every week, and now dem dey unbeaten in dia past three games. Meanwhile Brentford bin dey disappointing against Arsenal for dia last game, but I feel say dem go respond here. Sutton prediction: 0-1 Al's prediction: Dis one dey very difficult to call, I chang my mind a few times - but I feel say Bournemouth go get something. 1-1 I no really know wetin to expect from Chelsea hia, and whether anything go click at all or change dramatically for Graham Potter first league game in charge. Crystal Palace go make tins difficult for them but I feel say we go see improvement from di Blues, and e fit dey enough for victory. Sutton prediction: 1-2 Al prediction: Palace dey hard to break down, but dem no really offer enough threat for di oda end. E look like say Graham Potter don make a big difference for Chelsea already and with di boost e don give di players, I go back here. 1-3 Newcastle no really dey good form, na only once dem don win dis season. So, I dey go for a draw here. Being honest, Fulham don surprise me wit di way dem start dis season so well. Dem clearly believe in di way dey play. Sutton prediction: 1-1 Al prediction: Aleksandar Mitrovic dey fine form dis season and I feel say im go score a couple more goals against im old team. 2-1 Brighton bin get good record here under Potter, wit one draw and one win for dia past two visits. But dis na di first time wey go see dem under dia new boss Roberto De Zerbi. Sutton prediction: 3-1 Al prediction: Liverpool form get as e be so far, but we no really know what to expect from Brighton under De Zerbi. E go dey interesting how dem go be. 1-1 I no really know wetin to tok about of Southampton. Sometimes dem dey play wit blood and thunder under Ralph Hasenhuttl, but oda dem no dey to attack very much at all. Everton don improve but, just like Newcastle dem be draw specialists for Premier League dis season, and I  dey see dem share di points. Sutton prediction: 1-1 Al prediction: I can see why dis two teams dey di bottom half of di table – dem dey so inconsistent. 1-0 Diego Costa fit make im Wolves debut here, but I feel say we need to dey realistic about what to expect from him. Dis no be di Costa we see for Chelsea, for di peak of im powers. Now at 33 e neva play a competitive game dis year. West Ham too dey struggle, but I feel say dem deserve more points than wetin dem get. Sutton prediction: 1-0 Al prediction: Both teams don only score three times apiece for dia first seven league games, so we no go see many goals for dis one! 0-1 For all di positive about Manchester United progress under Erik ten Hag, dem dey play Manchester City - wey be di best team for di kontri and by far di best team for Manchester. United fit cause dem problems for counter, but dem go dey really gingered for dis game. Sutton prediction: 4-1 Al prediction: We don beat City for Etihad Stadium a few times in the past couple of years, wey suggest say we get chance this time - but going there dey make my heart beat. So I dey go for a highly optimistic victory. 1-2 Leeds boss Jesse Marsch no go dey bench aft aim chop red card against Brentford last month. Him side go still play wit di same great intensity though, and Elland Road always seems to lift them. Villa big win ova Southampton last time, but their results on for road so far dey been poor, wi three defeats out of three, and I don't see that changing here. Sutton prediction: 2-1 Al prediction: Dis fit be a really good game. Leeds always turn up whether good or bad, there is always something happening. Villa will sit back more, but if Leeds score early e fit really be open game. 3-2  Dis na di bottom two teams and really anything fit happen here. E dey hard to suppport either side to win it, because we know dis flaws. Sutton prediction: 2-1 Al prediction: We know say Leicester na good team but they have been really poor so far. Sometimes it takes a derby game like this to kickstart your season.	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c4n01zd7k8do

Di rising cost of living and climate change dey among wetin be di two key issues for voters. But most pipo dey see di election as vote on di leaders characters.

Scott Morrison, wey lead di Liberal-National Coalition, na di first leader to serve full term in office since John Howard, wey win four elections before losing to Labor party pesin, Kevin Rudd for 2007. E become di 30th Prime Minister on 24 August 2018, afta e take ova from Malcolm Turnbull.

Di 53-year-old also don face plenti criticism - from members of im own party to di French President. E agree say e dey unpopular, and admit say e fit be ""bulldozer"" and fit be ""more sensitive"" leader. But Morrison also defend im approach as wetin dey needed during di pandemic. Anthony Albanese get reputation as defender of Australia free healthcare system, advocate for di LGBT community, a republican, and passionate rugby league fan. E dey Active for di Labor Party from young age, and don work for both federal and state politics before dem elect am as member of parliament on im 33rd birthday, to one inner-city Sydney seat for 1996. For 2007, wen Labor collect power under Kevin Rudd, oga Albanese become di minister for infrastructure and transport. Albanese separate from im wife of 19 years for 2019 but im partner, Jodie Haydon dey always join am for im campaign trail.

E promise voters ""safe change"" as e battle di perception of pipo wey feel say e no dey experience enough to lead di kontri as Australia dey recover from tough times.

Either party go need to win at least 76 of di 151 seats for House of Representatives - wia di prime minister dey sit- to form a majority goment. If dem no fit do that, dey must try to win support from independent MPs, or those from minor parties. Most likely late on election day, but e fit take longer if di contest dey close.

Wit just a little over a month or five weeks before di governorship election for Edo State, wetin Buhari do mean say im go back im party candidate over im friend and current Govnor Godwin Obaseki wey dey also contest di 19 September vote. Na just for June, wen Obaseki never port comot di president APC party, na im e meet Presido Buhari to show am say e don buy nomination form to contest di June primaries as Governorship aspirant for Nigeria ruling APC before e finally port comot go join di main opposition PDP. Govnor Godwin Obaseki dey find second term for office but APC screening committee disqualify am on top alleged fake certificate, before e port comot go join PDP.

For Nigeria, di president party or di party wey im dey support get higher chance to win governorship elections. Politics na game of numbers and every state dey important to any political party. For Nigeria ruling All Progressive Congress party, di more states wey dem get to govern, di more power wey dem go fit enjoy on top different states.
