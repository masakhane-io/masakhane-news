business	House prices: What happens when they fall?	"Annual house price growth has slowed, and the latest monthly figures from both Nationwide and Halifax show a fall. 
follows the Bank of England's decision to increase interest rates to 3%, meaning higher mortgage costs for many. 
In the last two years, prices rose steeply - by about a quarter - across most of the UK. 
f growth was much faster than was seen after the 2008 global financial crisis, when houses lost about a sixth of their value. It took five years, on average, for prices to recover.
However, prices have now started to slow, with figures from both Nationwide and Halifax showing falls between October and November. 
rt above of annual, rather than monthly, growth shows that year-on-year growth is heading down towards zero. 
Nationwide warned the housing market looked set to ""remain subdued"" in the coming months. 
Monthly changes can be blips, but the UK's largest lender, Lloyds, is planning for an 8% fall next year. 
In November, the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), which advises the government on the health of the economy - predicted that house prices will drop by 9% over the next two years.
Big jumps in interest rates put pressure on the amount people can afford to offer for houses, and that means less demand.  
Mortgage affordability also depends on wider cost-of-living pressures like energy bills, wages and job security. The future of house prices depends on the economy as a whole. 
ggest immediate effect is on people who want to move.
Some sellers may decide to delay putting their homes on the market. Homeowners who are considering moving may find they have less money to spend. 
re were fewer property sales this year than in the 12 months leading up to last summer's surge in prices before the temporary stamp duty reduction ended.
But if interest rates stay high, an increasing number of people will come off fixed-price mortgages (about 100,000 each month) to new, higher rates. 
Some homeowners will find higher these monthly payments unaffordable, making them more likely to sell. 
First-time buyers may find properties are more affordable, allowing them to get a foot on the ladder - assuming they can get a mortgage. 
But a drop in prices can also send shudders through the finances of homeowners who are staying put. 
At the most extreme, they can end up in negative equity - where the amount they have borrowed is greater than the current value of their property.
With about a third of household wealth tied up in home values, falling prices can make people feel less financially secure, mean they save more than they spend. 
Less spending can make an economic slowdown even worse.
Arrears peaked during the 2008 financial crisis, and did not rise significantly during the pandemic, helped by lenders granting payment holidays. 
Payment difficulties can lead to banks and building societies repossessing houses, although lenders try to avoid this. 
More than 200,000 properties were repossessed in the five years after the 2008 crash. 
As a result of Covid, repossessions were suspended between March 2020 and April 2021. In the year after they restarted, there were fewer than 4,000. 
When the Bank of England raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points to 3% on 3 November, it was the biggest single rise in the cost of borrowing since 1989.
After the mini-budget, financial markets were forecasting that the Bank of England's interest rate would rise above 6% in 2023. 
However, traders now expect the peak to be under 5%. You can use the mortgage calculator above to see how rate changes affect monthly repayments. 
In the early 2000s property boom, 100% mortgages and cashback offers were not uncommon. 
But after the 2008 financial crash, mortgage lending rules were tightened. 
As a result, loans should leave more room for prices to fall before borrowers are stuck with negative equity. 
Most recent borrowers have also had their ability to pay checked against interest rates even higher than the ones we're seeing at the moment.

business	Is it right to raise interest rates in a recession?	"Bank of England is like the organiser of a bonfire night party. In one hand it has the jerry can full of petrol to fling over the pile of wet logs, in the other there's a fire extinguisher ready to put it out almost at the same time.
's rate rise is designed to dampen down the economy and stamp out entrenched inflation. But the other announcement, that future rises will be limited, and peak interest rates should not rise above 5%, shows just how worried the Bank is about the overall impact on the economy, and especially the mortgage market.
UK is facing the start of a ""very challenging"" two-year recession, according to the Bank, the longest recession ever recorded in official statistics, and yet interest rates will carry on going up, after eight rises, including today's jumbo rise of to 3%. 
As if in recognition of this difficult to explain stance, the Bank has done something it doesn't normally do in the published minutes of its decisions. In order to reassure the markets and the public that rises won't just keep going up at this kind of rate, potentially killing off any sparks of growth, future rises are expected to ""peak lower than priced into financial markets"". 
Governor Bailey told me that the net effect of today's announcements could be that fixed mortgage rates don't reach the 6%-plus level that seemed likely in the aftermath of the mini-budget. Although variable rate mortgages will go up automatically as a result of today's interest rate rise, fixed mortgage rates are influenced more by assumptions about where rates will go over two or five years. Mr Bailey is managing those expectations down, even as he actually raises current rates. It is a tricky manoeuvre.
fferent approach to that taken by, for example, the USA. The rhetoric and actions of the Federal Reserve have been unrelenting in attacking inflation, in saying that they have a bias towards raising rates higher, even than necessary, because moves can always be rowed back.
But the US is in a different situation. The Bank of England's approach reflects the fact that the UK balancing act is much more delicate. The forecast two-year recession would mean zero growth over the entire post-pandemic period, and indeed over the five-year parliament, following the 2019 election.
mic, its aftermath, the war in Ukraine, and the energy shock, are the fuel for all of this of course. But with the Bank and the government pointing to more pain and sacrifice for millions of households, who are already facing multi-thousand pound increases in mortgage, energy and tax bills, people would be forgiven for asking: have decisions made here in Britain served to fan the flames?"	/news/business-63498306
business	Pound in biggest monthly fall against the dollar since 2016	"Worries over the prospects for the UK economy led the pound to slide by about 5% against the US dollar in August.
me the pound fell so much against the dollar was in October 2016, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.
Sterling sank again on Thursday morning, dipping below $1.16 on the currency markets.
Analysts said the fall reflects the darkening outlook for the economy, with consumers and businesses facing rising prices and soaring energy bills.
Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year.
weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far.
""Our economic prospects are not looking particularly good compared to the rest of the world,"" said Laura Lambie, senior investment director at Investec.
Ms Lambie said that recession fears were weighing on markets, with the investment bank Goldman Sachs warning this week that the UK could remain in recession until 2024.
A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods.
August was also the worst month for the pound against the euro since the middle of last year.
UK government bonds - or debt - had their worst month for decades. Investors, worried about the riskiness of lending to the government, demanded higher returns for doing so, making it more expensive for the country to borrow money. In August, the yields, or the effective interest rate you would get, on some of those bonds have jumped the most since 1994.
Colin Ellis from ratings agency Moody's told the BBC's Today programme the jump in yields needed to be put in context. ""Energy bills are very very high, and set to go up again. which means inflation is going to be high and that the Bank of England is raising interest rates in response.
""Those expectations for higher interest rates are part of what's driving these moves in the bond market at the moment."" 
However, he said: ""We still have a stable outlook on our UK government rating so we see the risk as broadly balanced. We're not very concerned but of course a lot will depend on the policies that the next government chooses to put into place.""
Fears have grown over the prospects for the UK economy after figures showed it shrank between April and June, with businesses and households feeling the impact of rising prices.
rns were fuelled on Thursday, with a new study suggesting the manufacturing sector shrank in August for the first time since May 2020.
Separately, a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank said typical household disposable incomes are on course to fall by 10%, or Â£3,000, over this year and next, which is called the ""the deepest living standards squeeze in a century"".
-of-living crisis is set to be the biggest challenge facing the new Prime Minister.
Both Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have come under pressure to outline how they would support households if they succeed in getting the keys to Number 10.
''Grim forecasts about poverty spreading across the UK this winter highlight the deepening woes for the UK economy"", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
Bank of England raised interest rates to 1.75% in August, while forecasting that the UK economy would fall into recession this year.
But Ms Streeter predicts that the Bank of England might be forced to slow down rate rises in the coming months, given the cost of living crisis.
und's weakness is also a result of a strong dollar, analysts said.
r is performing strongly due to US interest rate rises and because investors see it as a safer bet.
Last week, the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve, indicated it would push ahead with further interest rate rises as it seeks to control inflation.
""The dollar has been exceptionally strong,"" Ms Lambie said.
""Also, the issues that we've had in Europe around energy do not have the same impact as the US, and I think economists are fairly agreed that the US will be the last to go into recession if they do go into recession at all, perhaps following the UK and Europe.
""So on both sides, from the sterling side and from the dollar side, that's really what has weakened sterling and strengthened the dollar."""	/news/business-62750606
technology	Meta settles Cambridge Analytica scandal case for $725m	"Facebook owner Meta has agreed to pay $725m (Â£600m) to settle legal action over a data breach linked to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
g-running dispute accused the social media giant of allowing third parties, including the British firm, to access Facebook users' personal data. 
roposed sum is the largest in a US data privacy class action, lawyers say.
Meta, which did not admit wrongdoing, said it had ""revamped"" its approach to privacy over the past three years. 
In a statement, the company said settling was ""in the best interest of our community and shareholders"".
""We look forward to continuing to build services people love and trust with privacy at the forefront.""
uthor James Ball told the BBC it was ""not a surprise"" that Meta has had to agree to a serious pay-out but that it was ""not that much"" money to the tech giant.
""It's less than a tenth of what it spent on its efforts to create 'the metaverse' last year alone,"" he said.
""So Meta probably won't be too unhappy with this deal, but it does stand as a warning to social media companies that mistakes can prove very costly indeed.""
uggested settlement, which was disclosed in a court filing late on Thursday, is subject to the approval of a federal judge in San Francisco. 
""This historic settlement will provide meaningful relief to the class in this complex and novel privacy case,"" lead lawyers for the plaintiffs, Derek Loeser and Lesley Weaver, said in a statement.
mplaint was filed on behalf of a large proposed class of Facebook users, whose personal data on the social network was released to third parties without their consent.
ze is ""in the range of 250-280 million"" people, according to the ruling document, representing all Facebook users in the US during the ""class period"" which runs from 24 May, 2007 to 22 December, 2022. 
It is not clear how the plaintiffs would claim their share of the settlement.
Janis Wong, a privacy and ethics researcher at The Alan Turing Institute, said it would only amount to two or three dollars per person if each individual decided to make a claim.
A further hearing on the settlement is due to take place on 2 March, 2023.
""Even though this $725m settlement doesn't cover UK users, earlier this year a competition law expert put forward a multi-billion dollar class action suit against Meta regarding users' data exploitation that does cover the Cambridge Analytica period. 
""We should hear more about that from the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal in the new year,"" she told the BBC.
How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded
rvesting of Facebook users' personal information by third-party apps was at the centre of the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, exposed in 2018.
ulting firm, now defunct, worked for Donald Trump's successful presidential campaign in 2016, and used personal information from millions of US Facebook accounts for the purposes of voter profiling and targeting.
firm obtained that information without users' consent from a researcher who had been allowed by Facebook to deploy an app on the platform which harvested data from millions of its users.
Facebook believes the data of up to 87 million people was improperly shared with the political consultancy.
rompted government investigations into Facebook's privacy practices, leading to lawsuits and a high-profile US congressional hearing in which Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg was questioned.
In 2019, Facebook agreed to pay $5bn to resolve a Federal Trade Commission probe into its privacy practices.
giant also paid $100 million to settle US Securities and Exchange Commission claims that it misled investors about the misuse of users' data.
Investigations by state attorneys general are continuing, and the company is challenging a legal action by the attorney general for Washington DC."	/news/technology-64075067

business	Oil giant TotalEnergies to cut North Sea investment over windfall tax	"French oil giant TotalEnergies has said it will cut North Sea investment by 25% next year after the windfall tax on oil and gas firms in the UK was extended.
mpany will cut Â£100m of spending on new wells in the region.
windfall tax - the Energy Profits Levy - was raised from 25% to 35% in last month's Autumn Statement and will now stay in place until March 2028.
government said the levy ""strikes a balance between funding cost of living support while encouraging investment"".
""We have been clear that we want to encourage reinvestment of the sector's profits to support the economy, jobs, and our energy security, which is why the more investment a firm makes into the UK, the less tax they will pay,"" a Treasury spokesperson said.
However, a spokesperson for the Scottish government said: ""This decision highlights the fiscal and economic turmoil caused by the UK government is already having very real implications for Scottish industry.""
""We have also been consistently clear that the implementation of a windfall tax must involve a balanced approach across sectors and companies - not just energy companies, disproportionately based in Scotland.""
Energies is one of the North Sea's biggest oil and gas producers and its decision to cut investment will affect plans to drill a new well at its Elgin gas field.
""Following another change to the fiscal environment for energy investors in the UK, we are now evaluating the impact of this change on our current and planned projects,"" said TotalEnergies' UK chairman Jean-Luc Guiziou.
""The energy industry operates in a cyclical market and is subject to volatile commodity prices. We believe that the government should remain open to reviewing the Energy Profits Levy if prices reduce before 2028.""
windfall tax on oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea was introduced in May after oil prices increased sharply.
Oil prices had already been increasing as Covid restrictions were lifted around the world, but they jumped when Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to worries over energy supplies.
rate for the EPL was set at 25% originally. However, in the Autumn Statement last month, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced it would increase to 35% from January 2023, and stay in place until March 2028. It had previously been scheduled to finish at the end of 2025.
Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea are already taxed differently to other firms. Taxes on their profits are higher - they pay 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that. Other firms currently pay corporation tax at 19%.
However, energy firms can also claim tax savings worth 91p of every Â£1 invested in fossil fuel extraction in the UK.
Neivan Boroujerdi from energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said that while TotalEnergies is the second biggest producer in the North Sea, it is not set to be one of the biggest investors over the next few years.
""That's partly the reason why it's so adversely affected by the levy (windfall tax) in the first place, because they can't use the investment allowances to offset their levy payments against,"" Mr Boroujerdi said.
Last week, Brindex, an organisation representing smaller independent oil exploration companies in the North Sea, wrote to the chancellor saying the windfall tax increase represented an ""existential threat"" to the industry.
Robin Allen, the chairman of Brindex, said in the letter that its members can ""no longer shoulder this extreme open ended tax burden"", and warned that it could impact jobs and the country's energy security.
Like TotalEnergies, Brindex has called for a price floor mechanism whereby the windfall tax would only be triggered above a certain price level for oil and gas.
Both Shell and BP have said that they will review North Sea investments following the tax increase, but have not announced any specific cuts to spending in the region.
main North Sea industry body, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), said the decision to increase the EPL was ""undermining investor confidence"".
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of OEUK, said: ""Our industry was planning to invest Â£200bn in the broader energy sector - this includes low-carbon solutions - by 2030. This would help to ensure that the UK can meet its net-zero and climate goals and boost its energy security while we make that low-carbon transition. 
""But... these tax changes really do jeopardise this.""
Wood Mackenzie's Mr Boroujerdi said many people in the industry agreed ""something had to be done"" when the EPL was first introduced in May. 
""We saw energy prices spiralling out of control [and] eye-watering profits. But moving the goal posts for a second time in the space of six months hasn't gone down well and it's not conducive to future investment.""
However, Philip Evans, oil campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the windfall tax was ""nowhere near strong enough"".
""Ultimately investments like those from TotalEnergies are a terrible deal for the British people. The jobs they provide are increasingly precarious. The fossil fuels they seek to extract will only trash our climate targets,"" he said.
""The future of the North Sea is in renewable energy and the quicker the government wakes up and helps us get there the better."""	/news/business-63834419
health	Sheffield Covid coma musician relearns guitar for comeback	"A musician who spent more than two years relearning to sing and play the guitar after being in a coma is to perform a comeback gig with his band. 
Graham Rodgers nearly died after suffering a stroke and further complications following a Covid infection in March 2020.
62-year-old from Sheffield spent a month in a coma and finally woke when nurses played him his own music.
He said performing again with his band Calico Fever ""meant everything"".
Mr Rodgers collapsed at home after having the stroke, which was caused by increased blood coagulation and clotting.
While in hospital he suffered three further minor strokes, a heart attack, pneumonia, septicaemia, blood clots on his lungs and had to be revived three times.
Mr Rodgers, from Frecheville, said: ""At one point I heard music in the distance and it got a bit louder, then I could hear some women talking and then I thought, 'they're my songs'.
""I opened my eyes and I remember a nurse saying, 'he's come back to us'.""
He was discharged after three months and since then has had to relearn to walk, talk, read and write, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said. 
Discussing relearning the guitar, he said: ""One day I picked it up and it was like going back to square one - I burst into tears because I thought I had lost music.
""But then I thought how lucky I am still to be here and how I owe it to all those people who didn't survive Covid to stick at it.""
Mr Rodgers, who has invited the medical staff who cared for him to the gig at Greystones pub in Sheffield on Saturday night, said he ""owed his life to the heroic efforts of NHS staff"".
""Saying thank you doesn't seem enough, I have a life again now,"" he added.

politics	PMQs: Keir Starmer calls on Rishi Sunak to end 'scandal' of private school tax breaks	"Labour leader questions the PM on private school ""handouts""
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to end the ""scandal"" of tax breaks for private schools. 
Private schools can claim charitable status so are eligible for tax relief. 
During Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir highlighted the Mr Sunak's old school, Winchester College, and asked why it received ""taxpayers' money"". 
But Mr Sunak accused the Labour leader of ""attacking the hard-working aspiration of millions of people"".
Most private schools have charitable status, which means they are exempt from paying VAT on school fees. 
In England and Wales, private schools with charitable status also get at least 80% relief on business rates.
However, in Scotland this discount was removed in April. 
Sir Keir clashed with Mr Sunak over the issue during PMQs and took aim at Mr Sunak's old independent school.
""Winchester College has a rowing club, a rifle club, an extensive art collection, they charge over Â£45,000 a year in fees,"" he said. 
""Why did [the prime minister] hand them nearly Â£6m of taxpayers' money this year in what his Levelling Up Secretary [Michael Gove] calls egregious state support?""
Mr Sunak responded: ""Whenever he attacks me about where I went to school, he is attacking the hard-working aspiration of millions of people in this country, he's attacking people like my parents.
""This is a country that believes in opportunity not resentment. He doesn't understand that and that's why he's not fit to lead."" 
In a 2017 column for the Times, Mr Gove asked how tax breaks for private schools were ""justified"", describing this as ""egregious state support"".
A YouGov poll in September found 47% of people thought private schools should lose their tax exemptions. 
But the Independent Schools Council has warned Labour's proposals to charge VAT on private school fees would ""have the greatest impact on the families who work the hardest to pay the fees"", describing the idea as a ""tax on aspiration"". 
It said the policy would ""threaten the survival of the smallest independent schools"" and see more pupils move to the state sector, putting more pressure on the schools budget. 
Sir Keir suggested the money for private school tax exemptions would be better spent driving up standards in the state sector. 
If it wins power, Labour has said it would use the savings to fund the ""most ambitious school improvement programme for a generation"".
In response Mr Sunak said the government had already announced billions more in funding for state schools and standards had improved under the Conservatives.  
Sir Keir also used PMQs to attack Mr Sunak as ""weak"", highlighting an attempt by some Tory MPs to ban mandatory housebuilding targets in England. 
government delayed a vote after nearly 50 rebels backed the idea. 
Sir Keir said Labour would lend the government the votes it needs to pass the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill with mandatory housing targets.
wo days in a row this week, the Daily Mail has been gunning for Labour on the issue of private schools and Sir Keir Starmer's policy that their charitable status should be removed - meaning VAT would be payable on school fees.
So it is interesting that Sir Keir has decided to lean into it at PMQs, rather than talk about something else - and highlight it as a dividing line with the Conservative Party.
And it is interesting too that the prime minister uses the language of ""aspiration"" to champion his perspective that the current arrangement is justified and in the interests of parents and pupils in both the private and state sectors.
g picture strategy from the Labour Party is to try to portray Rishi Sunak as weak and beholden to his backbenchers.
Hence Sir Keir's offer to back the government's plan - which Mr Sunak avoided mentioning - to maintain housebuilding targets in England, which some Tory backbenchers want rid of.
Conservative parliamentary party is relieved that Mr Sunak has brought stability - it being better than the alternative of perpetual meltdown.
But the PM's challenge heading into 2023 will be how much he can actually get done."	/news/uk-politics-63806421
business	Campaigners oppose 112-mile East Anglia power line	"A planned 112 mile-long (180km) power line suspended mostly on new pylons across East Anglia should be run under the sea, campaigners said.
National Grid said the high voltage line, between Norwich, Suffolk and Essex, was needed to carry electricity from offshore wind turbines.
It said the ""essential"" line would also be used by the proposed new Sizewell C nuclear power station.
Essex MP, Sir Bernard Jenkin, said the plan was a ""non-starter"".
roposed 400kV electricity transmission line, called the East Anglia Green Energy Enablement project, would run between Norwich and a new Bramford substation near Ipswich, and then to Tilbury in south Essex, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
It would use 164ft high (50m) steel pylons, except for where it would run underground through the Dedham Vale area of outstanding natural beauty on the Suffolk/Essex border.
Sir Bernard, Conservative MP for Harwich and North Essex, is chairman of the Off Shore Electricity Grid Task Force (OffSET) which is a group MPs who want to protect rural locations in Suffolk and Essex from new overground pylons and cabling.
He said: ""What we cannot have is cheap and cheerful patchwork solutions.
""The current plans are a non-starter.""
MP said rather than building new pylons, or running the cabling underground which would be too expensive, they should be looking at more offshore solutions to connect the three substations to limit the effect on the countryside.
He said: ""We need a much more environment-friendly solution, and I look forward to working with local residents to have their voices heard.""
Rosie Pearson, from the Essex Suffolk Norfolk Pylons action group, said the proposed line would ""result in an unacceptable industrialization of our precious and beautiful East Anglian landscapes"".
""It will have an impact on wildlife, communities and businesses. That has not been taken into account,"" she said.
She agreed a ""properly planned offshore grid"" would be the group's preferred option.
Liam Walker, from the National Grid, said the project was ""essential to carry more clean energy to homes and businesses across the UK, and to help the country reach net zero by 2050"".
A public consultation on the plans runs until 16 June.

business	Jaguar Land Rover cuts output at UK factories due to chip shortage	"Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is reducing output at its factories in Solihull and Halewood until the spring, due to ongoing problems obtaining enough computer chips for new vehicles.
xpected to affect the output of models such as the Jaguar F-Pace and Land Rover Discovery Sport.
move is understood to be temporary, as first reported in the Guardian.
In the meantime, JLR will focus on more profitable models such as the Range Rover.
Output of these cars has been ramped up in recent months. 
JLR's factory in Nitra, Slovakia, is not affected. 
Modern cars are heavily reliant on computer chips to control a variety of onboard systems, ranging from anti-lock braking and emissions controls to satellite navigation and in-car entertainment.
But supplies from East Asia have been heavily disrupted in the wake of the Covid pandemic, while carmakers have faced intense competition for available supplies from other industries.
In a statement, JLR said it would ""continue to actively manage the operational patterns of our manufacturing plants whilst the industry experiences ongoing global semi-conductor supply chain disruption"".
""We expect our performance to continue improving in the second half of the year, as new agreements with semiconductor partners take effect, enabling us to build and deliver more vehicles to our clients,"" it added.
UK car production still remains well below levels seen before the pandemic, despite an increase in October, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show.    
ustry built 69,524 cars in October, up 7.4% from a year earlier, but the SMMT said manufacturers were still suffering from ""turbulent"" supplies of components.
""There's been real shortages in the supply chain, most obviously in semiconductors, which is leading to really erratic levels of production,"" the SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes told the BBC's Today programme.
""[Production] was up in October, but we expect it to be volatile as we go forward especially when some parts come from China.""
Mr Hawes said the UK was ""no way close"" to making enough chips for the car industry.
""Massive investments are required and some governments in the world are putting up billions upon billions of pounds to attract investment and build new fabs (semiconductor fabrication plants).
""We should be building about a million cars a year, so when you have about 1,500 chips per car you can see just how incredible the volumes of these chips you need just to support the automotive industry, let alone things like personal electronics."" "	/news/business-63756079

Laugher, a two-time Olympic and three-time world medallist in the event, scored fewer than 50 points with three of his six dives as Italy won gold and bronze.
Houlden, 24, won silver - his first individual European medal - with a total of 428.55 points, 25.30 shy of newly crowned champion Lorenzo Marsaglia.
Spendolini-Sirieix capped a memorable few weeks with a second European title as she and Toulson, 22, finished 4.74 points ahead of Ukraine's silver medallists.
Germany won bronze, with Italy missing out in a field of four pairs.
r victory came just weeks after Spendolini-Sirieix - the daughter of TV personality Fred Sirieix - won two gold medals and a silver at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.
""I'm so happy to finish the season with Lois by my side, it was a great last dive and I'm ready for summer,"" she told BBC Sport.
ulson added: ""We've been quite lucky that this was our first time together. 
""We've literally done those dives once before the competition and for it to go that well it proves to us that we are pretty good.""
For 17-year-old Spendolini-Sirieix, it marks a third medal of the Championships, having won the individual 10m title earlier in the week as well as mixed team bronze.
On Tuesday, Toulson, 22, took European gold in the mixed synchronised 10m platform event with British team-mate Kyle Kothari.
Houlden was in fourth place after round two of the men's 3m springboard before a stellar third-round effort catapulted him up the standings.
, a reverse three-and-a-half somersaults in tuck, tied for the best of the competition with a score of 84.00.
It marks the end of a breakthrough season for Houlden, in which he also won two medals at the Commonwealth Games.
""It feels absolutely mindblowing. This is probably the best year I've had so far, hopefully there is more to come,"" he told BBC Sport.
""Now I'm finished for the season so I get to rest for a bit, have a bit of time off.""
Laugher, meanwhile, led after two rounds but a third-round score of 49.30 saw him slip down.
He made amends on dive four, scoring 79.20, but it wasn't enough as further errors crept into his performance.
27-year-old is back on the boards on Sunday, competing in the men's synchronised 3m springboard with Anthony Harding. "	/sport/diving/62618602
entertainment	James Corden: How Jez Butterworth's 'bombshell' drama lured him back to acting	"Writer Jez Butterworth is no stranger to black comedy. Best-known for award-winning plays such as Mojo, Jerusalem and The Ferryman, his work has tackled heavy-duty themes such as toxic masculinity and national identity but always with a dollop of dark humour. 
His latest work is Prime Video TV series Mammals, another edgy comic tale centred around the age-old yet endlessly fascinating themes of marriage, monogamy and infidelity.
It stars James Corden in his first major acting role since he announced his departure from The Late Late Show in the US, a high-profile gig which has seen slots such as Carpool Karaoke go viral and its YouTube channel draw in just under 10 billion views.
It was not without controversy, however, with the host facing criticism on occasion for some of his sketches, including a slot called Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Gut, which was accused of mocking traditional Asian food. After complaints, he said he would not use the food items in question anymore.
Corden has now returned to the UK and his acting roots and tells me he just could not turn down Butterworth's script: ""I can remember so vividly where I was when I read it - Jez had written one episode -  and I was just blown away by it. I don't know if I've seen anything like it, but I had to be involved.""
Without giving too much away, Mammals follows the complicated relationships of two couples, restaurateur Jamie (Corden) and Amandine (Melia Kreiling), and veterinary academic Geoff (Colin Morgan) and creative Lou (Sally Hawkins), who also happens to be Jamie's sister.
While the themes may be familiar, the trajectory certainly isn't. 
Corden explains: ""I can remember reading it and thinking four pages in 'OK, I think I know what the show is.' And then four pages later going 'Oh, well no, it's not that. It must be this' and then 10 pages later going 'OK, I've no idea what this is!'
""You get to the end of episode three and think 'Oh my god, where's this gonna go?' and then Jez drops another bombshell because it goes somewhere you would never, ever predict that it would. I just think it's a unique show.""
It's certainly not a series you can watch while scrolling on your phone simultaneously. As you might expect from Butterworth, Mammals features intelligent storytelling that keeps you on your toes, with so many plot twists, it can leave your head spinning.
writer, who is already penning a second series, says: ""I wanted it to have the simplicity of a cup and ball trick. You've got four cups, which one is it under? And for that to be completely surprising every time it happens. Just the simplicity of a conjuring trick.""
It's perhaps best described as a romantic whodunnit, leading the viewer down several garden paths before it reaches its suckerpunch denouement. Revenge is clearly a dish best served cold.
""I think what's really interesting about what Jez has written here, without trying to give anything away, is we can so often forgive or dismiss our own behaviours, or find reason,"" Corden explains. 
""And then, if those behaviours are suddenly presented back to you... I think we've all had conversations with friends, where you might put to them that perhaps their behaviour was part of this and they're responsible. [And they'll go]: 'Yeah, but that was different.'""
Butterworth says: ""When you boil it down to its absolute essential, if you and I are in a relationship, and I cheat on you, I will probably find some way to square that away if you're never going to find out about it. But if I discovered you've cheated on me, it's biblical. Why is one worse than the other?""
While some of the characters' actions may seem extreme, Kreiling says: ""It's not too far off what people are capable of doing when they're heartbroken. Or when they're in love. I mean, if love doesn't make you do crazy things, what does?""
ries has gone down well with critics, according to early reviews. The Telegraph's Anita Singh described it as ""a quality comedy-drama which never loses an element of surprise"". 
""The episodes are half an hour at most, and each is a treat,"" she added.
ries also has a dreamy, fantastical element alongside the real-life drama, with Hawkins' character often lost in a reverie as she yearns to escape her humdrum life.
Kreiling, whose character's occupation is a bit of a mystery, says: ""It's all very surreal sometimes. But that's also very similar to real life. That's what I think is amazing about this series, it's both truly magical, but also very, very deeply realistic.""
Amadine also has a playboy ex, played by Henry Lloyd-Hughes, who like much in this drama, isn't quite what he first seems.
""I feel like I have a rich televisual history of playing unpleasant people,"" Lloyd-Hughes jokes, having starred in shows such as Marriage, Killing Eve and The Inbetweeners.
""The twist here is that you have every right at the beginning to think of this person as not everyone's cup of tea. And then he actually has this backbone.""
Morgan had starred in Butterworth's Mojo in London's West End and says: ""When you know that the power of that kind of writing is going to make its way on to screens, it's a bit irresistible.""
Although Butterworth is still best known as a playwright, this is not his first foray into television - he was also behind Sky Atlantic's historical fantasy series Britannia.
""I was in completely unchartered territory,"" he explains. ""I've never written characters that existed for that long ever! 
""It was all new but then there were familiarities. There's a kind of curtain up and curtain down in TV. We had ad breaks. So every 15 minutes, you had to come to a type of new moral conclusion. I love the idea of coming back to something and playing this sort of long-form game that can take place over years.""
Like all of Butterworth's work, the series doesn't judge or moralise over the characters' duplicitous behaviour. So what would he like the audience to take away?
""I don't write anything without hoping that people go home with it,"" he explains.
""I don't want them to just walk out and go, 'Where we having dinner?', that's it. I want it to sit with you. I don't have an agenda or a view. I feel like I have a dog in this fight but I don't know what its name is. I just want people to reflect, I guess. in a kind of an unconscious [way].""
Mammals will be available on Prime Video from 11 November."	/news/entertainment-arts-62397373
politics	Council tax: Some second home owners could avoid increase	"Some second home owners could avoid paying up to 300% council tax after proposed regulations were changed. 
From next April, councils in Wales will be able to raise the premium from the current level of 100% for those who own a second property. 
But some properties that are restricted by planning conditions, such as short-term holiday lets, could now be exempt. 
Welsh Conservatives called it a ""major U-turn"" by the Labour-led Welsh government.
Minister for Finance and Local Government Rebecca Evans argued the change would give local authorities ""more flexibility"" and make the system fairer. 
According to government body Stats Wales, there were a total of 23,974 second homes in Wales subject to council tax in 2022.
While local authorities are currently able to charge second home owners double the rate (or 100% more), not all do. 
Gwynedd and Pembrokeshire, for example, which have the largest number of second homes - 3,746 and 3,794 respectively - are charging a 100% premium. 
A 25% increase is added in Conwy and Ceredigion, while it is 50% in Anglesey, Flintshire, Denbighshire and Powys.
roversial new changes would see councils able to charge up to 300% more from next year.
However, a self-catering property could be classified as non-domestic and eligible to pay a non-domestic rate instead if it is made available to let for at least 252 days in any 12-month period, and actually be let for at least 182 days.
But under new proposals, any holiday home that fails to reach this will be exempt and subject to the standard rate of council tax if the property is restricted by planning conditions.
ffected include houses that can only be used as a short-term holiday let or those that cannot be used as someone's main residence.
ges, according to the Welsh government, are intended to ensure the system operates as ""fairly as possible"".
""I recognise the strength of feeling among self-catering operators in response to the changes to the letting criteria, and I have listened to the representations from individual businesses and industry representative bodies,"" said Ms Evans. 
""These changes will give more flexibility to local authorities and will ensure that the contribution property owners make to the communities where they have homes or run businesses is fair.""
Welsh Conservative housing spokeswoman Janet Finch-Saunders called it a ""major U-turn"", adding: ""I have been highlighting for months the madness of the fact that properties which only have planning permission to be holiday lets were going to be charged a second home premium.""
She added: ""What we now need them to realise is that there are genuine holiday lets which cannot reach the 182 threshold because of the seasonal nature of tourism. 
""Rather than leaving the fate of businesses and people's livelihoods to the discretion of local authorities, the 182 barrier needs to be lowered quickly.""
A consultation is open until 22 December. "	/news/uk-wales-63601958
politics	Gerard Hutch trial: No evidence to link accused to murder, court told	"re is no evidence apart from a statement by a former Sinn FÃ©in councillor to link a man accused of murder to a key moment in the gangland crime, a court has heard.
A police officer agreed with the defence there ""wasn't a scintilla of evidence"", apart from his statement, that Jonathan Dowdall gave a hotel room key to Gerry Hutch.
room was used by the murderers of David Byrne in 2016. 
Gerry Hutch has denied murder.
David Byrne was killed during a boxing weigh-in at the Regency Airport Hotel in February 2016.
Det Sgt Patrick O'Toole is giving evidence in a trial within a trial at the Special Criminal Court in Dublin on the admissibility of Dowdall's evidence. 
Dowdall pleaded guilty last month to facilitating the murder.
He had been due to go in trial for murder, along with Gerry Hutch, but is now expected to give evidence for the prosecution.
Lawyers for Gerry Hutch told the trial there was no evidence against their client other than Dowdall's ""say so"" that Gerry Hutch allegedly confessed to him that he was part of the murder team.
ree-judge non-jury court has heard gardaÃ­ (Irish police) secret recordings of conversations between Dowdall and Gerry Hutch in Dowdall's jeep.
Det Sgt O'Toole admitted Dowdall had told untruths in the recordings out of bravado ""to impress Gerry"" and because he was on medication for depression.
He said Dowdall wanted to mediate between the Hutches and their gangland rivals, the Kinahans, before and after the murder of David Byrne.
Det Sgt O'Toole repeated that Dowdall was in fear for his life at the time.
urt also heard that Dowdall told gardaÃ­ he had nothing to do with David Byrne's murder and that he was prepared to go into the witness box to defend himself.
was given by Det Cathal Connolly who took notes of conversations he had with Dowdall and his wife, Patricia.
In his garda statement, Dowdall said there were many lies in his secretly-recorded conversations with Gerry Hutch, the court heard. 
Dowdall said he was trying to tell Gerry Hutch things he wanted to hear and because he was on tablets.
""I talk a lot when I'm nervous or uncomfortable,"" the former Sinn FÃ©in councillor said.
He said he knew nothing about guns or the AK47s used by the killers. He added he didn't even know guns could be traced.
He said he was ""ashamed"" about comments he made about putting a bomb under a named person's mobile home in Wexford.
He also said he lied about shooting at an uncle's house.
Dowdall's solicitor had written to gardaÃ­ to say her client ""was in no doubt he would be murdered"" if word leaked that he was prepared to be a prosecution witness in the murder trial. 
Jenny McGeever said the stress for him and his family was unbearable.
In the letter she criticised their ""tortoise-like"" approach to dealing with this matter.
Lead investigator Det Supt Joseph O'Loughlin told the court he became aware of intelligence that if Dowdall made a witness statement there would be a severe threat to the former Sinn FÃ©in councillor and his family and an attack was likely.
He said it took a week to put in place measures to protect them.
Det Supt O'Loughlin also told the court it was his understanding that the Director of Public Prosecution's (DPP) decision to drop murder charges against Dowdall and the former Sinn FÃ©in's councillor's decision to make a statement and be a prosecution witness were ""not linked"" and ""not related"".
He said it was his understanding that both decisions were separate even though he became aware of them on the same day.
DPP decision cleared the path for Dowdall to be a prosecution witness.
Lawyers for Gerry Hutch put it to Det Supt O'Loughlin that it was ""irrational, illogical and inconceivable"" that the DPP's decision to drop the murder charge against Dowdall and his decision to make a witness statement were not linked."	/news/world-europe-63874703
technology	Hashtags, a viral song and memes empower Iran's protesters	"Anti-government protests have swept across Iran over the past six weeks, with women and schoolgirls at the forefront - burning their headscarves or swinging them in the air while shouting ""Woman, Life, Freedom"". 
monstrations were sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who was detained by the morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab (headscarf) ""inappropriately"".
While thousands of people have been taking to the streets to show their anger at the clerical establishment, many more both inside and outside Iran have been amplifying their calls on social media and spreading awareness.
Getting a hashtag to trend on Twitter has been one of the main ways for Iranians to get their voices heard around the world. 
g #mahsaamini was tweeted and retweeted more than 250 million times in Persian and more than 50 million times in English in the first month after her death.
""People [in Iran] are constantly told that opposition to the system doesn't exist or if it does it is little and will be crushed,"" says Iranian women's rights activist Negin Shiraghaei.
""Hashtags play an important role for people to find each other and recognise their power."" 
In the age of leaderless movements, Ms Shiraghaei says, hashtags could play the role of leaders.
""What do people want from hashtags? Hope, guidance and information,"" she explains. ""That is what the hashtag has done for protesters so far.""
But hashtags and Twitter storms are just some of the ways Iranians hear from each other and make the world take notice.
reaction of Iranian authorities towards the protests has often been violent.
Norway-based Iran Human Rights has reported that at least 253 protesters have been killed by security forces, 34 of them children. 
But even in dark times like this Iranians have tried to use humour to keep their spirits up. 
After an evening news bulletin on state run TV was hacked by protesters and replaced with an image of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in flames, people made memes of the TV presenter's stone-faced reaction. 
ked fun at the presenter by inserting his face into a viral clip of Snoop Dog and Kevin Hart laughing on their talk show.
mandatory hijab laws and what the protesters see as the constant meddling of Islamic laws in their everyday lives have been the targets of much of the criticism on social media.
At the start of the unrest, many Iranians expressed their reasons for protesting in posts on Twitter and Instagram that started with the Persian phrase ""Baraye..."", or ""For the sake of..."".
""For the sake of all the times we had to lower the volume of our music in the car when you guys [morality police] passed by, for all the cassettes we had to hide,"" tweeted Usaneh_dahr. 
Western pop music and Iranian pop music produced outside the country are banned in Iran, and for decades authorities would stop and search cars - and even raid homes - in search of what they called ""indecent music"". 
""For the sake of all the girls who have to bury the dream of ever going to a professional dance school, for myself,"" tweeted Ferferity. 
Dancing in public in Iran is banned, with the exception of some traditional dances performed by men. Women do not have the right to dance or sing in public under any circumstances, although underground women-only dance classes do exist. 
In 2017, the government even banned Zumba exercise classes in gender-segregated gyms, calling them ""un-Islamic"". 
""For my mother tongue,"" said another tweet by RMshii94.
was a reference to the 43-year-old ban on ethnic minorities teaching their own languages in schools in Iran. 
who defy the ban face imprisonment like Zara Mohammadi, a Kurdish language teacher currently serving a five-year sentence for teaching her mother tongue. 
An Iranian pop singer living in Iran, Shervin Hajipour, gathered a number of such tweets and wrote a song about them, entitled ""Baraye..."" 
Instagram page was viewed 40m times in the first 48 hours it was online. 
""Barayeâ¦"" has since become an anthem of the protests and has been played at solidarity rallies all over the world.
Hajipour was arrested on 29 September and released on bail on 4 October. After his release, Hajipour posted an Instagram story saying he regretted that his song was being used by political groups outside the country for ""certain purposes"". 
It is not clear whether he was still in detention when he made the statement and whether he was under duress. 
Activists say Iranian state media routinely broadcast forced ""confessions"" as a means to suppress dissent.
In the past four decades artists inside Iran have found clever ways to bypass the censorship of the ministry of culture and Islamic guidance. 
Foroozan, a digital creator based in Los Angeles, has been posting art on her Instagram page to support the protests inside Iran.
One of her works shows the image of a young woman standing in front of the iconic Si-o-Se Pol, a 17th Century arched bridge in Isfahan, and cutting her ponytail. 
r is an act that has become one of the symbols of the protests in Iran, and women all over the world have been doing the same in solidarity with Iranian women. 
An artist inside Iran called Benyamin created a short video, entitled Unity for Freedom, that has gone viral on social media.
It shows the gloved hand of a member of the security forces wielding a truncheon and beating the other hands around him. However, his hand is eventually overcome by the other hands. The video ends with his hand joining theirs in making a victory sign.
Such online material has meant that the protesters' voices have not been silenced, even as the clampdown continues on and off the streets in Iran
""In a country where the people have no media, social media has become the medium of the people,"" says Negin Shiraghaei. ""It is a decentralised media that allows people to be heard and seen."""	/news/world-middle-east-63456599
politics	Stephen Doughty: Police 'standing by its decision' in MP's diazepam case	"South Wales Police says it is ""standing by its original decision"", after it was asked to re-examine why it treated a man cautioned for supplying diazepam to an MP differently to the politician himself.
Labour's Stephen Doughty admitted last year asking Byron Long for the prescription-only drug on one occasion.
Mr Doughty has not been cautioned.
Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) upheld some of Mr Long's complaints in an initial review in May.
South Wales Police has now told BBC Wales it has ""reviewed its investigation"" and has ""replied to Mr Long clarifying and standing by its original decision"".
An IOPC spokesperson said ""we are aware that South Wales Police has responded to the complainant following their further investigation"".
Mr Long, the Labour Party and Mr Doughty declined to comment. 
Byron Long, 63, had complained to South Wales Police, which told him it took no action against Mr Doughty, the MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, because the allegation he possessed a controlled drug ""cannot be proved in these circumstances"".
, in a letter to Mr Long, the IOPC said this ""does not appear to be borne out by the available evidence"".
Evidence suggested an ""inconsistency in the manner in which you were dealt with by South Wales Police, following your admission of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug, and Mr Doughty's apparent acknowledgement regarding obtaining a controlled drug, which did not result in further investigative lines of enquiry"".
IOPC had said a police investigation ""should address the apparent difference in the outcomes experienced by Mr Long and Mr Doughty"".
It added that the police ""may wish to take into consideration Mr Long's belief that Mr Doughty was treated differently due to his status as an MP, and also due to a personal relationship with Alun Michael"". 
Mr Michael is South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner and a senior Labour Party figure.
Mr Doughty denied Mr Long's claim that he gave him pills at up to 20 meetings in a Cardiff coffee shop, saying it only happened once.
In May 2021, the MP apologised ""unreservedly for any error he made"".
Via a spokesperson, he said at the time that he asked his ""friend"" Mr Long for ""a few spare diazepam"" in 2019 ahead of a flight because he had not been able to see a GP.
kesman explained last year: ""To the best of his recollection, at the time he was panicking, had been unable to get to a GP for an appointment, and as a friend who he regularly shared confidential personal mental health worries and anxieties with, asked Byron if he had a few spare diazepam, which he had previously been prescribed for such circumstances, and taken without any issues.""
In October 2021, Mr Doughty was cleared of breaking the MPs' code of conduct.
In a report, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards said the MP ""was complicit in a criminal offence"", but that the police took no action and that there was only evidence that he received diazepam once.
Mr Michael has also denied any involvement in the case.
Possession of diazepam, which is a class C drug without a prescription, carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.
It is available on prescription only and is used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and fits."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63502527

"Millions of people are facing travel disruption this week as the biggest walkout on the railways in 30 years takes place in a row over pay and conditions. With limited services running, what does this mean for passengers using stations in Ipswich and Stevenage?
Divya Kasturi is travelling from Stevenage to Cambridge but says the disruption is going to affect her planned journeys to London for the rest of the week.
""I'm really bracing myself and thinking of other options. I'm a bit anxious and I'm really panicking about tomorrow and the week ahead,"" she says.
She says the strike action is ""not a good decision because it's affecting so many people"".
""I would have really appreciated if they had come up with an alternative solution.""
She says wanting fairer pay and conditions is the ""same for all of us in our world of work"", adding: ""I wish I could go on a strike but I can't.""
Jill Tuck, who has been visiting her mum in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, is heading home to Bingley in West Yorkshire early to avoid the disruption.
She says she is feeling ""annoyed"" by the industrial action.
""It's not going to hurt anybody but the public,"" she says.
""Everyone is having a struggle and it's bad that they are doing this at this time.""

business	Union rejects Rolls-Royce Â£2,000 living-cost bonus	"A union representing Rolls-Royce workers has rejected the offer of a Â£2,000 one-off payment from the firm to help its staff with the rising cost of living.
Of the 14,000 staff at Rolls-Royce who were eligible for the payment, 11,000 members are unionised.
Unite said the offer ""falls far short of the real cost of living challenges which our members are experiencing"". 
But Rolls-Royce said the offer was ""fair"" and ""a good deal"" for staff.
ump sum, which was intended for junior management and shop floor staff, was due to begin being rolled out in August, starting with the 3,000 non-unionised staff before being paid to the remaining 11,000 unionised workers.
Unite's regional secretary Paresh Patel said the union was still in negotiations with Rolls-Royce about the pay offer.
News of the offer emerged on Monday night, and was later confirmed by Rolls-Royce.
However, Unite said: ""The fact that Rolls-Royce has made this announcement in the way that it has certainly in our view undermines the trade union and the negotiating position that should be between the employer and the unions on this matter.""
Rolls-Royce had also offered workers a 4% increase in pay, back-dated to March. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson had told the BBC it would be ""the highest annual pay rise for at least a decade"" for its shop floor staff. 
But Unite said it would also reject that offer of a 4% pay rise.
re are ongoing discussions with unions about a pay settlement for 2022-2023, Rolls-Royce's spokesperson said, and the cost of living issue is to be a factor in those negotiations.
In response to Unite's rejection of the offer, the spokesperson said: ""This is a good deal for our colleagues that is fair and competitive, with an immediate cash lump sum to help them through the current exceptional economic climate. 
""We will continue to talk to our people.""
Meanwhile, around 115,000 Royal Mail workers are voting on strike action in a similar row over pay.
Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents many Royal Mail staff, said it would be claiming for an ""inflation-based, no-strings pay award"", adding that Royal Mail's offer of a 2% pay award was ""miles away from where inflation is, totally inadequate"". 
Pay rates and measures to help UK staff have been increasing as businesses have been seeking to recruit and retain staff, after official figures showed there were fewer unemployed people than job vacancies for the first time since records began. 
Earlier this month, Lloyds Bank staff were offered a Â£1,000 lump sum to help with rising costs, after Unite the Union demonstrated outside its annual general meeting.
Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - currently stands at 9%, and is expected to increase again later this year.
It seems one-off cost of living payments are gaining in popularity among employers - but are they a short-term fix to a long-term issue?
ure of inflation means that while the rate of price rises may slow next year, it is extremely unlikely that the cost of living will actually drop. Prices are almost certainly not going to fall.
Yet, these payments are not embedded in future wages, unlike a regular pay increase. As employees continue to find it tough, will there be pressure on bosses to make these payments a permanent part of pay next year and beyond?
re is undoubtedly an awareness among businesses that workers, particularly the lower-paid, need more financial help at the moment to cover their bills.
But perhaps this eye-catching tactic of one-off payments is directed more at another issue - the retention and recruitment of staff.
Rolls-Royce was badly impacted by the global coronavirus pandemic, which hit demand for its aircraft engines as international air travel ground to a halt. 
In 2020 it announced plans to cut its global workforce by 9,000 by the end of this year, with 3,000 of those jobs going in the UK. At the time it said it would take ""several years"" for the industry to recover from the pandemic. 
In the first year of Covid, Rolls-Royce made a loss of Â£4bn because of the collapse in air travel, however it returned to profit in 2021.
Staff shortages are also putting pressure on firms to raise wages.
Earlier this month, Morrisons said it would increase pay for its store workers as UK supermarkets battle for staff in the face of increasing competition in the sector.
Rival chains Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda have also announced pay rises for their workers this year."	/news/business-61874786
entertainment	Piet Mondrian artwork displayed upside down for 75 years	"An artwork by the abstract Dutch painter Piet Mondrian has been hanging upside down in various galleries for 75 years, an art historian has said.
Despite the recent discovery, the work, entitled New York City I, will continue to be displayed the wrong way up to avoid it being damaged.
1941 picture was first put on display at New York's MoMA in 1945.
It has hung at the art collection of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia in DÃ¼sseldorf since 1980.
Curator Susanne Meyer-BÃ¼ser noticed the longstanding error when researching the museum's new show on the artist earlier this year, but warned it could disintegrate if it was hung the right side up now.
New York City I is an adhesive-tape version of the similarly named New York City artwork by the same artist. 
""The thickening of the grid should be at the top, like a dark sky,"" Meyer-BÃ¼ser told The Guardian, about the unfinished and unsigned red, blue and yellow striped lattice artwork.
""Once I pointed it out to the other curators, we realised it was very obvious. It is very likely the picture is the wrong way around,"" she added when contacted by the BBC.
ms to bear this theory out, as the similarly-named New York City, which is on display at Paris's Centre Pompidou, displays a thickening of lines at the top, rather than the bottom.
Furthermore, a photograph of the influential Dutchman's studio, taken days after his death shows the same picture sitting on an easel the other way up. 
mage was published in the American lifestyle magazine Town and Country in June 1944.
Mondrian, who was born in the Utrecht region of The Netherlands in 1872, is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century, and a pioneer of the modern abstract style, minimalism and expressionism.
As the co-founder of the De Stijl art group and movement, and in search of ""universal beauty"", he evolved a non-representational form which he termed Neoplasticism. 
Moving to Paris in 1911, he experimented in Cubism, but his name is these days synonymous with modernism.
His work had a huge influence, not only on the art world but also in the fields of design, architecture and fashion.
According to the DÃ¼sseldorf gallery, His recently re-visited series of New York City paintings from 1941 and 1942, shortly before his death aged 71, was seen as ""a revolution in Mondrian's strict concept of Gestalt"" [shape].
gallery describes Referring to New York City I as ""a lively, dynamic rhythm of coloured, red, blue and yellow stripes [which] took the place of the radically reduced pictorial language with the geometric structure and the reduction to the primary colours as well as black and white."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63423811
business	Without a 'distraction', who pays the bills?	"It was a 'distraction', said Kwasi Kwarteng about plans to scrap the 45p rate of income tax for higher earners. 
Removing the top rate of income tax, outside of Scotland, saved those who pay it an average of Â£10,000, and 'the optics' - how it looks, politically - were beyond inept.
was while price inflation was heading towards 11%, the public sector is embroiled in pay battles, and a few days before domestic energy bills were to go up 27%.
So what was it distracting us from? Well, the rest of the tax cutting package, of course, adding up to a whopping Â£43bn of the Â£45bn unfunded tax cuts in the chancellor's mini-budget of 23 September. The top rate brought in an extra Â£2bn.
So it was a big and expensive political U-turn, but didn't make much difference to the underlying questions of how to pay for what remains of the plan.
It also distracted us from the energy price guarantee, and its equivalent for business, costing us... we have no idea how much.  It's the blankest of blank cheques.
So having been distracted, let's look again at the remaining tax cuts.  The plan for raising corporation tax on profits from 19% to 25% has been reversed, as Liz Truss said she would do during the leadership campaign in the summer.
Likewise, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak's move to use higher National Insurance Contributions (1.25% more for employers as well as employees) to fund the transition to more generous social care (in England, at least) is being reversed, taking effect next month, only seven months after it was introduced.
wo further measures don't affect Scotland directly: a cut in the basic rate of Westminster's income tax regime from 20 pence in the pound to 19 pence, and a deep cut in the tax take from the transactions tax on homes, known in England and Northern Ireland as Stamp Duty Land Tax.
All that goes ahead, unless political pressure comes back from the Conservative Party. And there's far less reason for it to do so. Until, that is, the other side of the ledger is published.
We're now told the 'medium-term fiscal plan' - the sums that show Kwasi Kwarteng has his borrowing under control - will be published earlier than planned. It was to have been on 23 November. It's now looking more like this month, with an announcement about the date expected on Tuesday. 
It's going to be busy for the number-crunchers at the Office for Budget Responsibility, who normally require 10 weeks to work on such government 'fiscal events'. Publication of their rough calculations was offered but rejected by Kwasi Kwarteng ahead of his mini-budget, at enormous cost to his credibility on fiscal discipline.
figures they'll be working with are the choices the Chancellor makes to fund his tax cuts and energy support package. 
may chop and change over the next few weeks, and the OBR has to chop and change with them, until they reach a pre-agreed cut-off point.
A big splurge of borrowing would make it much harder to reach the promise the new chancellor made to the Conservative conference, of getting debt down as a share of Gross Domestic Product - Britain's total economic output in a year.  It sounds technical, and it is. But it's the key performance indicator that the Treasury has chosen to be judged by. 
rnative is to take a chainsaw to public spending. To many Conservatives in Birmingham, they may like the sound of that, at least until they see the possible or likely consequences. 
Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) admitted that he lacks the imagination to see how deep cuts can be made, after the sharp reductions of the past 12 years.
NHS? It's already struggling with backlogs and staff shortages, and is one of the new prime minister's top three priorities.
? Sticking to the 'triple lock' means it will go up by price inflation next year, and its recipients have a tendency to vote. Indeed, they have a tendency to vote Conservative, but they are not to be taken for granted.
Welfare benefits? A target that some would like in Conservative ranks, but Tory MPs who have already signalled their intentions as the backbench awkward squad - now with a licence to rebel against a weakened leadership - have indicated this is not a good time to be targeting those who are already least well off.
Education? Policing? None of them are easy choices for spending cuts in order to pay for tax cuts. It comes back once more to local councils, perhaps. They have taken the brunt of the cuts, also in Scotland where Whitehall's squeeze has been passed on for Holyrood to apply, and their services have been hacked back.
However, if you are Kwasi Kwarteng, you square the circle with more economic growth, bringing in more tax revenue. Simple.
But there are several question marks over that. It is a gamble. It may not work. Just one of the problems is that tax cuts put the foot on the economic accelerator, meaning the Bank of England has to press on the brake all the harder, by putting up the cost of borrowing.
Supposing it does work, how long will this take? And if at first it doesn't succeed, how often will Downing Street try and try again? How long can borrowing take the strain when the bond markets already think this looks risky, and price UK debt accordingly?
If there is growth in the economy, Mr Kwarteng has made clear that more revenue will fuel the fire for further tax cuts. We could expect that to include the top rate for top earners. 
By implication, that would mean a continuing relative squeeze on the public sector, reducing its share of national income, where pay pressure is already being stoked and where demographic pressures are rising inexorably.
Mr Kwarteng's Growth Plan goes on to lean heavily on a series of measures that have not yet been announced, on de-regulating the economy to help business grow. Many of those measures may not apply in Scotland, making it more difficult to co-ordinate the flagship Downing Street policy of low-tax, low-regulation Investment Zones.
But what we are yet to see is the reaction from those who like the regulations we've amassed over the years - on employment, the environment, agriculture, building on green belt land. Whether or not they were imposed by Brussels, even post-Brexit Britain has people who buy into them, and will surely fight for them.
r part of this mini-budget - from which we've been 'distracted' - is help with energy bills. Because that has widespread support, so far as it goes, across politics, business and anti-poverty campaigners, there isn't much discussion of the package we've got.  And which of us does not like government absorbing the risk of prices remaining very high and very volatile?
But it might be worth taking a moment to recall what the International Monetary Fund, Moody's credit rating agency and others said last week: the flat rate cap on unit prices is not targeted at those who need help most. Instead it's most generous - in cash terms - to those, in big homes and those running gas-guzzling business.
So it increases inequality, which those overseas observers already see as a weakness of the British economy.
It also masks the price signal of higher energy prices, as an incentive to use less or to shift to alternative sources of heat and power.
We're reminded of that by the message from energy regulator Ofgem that Britain could be heading for a gas supply emergency this winter, meaning that some industry's may have to power down or switch off, and one of those industries could be the gas-fired electricity generators.
Of course, Liz Truss blithely promised, while a leadership candidate, that there would be no rationing on her watch. That's another failure to understand markets, and her lack of her control over them, that could come back and bite the Prime Minister.
But as October chill, rain and wind billow in from the Atlantic, it's not too late to turn down the thermostat in Downing Street, as an example to others. 
In any case, the politics of recent days have surely been generating enough renewable heat to make quite a dent in Britain's demand for natural gas."	/news/uk-scotland-63128912
technology	Russian mercenary videos 'top 1bn views' on TikTok	"kTok is hosting dozens of videos that glorify violence by Russia's Wagner Group of mercenaries and they have been viewed more than a billion times, according to a new report.
Wagner has sent mercenaries into Ukraine in big numbers.
US-based NewsGuard, which focuses on online misinformation, says some of the videos appear to show the execution of a former Russian mercenary.
kTok has said it will act against any content violating its policies.
NewsGuard said it had identified 160 videos on the short-video platform that ""allude to, show, or glorify acts of violence"" by the mercenary group, founded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin.
Fourteen of those videos showed full or partial footage of the apparent killing of former Russian mercenary Yevgeny Nuzhin which saw high engagement within days of being uploaded last month, it said.
Analysts said one video of the murder was viewed at least 900,000 times before it was taken down. TikTok is owned by China-based firm ByteDance.
Nuzhin had been serving a jail term for murder but described how he had been recruited by Wagner and was then captured by the Ukrainian military. He told Ukrainian journalists he had switched sides voluntarily and denounced the mercenary group.
It is thought he was then part of a prisoner exchange and within days a gruesome video involving a sledgehammer was posted on a Wagner-linked channel on the Telegram messaging app.
NewsGuard found that TikTok's algorithm appeared to push users towards violent Wagner Group content. 
When an analyst searched for the term ""Wagner"", TikTok's search bar suggested searches for ""Wagner execution"" and ""Wagner sledgehammer"".  The same search in Russian resulted in the suggestions ""Wagner PMC"", ""Wagner sledgehammer"" and ""Wagner orchestra"". Wagner refers to its fighters as ""musicians"".
NewsGuard also found that videos could be found on TikTok showing another Wagner murder involving an army deserter in Syria in 2017 and that they had reached millions of users. 
group said it had also identified other music videos on the platform that advocated violence against Ukrainians, including calls to kill Ukrainians claiming they were ""Nazis"". 
Responding to the report, a TikTok spokesperson said there was ""no place for hateful or violent content on our platform"". Many of the videos identified by NewsGuard were no longer available on the platform by Thursday.
""Our Community Guidelines clearly outline that we do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or share attacks or slurs based on people's nationality or other protected characteristics. We will take action on content found to violate these policies,"" TikTok said. 
Wagner started out as a shadowy Russian mercenary group and in 2014 went to eastern Ukraine to help Russian proxy forces oust the Ukrainian military.
It has also been active in Syria and several African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Last week the European Parliament called for it to be added to the EU's list of terrorist organisations.
Watch: Russian mercenary group recruits detainees
For years Yevgeny Prigozhin denied he had anything to do with Wagner, until September when he finally admitted founding the group.
Once know as ""Putin's chef"" because of his catering fortune, he appeared in recent videos recruiting inmates in Russian prisons for the war in Ukraine. 
Yevgeny Nuzhin's family knew nothing of his recruitment for the war, although before he died he told Ukrainian journalists he and the other prison recruits were merely ""cannon fodder""."	/news/world-europe-63820437
business	Why business is still optimistic about Hong Kong	"On a cloudy June day, the Jumbo Floating Restaurant was towed out of Hong Kong's Aberdeen harbour. 
giant six-storey structure - in the shape of a Chinese imperial palace - crept past yachts a fraction of its size earlier this month before a foghorn signalled its entry into the open sea. 
mega restaurant, which could house 2,300 diners at a time, had spent nearly a half a century in Hong Kong's waters. It drew visitors like the Queen, Richard Branson and Tom Cruise, and featured in multiple Cantonese and Hollywood films. 
But for years, losses had been mounting, and the pandemic dealt a fatal blow.
For some, the restaurant's departure was symbolic of what was happening in Hong Kong. Both had faced a difficult few years and now Jumbo, much like the appeal of Hong Kong as a great place to do business, was floating away.
An unyielding zero Covid policy, which Hong Kong shares with mainland China, has battered an economy reliant on global business, finance and trade. Stringent travel regulations and intermittent lockdowns have kept tourists away, decimated small and medium businesses, and isolated ""Asia's world city"" from the rest of the globe.
follows several years of disruption - massive pro-democracy protests in 2019, a National Security Law that critics said spelled the ""end of Hong Kong"" as they knew it, and a crackdown on free speech. 
Business owners say these events have transformed the city's population.
""It [business] was very highly oriented towards the expat market. Hong Kong to New York, New York to Hong Kong, London,"" says Vinny Lauria, who runs a number of Hong Kong restaurants.
But, he adds, the restaurant business has ""wisened up"" with the increased arrival of wealthy mainland Chinese in the city. 
""Strategy has changed immensely over the last 10 years,"" he says. 
first time that Hong Kong's future as a rich yet edgy business hub has been doubted. 
Hong Kong had long flourished as a financial powerhouse. And since Britain returned the former colony to China in 1997, the city had become a gateway for foreign companies to do business with China.
It had major advantages over regional competitors because of its sophisticated financial system, a transparent rule of law, English-speaking workers and links around the world. 
But ahead of the handover in 1997, Fortune magazine published a cover story  - ""The death of Hong Kong"" - lamenting that ""the naked truth about Hong Kong's future can be summed up in two words: It's over.""
Both foreign observers and many locals feared that Beijing's influence would increase immediately, and that Chinese soldiers would soon be roaming the city's streets, arresting people. Western newspapers also predicted that annual commemorations of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre - a taboo topic in China - would be banned.
But it would be another 20 years before Hongkongers' freedoms were threatened - several pro-democracy leaders and activists, and even a media tycoon are behind bars now. And events marking the Tiananmen Square anniversary are no longer permitted. 
But those working in business and finance are still bullish about the city. In fact, Hong Kong's economy has doubled since 1997. 
""When you're talking about Asian markets from an integrity standpoint, Hong Kong is ahead of China,"" says Drew Bernstein, an accountant who has been auditing Chinese companies for decades. 
""If you have a financial market without integrity, it's more like a casino.""  
Financial markets opening up in mainland China did prompt some Fortune 500 companies to move to Shanghai, but Hong Kong remains one of the world's top 10 stock exchanges by market capitalisation. 
And the city continues to rank highly among global financial centres for business environment, human capital, infrastructure and overall reputation.
""I've been through this movie many, many times, the ending is always the same,"" says property tycoon Allan Zeman. 
While people left Hong Kong in 1997 thinking it was the end of the city's prospects, he says what they forget is that China is part of Hong Kong's appeal and what it offers to the business world. 
""People are in Hong Kong because of China. One or two businesses might leave. I've been here for 50 years, I'm not going anywhere.""
But data shows that people are indeed leaving Hong Kong in record numbers. 
Mid-2021 saw the largest number of people relocating since mid-1966, according to figures from the city's census and statistics department.
Mercer's chief executive in Hong Kong, Vicki Fan, says a high turnover isn't uncommon for a market like Hong Kong, especially in the wake of Covid, but she admits that a lot of people are moving.
Ms Fan points to international schools as proof - formerly competitive campuses are now opening up spots for local students.
re were also capital outflows of more than $100 billion last year, for only the second time since 1997. And investments into Hong Kong dipped significantly in 2021. 
""Hong Kong will continue to be a very rich city even if foreign executives move out, or refuse to locate there because there are enormous numbers of very wealthy Chinese and powerful Chinese companies who are enthusiastic to move there,"" said William H Overholt, a senior research fellow at the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. 
Experts also point to Hong Kong's role as a financial hub in the Greater Bay area - a project that is connecting 11 cities in southern China with Hong Kong at the centre. The zone's combined GDP already matches that of South Korea. 
""The future of Hong Kong is the Greater Bay Area. You can get from Hong Kong to Shenzhen in 14 minutes. The joke is that it's faster to go to Shenzhen than other people's houses in Hong Kong,"" Mr Zeman said.
While Hong Kong is expected to become more integrated with China, experts say it still won't lose its unique place in the financial world.
""For many Westerners, it's going to feel like another Chinese city. For the Chinese - individuals and companies - Hong Kong is still this wonderful airlock to the world from outside the mainland. It's where the legal system is predictable, political pressures on business are a lot less than they are on the mainland,"" Mr Overholt said.
And as the US increasingly turns away Chinese companies from its stock markets, Hong Kong will benefit. Around 100 mainland firms are at risk of delisting in the US.
Mr Bernstein believes they will attract more investor interest in Hong Kong than in London or New York.
""There aren't a lot of places for them to go,"" he said.
""It's still a market that companies can go to that has deep sources of capital. Markets like Hong Kong offer advantages that Asian companies can't get in the US,"" he adds. 
""Asian markets understand the risk of a company not run by supply and demand but by governments. Today the reality is the largest companies in the world are run by governments.""
ge is already visible: Of the 2,500 companies currently listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, more than 40% are China-based and account for over three-quarters of the exchange's capitalisation.
""The strength of Hong Kong is being part of Chinaâ¦ the first 25 years was an experiment, in the next 25 years we will reap the benefits. Hong Kong will continue to be one of the world's great cities,"" Mr Zeman told the BBC.
Experts argue that China doesn't need another Shanghai or Shenzhen, successful business hubs - so far from becoming another Chinese city, Hong Kong, they say, is likely to be the capital of a Chinese-led global economic empire. 
It continues to be a gateway to China, and its role as China's gateway to the world is also under way.

technology	Data watchdog reprimands government over pandemic WhatsApp use	"Department of Health has been reprimanded over ministers' and officials' use of messaging apps and private email during the pandemic.
Using WhatsApp and other apps had meant information on the handling of the pandemic could have been lost, the Information Commissioner's Office said.
It has asked government to carry out a review of the use of private messaging, 
government told BBC News the ICO had found the channels it used had been ""lawful"".
But its use of encrypted apps and private email has been criticised, as messages might not be provided to people making Freedom of Information requests.
Last year, campaigners brought a case to the High Court, saying these services made it easier to delete information and cover up possible wrongdoing.
But in April judges decided the law on keeping public records said ""nothing"" about using personal devices for government business.
ruled using autodelete software was lawful.
Also last year, the then information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, launched an investigation into the use of these private channels by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) during the pandemic.
At the time, Ms Denham said: ""My worry is that information in private email accounts or messaging services is forgotten, overlooked, autodeleted or otherwise not available when a Freedom of Information request is later made.""
results of this inquiry have now been published in a report, Behind the screens.
re was, it says, ""extensive"" use of private correspondence channels by ministers and staff. 
Staff used:
And the DHSC's policies and procedures were inconsistent with existing policy on the use of private email.
Using private channels of communication did not in itself constitute a breach of either Freedom of Information or data-protection rules, the report says, if there were ""sufficient controls in place"" to allow information to be given when requested.
""The investigation found, however, that such controls were lacking,"" the ICO said.
report also questions the security of private messaging channels, while noting instant messaging brought ""some real operational benefits"" during the pandemic.
As a result of its investigation, the ICO issued a reprimand requiring the DHSC to improve its ""handling of personal information through private correspondence channels and ensure information is kept secure"".
Current information commissioner John Edwards said he understood the value of instant communication but ""public officials should be able to show their workings, for both record-keeping purposes and to maintain public confidence"". 
""That is how trust in those decisions is secured and lessons are learned for the future,"" he said.
""The broader point is making sure the Freedom of Information Act keeps working to ensure public authorities remain accountable to the people they serve.""
UK Covid-19 Inquiry, chaired by Baroness Hallett, will also consider how information was recorded by the government during the pandemic.
government told BBC News it would carefully consider the ICO report but was glad it had made clear the correspondence channels used were lawful.
""Ministers and officials had to work at extraordinary pace during the pandemic and the use of modern technology was necessary to deliver important public services that saved lives,"" an official said.
And it had already started reviewing the policy for using non-corporate communication channels.
But Iain Overton, of public-service journalist body The Citizens, which brought the earlier unsuccessful High Court action, told BBC News government had been ruling ""more and more in the shadows, refusing to acknowledge they are increasingly running the country on personal, encrypted messaging systems"".
""This poses not just a problem for journalists - Freedom of Information Act requests for such messages are consistently refused,"" he said.
""But it also means that future historians will look back at this era with despair.
""Correspondence between ministers, special advisors and party donors will be long deleted and data on personal phones lost to the rivers of time."""	/news/technology-62124094

Biden administration began sending free at-home tests in January, but stopped in September after more than 600 million tests were distributed because Congress did not approve the extra funding needed for the programme to continue.
But the government is now using funding left over from the American Rescue Plan, the Covid relief bill that was passed last year, to pay for the tests, a US official told the BBC's US partner CBS.

White House said it hoped to encourage Americans to take at-home tests when they are symptomatic, before and after travelling for the holidays and when visiting vulnerable individuals.
Covid cases, hospital visits and deaths have all begun to rise in recent weeks. 
Some cities are calling on Americans to wear masks again in indoor spaces to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, while White House officials have urged Americans to get the latest Covid and flu jabs.
Only 13.5% of those aged five and older in the US have received the updated coronavirus shot targeting the omicron variant, according to the CDC.

business	EasyJet cancels 80 flights as travel disruption continues	"Airlines including EasyJet and Wizz Air have cancelled dozens of flights as UK air travel disruption continues.
EasyJet said it had cut 80 flights on Sunday, and apologised to customers for the disruption.
ransport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC the aviation industry cut too many jobs during the coronavirus pandemic and it must not oversell flights.
He said he wanted airlines to automatically compensate passengers.
Passengers have faced a raft of UK flight cancellations causing disruptions for many families on half-term holidays.
-year-old Noah and his younger sister Beau won't be in school on Monday morning after a cancelled EasyJet flight left their family stranded in Dalyan, Turkey.
r mother, Emma, a hairdresser has had to cancel clients by text. 
family of six, including Emma's parents, spent 10 hours on Saturday night at the airport waiting to see if they would be able to fly out as planned, before finally being bussed back to the hotel at 4.30am.
EasyJet offered them a flight on Thursday to Liverpool, but their car is parked at Gatwick.
""The [EasyJet] app literally says rearrange your flight or get a refund,"" says father Scott. ""So we've just spend Â£3,000 on a flight home tomorrow night... flying to Stanstead."" 
EasyJet said it had cancelled about 80 flights on Sunday ""due to the ongoing challenging operating environment"".
""We are very sorry and fully understand the disruption this will have caused for our customers,"" the airline said, adding it was doing everything possible to get passengers to their destinations.
It said it had extended its customer service opening hours from 07:00 to 23:00, and was helping those affected find hotel accommodation.
Mr Shapps told BBC One's Sunday Morning programme that labour shortages were behind the travel disruption, resulting in airlines ""finding it difficult to get people on board"".
""When someone has bought a ticket for a flight, they've every right to expect that flight will take off, and not find that flight has been cancelled,"" he said. 
""Airlines should be cautious about not overselling those flights, [and] where there are problems they need to fix them quickly."" 
He said the government had provided Â£8bn of support to the sector during the pandemic, along with furlough support, so decisions to cut staff had been made by the industry.
Mr Shapps added that airlines had ""cut too deep"" during the coronavirus pandemic.
""Clearly [the airlines] have been taken by surprise by the way in which people have returned to travel after two years of being locked down,"" he said.
He added that he wanted a ""proper charter"" for passengers so they could get ""quick and straightforward compensation or be put on other flights"".
Mr Shapps said he wanted a similar system to ""Delay Repay"" train passenger refunds ""where it's an automated process"".
However, he again rejected the idea of easing aviation labour shortages by relaxing immigration requirements.
Airlines have called on the government to issue special immigration visas to allow them to recruit overseas workers in the short term, as was done for the haulage and meat processing industries.

""What we don't want is this spring misery turned into summer misery,"" he said. 
However, Mr Shapps said after the government eased immigration rules in the haulage industry only 27 lorry drivers had come over from the European Union to help ease the chronic shortage, which instead had been alleviated by government measures.
Gatwick Airport said that 52 departures and 30 arrivals were cancelled on Sunday.
majority were EasyJet flights, but British Airways, Wizz Air and Vueling were also affected.
Flights from Barcelona, Nice, Madrid, Belfast, Geneva, Corfu, Faro in Portugal and Glasgow were among those cancelled.
A Gatwick spokesperson said the airport was ""operating normally"" but would be busy with 830 flights.
ravel expert Simon Calder said that on a typical day you would expect to see half a dozen flights being cancelled to and from the UK, with those spread over all airlines.
He said in addition about 3,000 passengers heading for Luton on Sunday had been diverted after a power failure affected air traffic control systems.
British Airways declined to comment.
Wizz Air issued a statement saying it was doing as much as it could to help passengers reach their destinations. It said several things were causing ""operational instability"" in the travel industry, including staff shortages within air traffic control, ground operations and baggage handling, security and across airports.
It offered customers affected its ""sincere apologies"" and said they would be offered alternative flights with Wizz Air, a full refund or 120% in airline credit, which it aimed to process within one week.

politics	Brexit: Call for rethink on ditching thousands of EU laws	"UK government plans to scrap thousands of EU laws at the end of 2023 should be reconsidered, according to a cross-party group of Senedd members.
Welsh Parliament's legislation committee heard the legal disruption could harm vital health, environmental and agricultural regulation.
mmittee raises its concerns about the Retained EU Law Bill in a letter to UK Business Secretary Grant Shapps.
UK ministers say they want to take ""advantage of the benefits of Brexit"".
EU laws were copied into domestic law when the UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, and kept during a transition period that ended in January 2021.
re have been moves away from some of those laws in areas including immigration since then, but thousands of regulations - known as retained EU law - are still in force.
Retained EU Law Bill, currently being considered by MPs at Westminster, contains a ""sunset clause"" that means that, by the end of next year, some laws could expire automatically.
Welsh NHS Confederation, representing health bodies, has warned that rules on information consumers must be given about allergens and nutritional content in food, for example, could be lost ""due to a lack of oversight"".
UK Environmental Law Association highlighted a ""significant risk that the substance as well as the coherence of environmental law and policy in Wales (and throughout the UK) will be undermined and weakened"".
And farmers' union NFU Cymru emphasised ""we run the risk of discarding important regulatory protections"". 
Counsel general Mick Antoniw MS, Welsh government senior adviser on legal matters, told the Senedd last month there were ""something like 2,400 pieces of legislation"" involved.
""Basically, this would almost completely overwhelm not only the UK government's legislative programme, but ours as well, if we were to try and address this,"" he said.
UK government is seeking Welsh Parliament consent for its plans, because they concern matters the Senedd and the Welsh government are responsible for.
In his letter to Grant Shapps, also addressed to Industry and Investment Security Minister Nusrat Ghani, Senedd legislation committee chair Huw Irranca-Davies wrote: ""Stakeholders have expressed to us deep concerns about the extent of the task at hand and the significant pressure caused by, what is seen by many as, a completely unnecessary sunset date of 31 December 2023.""
Labour Senedd member also says his committee ""can see no reason why the power to extend the sunset date"" contained in the legislation ""should not also be granted to the Welsh ministers for devolved matters"".
A UK government spokesperson said they were ""committed to taking full advantage of the benefits of Brexit, which is why we are pushing ahead with our Retained EU Law Bill"". 
""We continue to engage with the devolved administrations on the progress and policy of the bill, supporting them as they review any retained EU law that falls within their devolved powers. 
""There are no plans to change the sunset deadline."" "	/news/uk-wales-politics-64051226

politics	Rishi Sunak aims to bring factions together in cabinet reshuffle	"Rishi Sunak has appointed his team of top ministers, on his first day as the UK's prime minister.
In a key speech outside No 10, he said he wanted to bring the country and party together, promising economic stability and confidence.
reshuffle saw some predictable choices, and some that have surprised MPs. 
""Unity, experience and continuity in some really key roles,"" are the themes No 10 say they wanted to convey.
So, what can we read into who is staying, who is going, and what it all means?
No 10's message is echoed by the former director of communications for David Cameron, Sir Craig Oliver, who said: ""Unity is the watchword of this reshuffle. It's clear each part of the party will feel represented in some way. 
""Mr Sunak's also not exiled big beasts to the backbenches where they can cause trouble - like Truss did with Michael Gove."" 
Another of the notable elements of this reshuffle is the stability in three of the top jobs: Jeremy Hunt as chancellor, James Cleverly as foreign secretary and Ben Wallace as defence secretary.
kely intended to be a clear message that, particularly during the war in Ukraine and economic turmoil of the last few months, Mr Sunak wants to reassure MPs he can offer stability.
Mr Hunt ditched most of the tax cuts former PM Liz Truss brought in, reverting the economic plan to one more closely resembling Mr Sunak's proposals during the summer leadership contest.
He and Mr Sunak have talked about the need for ""difficult decisions"", something we are likely to hear more about on 31 October when they set out the government's next budget. 
As well as a signal of stability, keeping Boris Johnson ally Mr Wallace as defence secretary - and Mr Cleverly as foreign secretary - is an olive branch to some of the senior MPs who did not back Mr Sunak.
""This cabinet brings the talents of the party together"", said a No 10 source, speaking about the conclusion of the reshuffle.
""It reflects a unified party and a cabinet with significant experience, ensuring that at this uncertain time there is continuity at the heart of the government.""
rd work would begin now and the new cabinet would ""deliver for the British people"". 
A senior government source told the BBC Mr Cleverly's appointment would allow ""stability at the Foreign Office"" and means ""continuity for the UK's relationships around the world"". 
Indeed, Mr Cleverly's social media feeds, as the reshuffle progressed, were full of pictures of him calling foreign government representatives. 
, though, shows Penny Mordaunt paid the price for not dropping out of the leadership race sooner. 
It was widely reported she had been vying for the foreign secretary role. She remains as Leader of the House of Commons, the job that ensures government legislation gets through Parliament.
One potential clash coming down the line, however, is over defence spending. 
Mr Wallace has made it clear in the past he wants defence spending to rise to 3% of national income by 2030. That's not something the new chancellor has committed to as part of his plans to make efficiencies (read: cuts), in government.
One of the most eye-catching appointments was the return of Suella Braverman as home secretary. 
She resigned just days ago from the role after a security breach, when she sent a government document to someone not authorised to receive it.
She endorsed Mr Sunak to be the new leader two days ago, a move seen as a massive boost for his campaign as it represented support from the right-wing of the party. 
Some sources in government speculate that endorsement may well have been an ask for something in return. There was a hint of that in her article for the Daily Telegraph backing Mr Sunak - where she said we will ""only stop boats crossing the Channel"" if the UK passes new laws to limit the impact of Modern Slavery laws, the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights. 
Such a move would be controversial, and face legal and political challenges - especially in the House of Lords. But is her appointment a signal Mr Sunak has agreed it is the way forward? It looks likely. 
Former No 10 pollster James Johnson tweeted that the tougher approach on immigration provides an opening for the Tories among swing voters in so-called Red Wall seats.
""Suella Braverman's reappointment is the most eye-catching,"" says Sir Craig. 
""There's a lot he is going to be doing that the right of the party will be uncomfortable with - for example around the budget and economy. 
""So this [signal of a harder line on immigration] means he can point to something that really goes down well with the more traditional wings of MPs and party members."" 
But her appointment may make it harder to make the argument, as Mr Sunak did earlier, that this would be a government of ""integrity"" - given her recent breach.
Mr Sunak has also brought back some key supporters to senior roles - like Dominic Raab, Steve Barclay and Oliver Dowden. They were key figures in his campaign throughout the summer, rewarded for their loyalty with roles back in government. 
Mr Dowden's return was welcomed by former cabinet minister Sir David Lidington, who said: ""No-one in the current government has a sharper understanding of the machinery of government, and how to turn slogans and paper projects into practical outcomes.""
Simon Hart has also been brought in as chief whip, responsible for party discipline and MPs' welfare. This role will be key, after months of internal infighting, to anticipate any potential rebellions or conflicts and keep Tory MPs toeing the party line. 
He's got cabinet experience as the former Welsh secretary, but also experience trying to bring different factions of the party together - something he did during the Brexit years - and is close friends with former chief whip Gavin Williamson and leader of the influential 1922 backbench committee of MPs Sir Graham Brady. 
Nadhim Zahawi, briefly chancellor over the summer, has received a slight demotion from Cabinet Office minister, to chair of the party - perhaps in response to his flip-flopping support over the last few months. 
He'll still have a tough job ahead of local elections next year - and will partly be responsible for showing the party can turn its electoral fortunes around after a series of record-low opinion polls. 
While Mr Sunak has reached out to some senior figures who backed his rivals Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, others have been shown the door. 
Boris Johnson ally Jake Berry, the former party chairman, is out, as is the former Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke - a significant backer of Liz Truss and her plans. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg, as widely expected, is no longer business secretary. Only days ago, he'd said the party was 'Boris or Bust' - and he has openly criticised Mr Sunak. Sunak allies will not miss him. 
wo have been replaced by loyalist Grant Shapps as business secretary and the return of Michael Gove as levelling up secretary, which he held under Boris Johnson. 
wo were key in orchestrating MPs to rebel against Ms Truss's plans to cut the top rate of tax for the highest earners, a thorn in her side at the Tory party conference causing her to U-turn. 
resulting Cabinet is somewhat of a Tory party coalition - with senior figures from the left, right and centre of the party. 
(mammoth) aim is to unite the party, after years of clashes over personalities and policies, from Brexit and Boris Johnson, to tax cuts, immigration and fracking. 
will be when the new prime minister tries new policies, and makes the ever-euphemised ""difficult decisions"" on the economy that could involve some spending cuts or tax rises.
It remains to be seen if having a broad church of figures at the top will be enough to stave off dissent on the backbenches."	/news/uk-politics-63394099

Joff Whitten, from the charity, said young people will be able to suggest their ""own visions"" for how the money from a social action fund will be spent.
He said it was hoped a ""legacy project"" for the island would be created.

Mr Whitten said this would ensure the charity was not speaking for young people but ""speaking with them"" about issues they were facing.
He said this was essential if we wanted ""to continue to meet their needs in a relevant way"".
funding also ""highlights the importance external funders see in our work"" he added.
grant for the project, which is set to last 18 months, is from the youth social action fund run by BBC Children in Need.
Its aim is to enable young people to make a difference to communities and develop their own skills and knowledge.
Mr Whitten said this could be ""volunteering, fundraising, campaigning or supporting peers"" and there were ""lots of ways to take practical action to make a positive difference"".

business	Hundreds of jobs at risk at Billingham's Mitsubishi chemical plant	"More than 200 jobs are at risk after a chemical company announced plans to end production on Teesside.
Mitsubishi Chemical UK said it had begun a consultation with workers at its plant in Billingham.
It added ""rapidly escalating"" gas prices, a downturn in the European economy caused by inflation and weaker demand meant UK manufacturing was no longer viable.
A final decision is expected to be made in January.
firm said production of methacrylates, which are used in acrylic products and require large quantities of gas, initially stopped in January as part of a planned overhaul and had remained halted since September because of worsening economic factors.
In a statement, it said it had explored options included a temporary mothballing of the site but had concluded it was not viable.
Malcolm Kidd, vice-president of the firm's methacrylates business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, described it as a ""very sad day for everyone associated with our business on Teesside"".
""Our employees and various partners have worked tirelessly and creatively to support the business in delivering high-quality products safely and sustainably over decades but our position now and looking ahead appears simply unsustainable.
""Every effort will now go into supporting our skilled and talented production technicians, and engineering, technical and business support staff during this difficult period.""
Alex Cunningham, the Labour MP for Stockton North, said the announcement was a ""blow to both the local area and the 238 people and their families who will be directly affected"". 
He called for the government to announce a long-term strategy to combat high energy prices and told BBC Radio Tees: ""The company has been working hard to try to preserve these jobs but I really fear they may be going. The energy costs in this country are crippling industry. 
""What's going to happen further down the line - are other organisations her going to be similarly affected and stop production? We've already seen CF Fertilisers stop making ammonia and instead import it from America.

""We deeply apologise for the immense burden and deep concern the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station of Tepco Holdings is causing local residents and society at large,"" a statement said.
Plaintiffs emerged from the Tokyo court holding banners reading ""shareholders win"" and ""responsibility recognised"".
r lawyers said they believed it to be the largest amount of compensation ever awarded in a civil lawsuit in Japan.
knowledged 13 trillion yen was ""well beyond"" the former bosses capacity to pay, but that the plaintiffs expect the men to pay as much as their assets allow.
""One accident with a nuclear power plant leads to irreversible damage to both human lives and the environment,"" said Yui Kimura, one of the plaintiffs.
""The executives of companies that operate such plants also have a huge responsibility on them that is incomparable with other companies.""
""I think the court's judgement says that anyone who does not have the determination or capability to take on that responsibility should not become an executive.""
Fukushima nuclear disaster happened on 11 March 2011 when a massive earthquake off north-east Japan triggered a tsunami which led to a nuclear meltdown.
It was the worst nuclear power incident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, but has been considered less damaging to local people because far lower quantities of radioactive iodine were released.
No one was killed in the disaster, but the long-term effects of the radiation remain a matter of debate.

entertainment	David Tennant jealous of incoming Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa	"Former Doctor Who star David Tennant says he's ""a little bit jealous"" of the incoming Doctor Ncuti Gatwa ""starting on this exciting journey.""
""Ncuti is brilliant,"" adds Tennant, who played the Doctor between 2005-2010. ""He's a lovely, lovely man and he's full of beans and he's really talented. I mean he's like scary-talented.
""So I'm thrilled for every Doctor Who fan for what's to come and I include myself in that number.""
In May the BBC announced that Tennant himself would be reprising the role as part of the show's 60th anniversary celebrations next year. Details are shrouded in secrecy but we know that he will be reunited with Catherine Tate, who played his companion Donna Noble.
And Tennant now tells the BBC how the reunion came about. ""It all slightly happened a little bit by accident,"" he reveals. And, strange as it may sound, Covid played a huge role. 
He, Tate and Russell T Davies, who was in charge of the hit sci-fi series between 2005 and 2009, got involved in Doctor Who: Lockdown! a worldwide series of online ""watch-alongs"" of previous episodes designed to pass the time during the pandemic, ""when everyone was locked in their house"".
""That's where this all started"", explains Tennant. 
""At a certain time and day everyone would press play on a certain episode and some of the people who had been involved in those episodes were tweeting along.
""I don't tweet but my wife helped me,"" he laughs.
rogramme, which is almost 60 years old, was being filmed in central Bristol
Afterwards the three of them ""were just having a text exchange and Catherine said, 'wouldn't it be fun to do it again?'""
He adds: ""Russell said, 'We could do a one off, maybe they'd let us'.""
""We said, 'yeah that would be a laugh,' and then it all went quiet.""
But last year Davies announced he was back as Doctor Who's showrunner. And Tennant and Tate received a surprising offer.
""Suddenly Russell let us know that he was taking over the show again and he would be back fully in charge and would we come and play a little bit for him?"" says Tennant.
""So I don't know if we gave him the idea to take Doctor Who back but certainly we thought if he's doing it, we can't let these young people have all the fun.""
Before we see him back on screen in Doctor Who though, Tennant is returning to the stage, for the first time in five years.
Next month he will star in CP Taylor's play Good, about a decent, respectable German professor, with a Jewish best friend, who becomes a high-ranking Nazi.
""When you look back at the historical events like what happened in Germany in the 1930s, yes there were some monsters but mostly it was a nation full of people that were as complex and different and broadly decent as most of us are,"" says Tennant. ""So what happened?"" 
was first performed in 1981, and in a revival at the Royal Exchange in Manchester in 2011, the Guardian's Lyn Gardner highlighted ""the fatal lack of dramatic tension in a play in which quite a nice man slips under with no struggle at all"".
But Tennant says Good will ask the audience hard questions because ""it sort of plonks you in the middle of this awful context and it makes you wonder how you would cope yourself"".
""One likes to think one is the true, virtuous crusading type of person. One fears one is the one that lets things slide past. [For instance] we are staring down the barrel of a terrible climate emergency, what am I really doing about that?""
And staging the work, the award-winning director Dominic Cooke says he has been struck by how timeless the themes of the play are. 
""What this play does is it allows you to identify with this very sort of decent, funny, charming person and watch him make compromises,"" he says. ""We all want to think that we are going to be the person that will stand up and say no when something terrible happens. 
""But the truth is that very few of us actually do.""

rate of 6.07%, the financial information service Moneyfacts says, a level not seen since the financial crisis in November 2008. 
Mortgage rates have been going up for months, but recorded a sharp increase in response to the fall-out from the mini-budget nearly two weeks ago.
First-time buyers and those looking to remortgage are affected.
An average of at least 100,000 people a month are coming to the end of their current mortgage, and face a significant rise in their monthly repayments.
""Borrowers may well be concerned about the rise to fixed mortgage rates but it is essential they seek advice to assess the deals that are available to them right now,"" said Rachel Springall from Moneyfacts.
""Fixing for longer may seem more appealing, particularly as both the average two- and five-year fixed rates rise to levels not seen in over a decade. Consumers must carefully consider whether now is the right time to buy a home or to wait and see how things change in the coming weeks.""
Brokers say lenders are ""playing safe"" with rates amid current economic uncertainty, but costs could eventually start to dip.
Uncertainty over future interest rates after the mini-budget led lenders to pull more than a thousand deals from the market.

Bosses from Barclays, Natwest and Lloyds Banking Group are expected to attend.
rest rate on a new, average two-year fixed deal on the morning of the speech was 4.74%, compared with 6.07% now. That is a difference of about Â£170 a month on repayments for somebody borrowing Â£200,000 on a 30-year mortgage.
A five-year fixed deal has typically risen from 4.75% to 5.97% over the same period.

entertainment	Wagatha play won't punch down at Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney, writer says	"""The Wagatha Christie case has mystery, suspense and broken friendships - all the ingredients for a great drama,"" says Liv Hennessy, whose West End play is based on the High Court clash.
Love it or hate it, the dispute between Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney captured many headlines earlier this year.
It arguably offered light relief to audiences weary of hearing about war in Ukraine, Covid, the heatwave and politics.
""Wagatha felt like a real water-cooler moment in the UK, which I think is quite rare now,"" says playwright Hennessy, a former story producer for ITV soap opera Emmerdale.
rial was dubbed ""Wagatha Christie"" - a reference to both women as footballers' wives and girlfriends (Wags), and Agatha Christie, the author famous for her whodunit mysteries.
Following her 2019 Instagram sting operation, Mrs Rooney dramatically accused Mrs Vardy, on social media, of leaking private stories about her to the Sun.
Mrs Vardy has always denied this, and filed legal proceedings against Mrs Rooney - but in July, Mrs Justice Steyn ruled Mrs Rooney's accusation was ""substantially true"". 
Mrs Rooney is expected to receive an estimated Â£1.5m from Mrs Vardy towards legal costs.
Hennessy says her play, Vardy v Rooney: The Wagatha Christie Trial, captures a moment in time - exploring what is private and what public.
""This case couldn't have happened 10 years ago, and it probably won't happen in 10 years, because media law is catching up with how we operate on social media every day,"" she says.
""The play questions what we ask of our public figures, and whether we believe they should behave with integrity - which is fair enough if you're a politician, somebody very high up. 
""But it becomes murkier when you're a social-media influencer, or you're 'fame adjacent', but you have social media.
""When you start to monetise public trust, and get money for your Instagram posts, we sort of have a right to know whether we can trust you or not.""
Before putting pen to paper, Hennessy spent a fortnight wading through 1,200 pages of transcripts, bought by the play's producers. 
wasn't a hardship though - she had already been ""glued to the case"", following it via WhatsApp groups and Twitter and taking particular delight at some of the memes.
""I come from soap, so I'm used to very, very tight deadlines, working under extreme pressure and finding the story,"" Hennessy says.
""It suited my skill set - but it's been a ride.""
She also consulted people with the necessary legal knowledge, ""to make sure I nailed it"".
f verbatim theatre - when its characters speak, they use real-life words.  
Director Lisa Spirling, who approached Hennessy to write the play, knew the format could work.
""Nicholas Kent did a huge amount of plays based on trials [and inquiries] at London's Tricycle Theatre, so we knew it had been done before"", she says.
His work includes plays on the Grenfell Tower fire, Stephen Lawrence's murder and Bloody Sunday.
Both women are clear about what struck them about the Vardy-Rooney trial - and what they chose to avoid.
Hennessy stresses she is not trying to belittle the women, arguably best-known for being footballers' wives.
""You could think we're punching down at people who don't understand the legal system, we're going to laugh at them,"" she says. 
""That's not what this play is about.""
Instead, what really came across reading the transcripts was ""they both are incredibly intelligent women, who navigate a legal system - most of us would be very confused"", Hennessy says.
""They're so self-possessed, they're confident, they handle it,"" she says.
Spirling admits being initially ""quite snobby"" about the case, until the play's producer, London Theatre Society president Eleanor Lloyd, persuaded her to think again and explore the issues raised. 
She agreed, and realised it had huge potential as a play. And she is not alone in this - Channel 4 is also making a docudrama about the case.
""I was asking, 'Are we pulling down two working-class women, or two women in a situation who happen to be very rich?"" Spirling says, on how the women could be portrayed. 
But her ""hackles went up"" at the ""patriarchy of everyone calling them Wags the whole time"".
Former sports journalist Alison Kervin, who landed a three-book deal in the 2000s to write novels starring Wags, told the Times recently: ""I hate the term Wag.
""The whole 'Wag' culture infantilised women,"" she said. ""They were seen as the pretty hangers-on.
""Girls no longer want to be just wives or girlfriends. As we've seen this summer, women are able to play football too - and actually win.""
Spirling also found a connection with the case.
""I'm from Lancashire originally, and many of my (male) friends are professional footballers,"" she says. ""A bizarre amount were from my local school.
""To see those boys go on that journey and have too much money, be too famous too young, and what that does to you - to be living that life, as those guys have for 20 years -the exhaustion of that, and how you maintain it, and for the women alongside it. 
""So I just I felt like I knew that world.""
And after a ""deep dive into what people were fighting for"" in the court case, she concluded ""it's reputation and control of their narrative... Instagram is a way of individuals taking back control"".
One voice missing from the trial was that of Caroline Watt, Mrs Vardy's friend and agent.
A consultant forensic psychiatrist produced a report concluding she was unfit to give oral evidence.
But she is featured in the play.
""What Liv has done extraordinarily well is to find a way to bring Caroline into the room,"" Spirling says. 
""So you have a sense of her, partly because of so many WhatsApp messages, but also in the presence of that person. 
""She's the one we're not talking about, where you go, 'That is someone that's lost their job, who wasn't in the public eye, who clearly this has been incredibly distressing for, and significant and troubling... it feels really important."" 
Hennessey also includes football pundits on stage, who comment on the action in court, plus action replays. 
She won't divulge which memorable moments from the court case are featured but says: ""I don't think people will be disappointed.""
roduction started out as a one-night-only performance but has been extended after demand for tickets.
""We want to give people a great night out,"" Spirling says. ""The world is pretty tough right now. 
""This play absolutely has conversations about economics and fame and celebrity - and it will give people a bit of escapism.""

entertainment	David Amess: Charity Christmas single release for murdered MP	"A charity choir is to release a Christmas single in tribute to their late president, Sir David Amess.
Music Man Project has teamed up with the Royal Marines Band to create the Christmas single, Music Is Magic.
Sir David, the former MP for Southend West, was fatally stabbed during a constituency surgery in October 2021. 
music education charity, which works with people with learning disabilities, sang at his funeral mass in Westminster Cathedral.
David Stanley, who founded the Music Man Project in 2000 in Southend, said the charity single was a fitting tribute to Sir David, who had been involved with the project for more than 20 years, becoming its president.
Proceeds from the single will go to supporting learning disabled people across the UK.
""He was our biggest champion,"" Mr Stanley said.
""Those with learning disabilities will often have a physical disability as well and they've got lots of challenges.
""They're the last to really achieve equality in that respect. 
""So I'm doing this through music by putting them out there. And David believed in that. And he really believed in them.""
In 2019, Sir David helped the Music Man Project organise an event in which 200 children with learning disabilities played at the Royal Albert Hall in front of a crowd of 3,000 people.
""(Sir David) said, 'We've conquered the Royal Albert Hall. Next stop is Broadway',"" Mr Stanley remembered.
""That's the ultimate dream.
""So when it came to a tribute, to me this was the best thing ever, because music is magic. It's about bringing people together.
""Our link with the Royal Marines was all about - can the universal language of music connect those elite musicians with my musicians with learning disabilities? And my gosh, the answer is yes.""
Christmas single marks the beginning of a long-term partnership between the charity and the Royal Marines Band.
""We couldn't be prouder of this unique collaboration with The Music Man Project,"" Lt Col Jason Burcham, of the Royal Marines Band Service, said.
""Each performer radiates warmth, energy, and positivity.
""They are also incredibly talented musicians. Rehearsing and recording this single was a wonderful experience.""
Music Is Magic will be released on 16 December.

technology	Elon Musk suspends Kanye West from Twitter for inciting violence	"Kanye West has been suspended from Twitter and accused of ""inciting violence"" over offensive tweets - just two months after his last ban.
US rapper, who now goes by the name Ye, posted a series of erratic tweets - one of which appeared to show a symbol combining a swastika and a Jewish star.
witter's new boss Elon Musk was asked by one user to ""fix Kanye"".
West had ""violated our rule against incitement to violence"", Musk tweeted.
""Account will be suspended,"" Musk wrote in a Twitter post.
Also on Thursday, during an interview with US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and with his face covered in a mask, West praised Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and ranted about sin, pornography and the devil.
f the UK's Holocaust Educational Trust described West's comments as ""repulsive and sickening"". 
""These comments mixed with his high profile and huge following have dangerous consequences,"" chief executive Karen Pollock said.
In recent months West has caused controversy with a series of antisemitic and racist remarks - leading to clothing giant Adidas cutting ties with the rapper.
West was initially locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts after posting antisemitic messages in October. Both platforms removed West's posts - which accused rapper Diddy of being controlled by Jewish people - saying the star had violated policies on hate speech.
me in response to a backlash against his show at Paris Fashion Week, where he wore a T-shirt carrying the slogan ""White Lives Matter"".
Anti-Defamation League in the US branded his phrase ""hate speech"" and attributed it to white supremacists, who began using it in 2015 in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.
Earlier this year, West was suspended from Instagram for 24 hours in March after using a racial slur in reference to comedian Trevor Noah.
In 2018, singer Will.i.am led a backlash against West after he claimed the enslavement of African-Americans over centuries may have been a ""choice"" - remarks he later tried to clarify.
His latest Twitter ban comes hours after the right-wing social media platform Parler - which styles itself as a ""free speech"" alternative to mainstream platforms - said West could no longer buy the firm.
In a statement, Parlement Technologies said: ""The company has mutually agreed with Ye to terminate the intent of sale."" 
firm - which runs the much smaller platform, popular with conservatives and the far right - said the decision was made in mid-November.
""Parler will continue to pursue future opportunities for growth and the evolution of the platform for our vibrant community,"" the firm said in its statement.
Musk took control over Twitter in October and immediately embarked on a series of radical changes within the social media giant - including lifting the bans on controversial accounts.
He has clarified that he had no role in bringing West back on Twitter, saying the account was restored before he acquired the social media platform.
West was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago and has publicly spoken about his challenges with his mental health.
However, medical experts and people who share West's condition have warned that mental health problems do not go hand-in-hand with antisemitism."	/news/business-63826675
politics	Jeremy Hunt: Cut energy use to stop Putin 'blackmail'	"Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said people should cut their energy use to stop the UK being ""blackmailed"" by people like Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Mr Hunt said ""in the end everyone is going to have to take responsibility for their energy bills"" and consider how to cut their consumption. 
government has extended support with energy bills until April 2024, but at a less generous level than now. 
It has set out a ""national ambition"" to cut energy use by 15% by 2030. 
Appearing in front of the Commons Treasury Committee, the chancellor said households could save themselves around Â£500 in the years to come if they hit that target and people ""need to change their behaviour"". 
In his Autumn Statement last week, Mr Hunt said the government would continue to help households with energy bills but from April the support would be less generous. 
It means the annual bill for a typical household will rise to Â£3,000 in April, up from the current figure of Â£2,500. 
Without government support a typical household would have paid Â£4,279 from January, regulator Ofgem said.
most vulnerable households will also get additional cost-of-living payments. 
Mr Hunt told MPs on the Treasury Committee: ""We will always be there to help poorer households, the way we do that will change.
""But for most people we need you to play your part in reducing our energy dependency.""
He added: ""We are saying to people that in the end everyone is going to have to take responsibility for their energy bills and they're going to have to think about how they're going to reduce their energy consumption.
""Because it is a national mission to make sure that we can't be blackmailed by people like Putin when they do things that interrupt international energy supplies.""
Mr Hunt said the household energy bill support scheme would cost Â£80bn this year and ""possibly around half that next year"". 
In the long run he warned ""we're going to need everyone to help us crack this problem if we're not going to have a huge additional burden on taxpayers"".
""That isn't just at a national level but that's for every household,"" he said. 
""We think that the Â£500 that we're offering to help people save next year, at current gas prices, if people do the 15%, they could save that Â£500 themselves in the amount they pay in the years that follow. 
""So we're trying to help people to help themselves. We're giving them a cushion this year and next. But we do need people to change their behaviour.""
But shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said it was ""shameful that this government is waiting three years to start a proper home insulation programme"". 
He said Labour's plan for a publicly owned renewable energy company would ""bring down bills once and for all"" and ""take back control of our energy"". 
war in Ukraine has reduced supplies of Russian gas as Western countries seek to phase out Russian imports and Moscow cuts the amount of gas it supplies to Europe. 
Although the UK is far less reliant on Russian gas than mainland Europe, it could still suffer knock-on effects from shortfalls in overall supply.
Energy regulator Ofgem has warned of ""a significant risk"" of gas shortages this winter due to the war in Ukraine."	/news/uk-politics-63738388

Engineers spent Christmas Day 2021 installing the 500-tonne structure at Newport railway station but it has yet to open to the public because the council can't get the parts. 
It will link Devon Place and Queensway and replace an often vandalised subway.
uncil want it open by the year's end but say it might not happen until 2023.
It said it was experiencing ""supply chain issues"" with materials needed to finish the area at the bottom of the Queensway side of the bridge.
uthority said it was working with the contractor to get an opening date for the Welsh government funded crossing.
""We are looking at whether it is feasible for us to get enough of the public realm completed to allow us to open the bridge before the end of the year as we had hoped,"" a spokesman said.
""This would involve us facilitating access to the bridge from the Queensway side, while maintaining a construction compound area adjacent to this access point for the rest of the work to be completed.
""If this is not possible, then the bridge will open in early 2023.""
Plans to put the construction work for the bridge out to tender were reported in 2019 after the Welsh government pledged Â£4m to the project in 2014. 
Â£10.5m budget was presented to the Welsh government in January 2021, Newport Council said, and had not changed since.

technology	Drones to track Walsall's off-road bikers	"A council is considering buying drones to deal with nuisance off-road bikers following hundreds of complaints.
In the past 12 months West Midlands Police has received 777 reports from residents in Walsall.
Walsall Council says the technology could help police gather evidence to track offenders and seize their motorbikes.
""These are deadly machines in the wrong hands,"" said Paul Gordon, the council's director of resilient communities.
Mr Gordon added the problem with off-road bikes spanned the borough but there were ""corridors of activity where we would want to take targeted action"", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
""We're gathering lots of data and we're starting to get the evidence together to be able to deal with this in a proactive way. The message from ourselves is 'we're coming to get you and your bikes',"" he said.
Ch Supt Phil Dolby, of Walsall police, said the West Midlands force did have use of drone technology but this was shared across the area, with demand high.
""Off-road bikes and the way they are being ridden at the moment is totally unacceptable, frustrating and very dangerous,""said Ch Supt Dolby. ""What's quite tricky for us is a tactical responseÂ that doesn't lead to injuries to the public, these people or my officers either being injured or in court.""
Police were ""coming around to"" the use of drone footage to track offenders, confiscate and crush vehicles, he added.
Walsall Council figures reveal a further 57 complaints of anti-social biking to its community protection team in the past 12 months.
Councillor Garry Perry, deputy leader for resilient communities, said he had also received more than 100 reports, largely of noise nuisance and intimidation, from residents in the Pelsall area.
""You have those who just have [bikes] for recreational use but you have another type who use those vehicles on the road without helmets and often with their faces covered,"" he said.
Walsall Council leader Mike Bird said his cabinet would look into financing a drone for the police to use solely in the borough.
""We've got to stop this. It is an invest to save,"" Mr Bird added.

sports	Winter Olympics: Cas rejects US skaters' request for silver medals before end of Games	"The Court of Arbitration for Sport has rejected an appeal by the United States' figure skaters who wanted to receive their silver medals during the Winter Olympics.
Russian Olympic Committee won the event but the medals have not been awarded because Kamila Valieva, 15, failed a drugs test.
Cas said it would release the reason for its decision in the coming days.
Beijing Games officially close on Sunday.
US team - consisting of Evan Bates, Karen Chen, Nathan Chen, Madison Chock, Zachary Donohue, Brandon Frazier, Madison Hubbell, Alexa Knierim and Vincent Zhou - finished second in the event on 7 February.
However, no medal ceremony has been held, with the athletes instead receiving teddy bears of the mascot Bing Dwen Dwen in a low-key event at the skating venue.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said a medal ceremony cannot be held until Valieva's case has been fully investigated.
US skaters, who wanted to go home with their medals, met IOC president Thomas Bach this week to discuss the issue.
IOC said it would not comment on an ongoing procedure.
It was announced on 8 February that Valieva had tested positive in December for angina drug trimetazidine.
She successfully appealed against a Russian Anti-Doping Agency decision to impose a provisional suspension.
Cas ruled that ""exceptional circumstances"" meant she should not be suspended. That allowed Valieva to compete in the women's single event, where she finished fourth."	/sport/winter-olympics/60446019
politics	Rishi Sunak hires ITV's Amber de Botton as communications chief	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has chosen ITV News journalist Amber de Botton as his new director of communications. 
She will leave the broadcaster, where she is head of UK news, to run Downing Street's media operation. 
Downing Street confirmed the hire after ITV's political editor Robert Peston revealed his colleague would be joining the prime minister's team. 
It comes as removal vans were spotted in Downing Street on Saturday as Mr Sunak and his family moved into No 10.
rime minister, along with his wife and two daughters, previously lived in the flat above No 10 when he was chancellor under Boris Johnson.
Ms De Botton was previously head of politics at ITV and deputy head of politics at Sky News, after starting her career as a parliamentary reporter.
She will be a special advisor, responsible for selling the merits of the government.
Mr Peston tweeted that she is ""a brilliant news editor and journalist"" and ""leaves a huge hole at ITV News"".
rector of communications for No 10 is a crucial role at the heart of government. 
Part of an inner circle of close advisers, Amber de Botton will have direct access to the prime minister and speak on his authority.
job will involve honing the government's message, briefing journalists and limiting the damage in a crisis.
f a senior editor from broadcast news, highly praised by former colleagues, tells us the Sunak administration is serious about communication.
Perhaps that is no surprise. Slick campaign videos and personalised social media posts show Mr Sunak is an image-conscious politician not shy of building his brand.
But tax rises and spending cuts looming in the November budget could be a hard sell to voters, and communication will be key.
w prime minister has previously poached journalists from ITV. 
In 2020, the then-chancellor appointed the broadcaster's national editor Allegra Stratton as his director of strategic communications, before she was picked by Mr Johnson to lead No 10's daily televised press briefings. 
Ms Stratton later resigned after ITV published a video laughing at how to describe a Downing Street staff party held during a period of pandemic restrictions.
Salaries for the role can vary. Ex-BBC correspondent Guto Harri, Downing Street director of communications under Boris Johnson in 2022, received Â£140,000 to Â£144,999 annually for the role.
While Adam Jones, Liz Truss's director of communications, was on a Â£80,000 to Â£84,999 salary during her short time in office as prime minister, figures showed."	/news/uk-63440024
technology	Ex-Google ad boss builds tracker-free search engine	"An advert- and tracker-free search engine launches in the UK, France and Germany on Thursday.
Neeva has 600,000 users in the US, where it launched last year.
Creator Sridhar Ramaswamy, who worked at Google for 16 years and ran its ad business, told BBC News the technology sector had become ""exploitative"" of people's data, something he no longer wanted to be a part of.
rackers share information about online activity, largely to target adverts.
Neeva has raised $77.5m (Â£68m) from investors. 
It offers free-to-use search, with other features such as password-manager access and virtual-private-network (VPN) service to be made available on a subscription basis. 
Users are asked to create an account, to build subscriptions at a later date.
And the UK price was likely to be about Â£5 per month, Mr Ramaswamy said.
""We felt the traditional search engines had become about advertising and advertisers - and not really about serving users,"" he said.
""Google has a dominant position in the marketplace - and the incentive for them to truly innovate, to truly create disruptive experiences, is not really there. 
""And then also as a company they feel obligated to show more and more revenue and profit to their shareholders, so they just keep increasing the number of ads.""
Search the word ""migraine"" on both Google and Neeva, and the first page of the results are fairly similar - links to news articles and factual information.
But with a brand, the difference becomes more stark. 
When I try ""BMW"", both search engines lead with links to the carmaker's website and Wikipedia entry.
But while Google follows with a map, social-media feeds and links to used-car dealers, Neeva sticks with different BMW official pages. 
Google certainly has more variety - but it is also blatantly pushing me towards buying a car.
Neeva's Chrome browser extension lists the trackers installed on web pages visited.
I tried a few:
And almost all - but not the BBC - had at least one belonging to Google, meaning Google is receiving anonymised information about users visiting those pages. 
While I had the extension activated, no ads displayed around the editorial content.
But ultimately, none of Neeva's other rivals has dented the dominance of Google search. 
""To Bing"" or ""to Duckduckgo"" - another privacy-focused service - are not verbs in the way ""to google"" is. 
And asked if Mr Ramaswamy could ever topple his former employer, Steph Liu, an analyst at Forrester specialising in privacy and search, said: ""Realistically, no.
""It's a sort of David and Goliath story. Google has too many users, it has too much revenue.
""The ultimate goal is to offer an alternative for the consumer base who are worried about their privacy, who don't want Google hoovering up their data and targeting ads based on their search history""."	/news/technology-63130364
sports	Rugby World Cup: What next for England and the women's game?	"England captain Sarah Hunter said the latest Rugby World Cup made her feel like ""finally people are just waking up to how great our sport is"".
Rugby Football Union chief executive Bill Sweeney agreed, saying the nail-biting final was ""probably more entertaining than the men's game"".
urnament in New Zealand was the best-attended women's World Cup ever, breaking the attendance record for a women's matchday twice - the opening-day attendance of 34,235 surpassed by the 42,579 sell-out Eden Park crowd for the final.
A turning point for women's rugby, but there is more to come.
Here, BBC Sport explores some of the main questions concerning the future of the game and England's team after their fifth World Cup final loss to New Zealand.
None of the Red Roses have announced their retirement since the final, but 37-year-old Hunter has already confirmed she will stop playing before a home World Cup in 2025.
Abbie Ward - a key player in England's formidable line-out - says she will ""100%"" continue until the next World Cup, while star centre Emily Scarratt, who is 32, is undecided.
She said losing a second successive final to New Zealand was ""certainly a driving force to win a World Cup"".
Scarratt said: ""I said to my mum when I saw her and gave her a big hug: 'Brace yourself, we might have to do another three years of this.'
""It's definitely not a decision to be made now. We'll see.""
Head coach Simon Middleton has also lost two World Cup finals in a row, and he is yet to confirm whether he wants to stay at the helm.
Middleton, whose reign has included a record 30-Test winning streak and four successive Six Nations titles, has a contract until the end of the 2023 Women's Six Nations.
Sweeney told BBC Radio 5 Live it was ""important to have some continuity"" after the World Cup, adding it ""would be good to have a woman"" leading England ""at some point"".
He said there was ""a raft of coaches"" on the RFU's radar to succeed Middleton and confirmed he would discuss the head coach's future when he is back in England.
RFU has led the way in investing in women's rugby since giving the Red Roses full-time contracts in 2019.
Other sides, including Wales and New Zealand, are now following suit in making their women's teams professional.
Black Ferns were only given contracts earlier this year, and Sweeney said it was ""a bit disappointing"" they won the World Cup despite a comparative lack of investment.
With the game still growing, both the Red Roses and the World Cup in New Zealand were run at a loss.
But Sweeney said England's final loss ""won't change the views on investment"", adding 70% of the fans at Eden Park on Saturday were new followers for New Zealand Rugby and women's rugby ""is good for the overall health of the game"".
World Rugby chief executive Alan Gilpin said the success of the tournament in New Zealand had ""given us confidence to invest more"".
In two weeks, England's players can return to play for their clubs in the Premier 15s - the most competitive women's domestic league in the world, which is also benefiting from increased RFU investment.
r next international outing will be in the 2023 Women's Six Nations, which starts on 26 March 2023.
In that tournament, England will tour the country as they play in Newcastle and Northampton before a first standalone fixture at Twickenham against France in what is likely to be the decider.
About 20,000 tickets have been sold for the Twickenham game, and Sweeney is confident that number will reach 40,000 - half the stadium's capacity.
RFU is also hopeful it can host World Rugby's new women's competition WXV in 2024, in preparation for a home World Cup in 2025.
Sweeney is aiming for the 2025 World Cup to break even and says ""we will fill Twickenham"" for the final ""and hopefully for the semi-final as well"".
Before that, the plan is to host matches in different regions around the country in what Sweeney says will be ""the best ever women's World Cup""."	/sport/rugby-union/63619340
entertainment	Thomas Gainsborough: Sudbury centre opens after Â£10m rebuild	"A painter's studio and a portrait of the first black man to vote in Britain are included in a Â£10m redevelopment of a museum dedicated to world-renowned artist Thomas Gainsborough.
His Grade I listed childhood home in Sudbury, Suffolk, has been transformed and now includes an extension. 
Museum director Mark Bills said the changes made it ""a cultural hub in the heart of East Anglia"".
Gainsborough's House reopens to visitors today. 
Mr Bills said the redevelopment, which included four new galleries, had ""fundamentally changed this historic site"".
Born in 1727, Gainsborough was considered one of the leading painters of the 18th Century. He moved to Ipswich in 1752, and then Bath in 1759, establishing himself as portrait painter, while also producing landscapes.
He was a founding member of the Royal Academy in London and preferred painting landscapes, yet he found fame for his portraits of the Royal Family and other aristocratic or successful 18th Century people. 
museum transformation includes the creation of a Gainsborough Gallery, lined with Sudbury silk and bringing together 20 of his portraits and landscapes, some on loan from private and public collections. 
An 18th Century painting room and print studio has been recreated, complete with printing press, easel, anatomical plaster casts and north-facing windows, which are particularly important when painting from life.
Other highlights include The Constable Room, where visitors can see the landscapes of John Constable (1776-1837) in the vicinity of ""Constable Country"" - the area downstream on the River Stour from Sudbury that inspired the artist.
museum also now has a temporary displays gallery, where a copy of Gainsborough's portrait of Ignatius Sancho (about 1729 -1780) has been hung.
Sancho was born on a slave ship heading for the Spanish West Indies and would later become the first black man in Britain to vote and the first to receive a press obituary. 
redevelopment was supported by Â£5m of National Lottery Heritage Fund money. 
Its chief executive Eilish McGuinness said she was ""delighted"" the museum was now able to ""tell the full story of one of our most important British artists"".

""I think it upset the male singer-songwriters. They'd go, 'Oh no. Do we have to bare our souls like this now?'""
She added: ""I think it made people nervous.""
r said she was pleased that contemporary artists seemed better equipped to express the feelings of loss and sorrow that she explored on landmark albums like Ladies of the Canyon (1970) and Blue (1971).
""It took to this generation, they seem to be able to face those emotions more easily than my generation,"" she told Sir Elton in an interview for his Rocket Hour radio show on Apple Music.
It is one of the singer's first full-length interviews since recovering from a brain aneurysm in 2015, which temporarily left her unable to walk and talk.
r became friends during Mitchell's rehabilitation, when she hosted ""Joni Jams"" with fellow musicians in her California living room.
""Music has helped you so much,"" said Sir Elton, as he described her ""incredible"" recovery.
Mitchell is considered one of the finest singer-songwriters of her era, once described by a critic as the ""Yang to Bob Dylan's Yin, equalling him in richness and profusion of imagery"".
Her gift is for writing deeply personal, folk-inspired, song-poems that explored the darker sides of life and love. Tracks like Both Sides Now, A Case Of You and River are considered standards.
But after her aneurysm, she had to relearn how to sing and play guitar, watching old videos of herself ""to see where I put my fingers"".
""It's amazing what an aneurysm knocks out,"" she previously told CBS News. ""You don't know how to get out of a chair, you don't know how to get out of a bed. You have to learn all these things by rote again.""
In recent years, the singer has attended concerts celebrating her music, and was given the prestigious Kennedy Center Honor last December.
US President Joe Biden paid tribute to the star at the ceremony, saying: ""Her gift touches the range of human nature and the sense of struggle and how we overcome and how we love.""
Mitchell made her return to the stage this summer with an unannounced performance at the Newport Folk Festival - where she first performed in 1969.
w was arranged by country star Brandi Carlile, who has worked diligently to remind the world of Mitchell's legacy, performing tribute concerts and writing liner notes for the singer's archive box sets, as well as becoming a steadfast friend.
During the show, Mitchell performed tracks like Circle Game, Both Sides Now and Big Yellow Taxi, surrounded by friends on a set that recreated the look of her California living room.
Speaking to Sir Elton, the star said the entire concert was performed without a rehearsal. ""Didn't have any,"" she laughed. ""We just winged it.""
ger also addressed how her voice had changed over the years as a result of smoking and ill-health - noting that she opted to play guitar on Just Like This Train during her Newport concert instead of trying recreate the original's soaring vocals.
""I couldn't sing the key,"" she explained. ""I've become an alto. I'm not a soprano any more, so I couldn't sing the song. 
""I thought people might feel lighted [betrayed] if I just played the guitar part, but I like the guitar part to that song. So anyway, it was very well received, much to my delight.""
Sir Elton hinted that the Newport Folk Festival performance was being lined up for an official release.
""Yeah, we're trying to put that out,"" Mitchell confirmed.
She has since announced another live appearance - her first headline concert for 23 years - in Washington state next June.
Sir Elton also had a suggestion for getting Joni back into the studio. ""I want you to make an album in this room. Like Johnny Cash did with Hurt,"" he said.
""Every corner of this room is Joni. I've been to a lot of places in my life, but this room is one of the most special rooms I've ever been to in my whole life.""
Accepting the compliment with grace, Mitchell declined to speculate on whether she would return to recording music.
""We did some background vocals up in the balcony once,"" she said. ""That's the only time we've recorded in this room.""
full interview can be heard on Sir Elton's radio show on Apple Music from 17:00 GMT on Saturday, 12 November.

technology	Drone operators warned about flying near airports	"Police and airport authorities are warning of the ""potentially catastrophic"" consequences of drones being flown near airports.
It follows recent reported sightings of drones in the vicinity of the Glasgow Airport flightpath.
Drone operators are being reminded that it is a criminal offence to fly them near airports without permission.
warnings have been issued by Police Scotland, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and airport operators.
Every airport and airfield is protected by a flight restriction zone and drone operators cannot fly there without permission of the airfield operator and air traffic control.
Insp David Ferguson, of Police Scotland's aviation security and safety unit, said: ""There has been a significant growth in the use of drones and Police Scotland works in partnership with the CAA and airport operators to ensure compliant use.
""What may seem like a harmless pastime or hobby could have potentially catastrophic consequences if the drone is flown in a location which poses a threat to aircraft.
""We also actively engage with drone pilots to encourage responsible use of the aircraft and ensure they do not interfere with the operations at airports as well as more rural airfields.""
Jonathan Nicholson from the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: ""Drones can be great fun but people must fly them safely and follow the rules. Breaking the CAA's Dronecode and failing to fly responsibly could result in criminal prosecution, including imprisonment.
""Anyone operating a drone must do so responsibly and observe all relevant rules and regulations. The rules for flying drones are designed to keep everybody safe.""
A spokesperson for Glasgow Airport added: ""Operating a drone or unmanned aircraft within the airport's flight restriction zone is a criminal offence and those convicted of doing so could face up to five years in prison and an unlimited fine.
""The flight restriction zone extends to a 2.5 nautical mile circle radius from the runway with extensions out with protecting the flightpath for arrival and departures.
""Endangering the crew and passengers of an aircraft is extremely dangerous and could lead to a catastrophic loss of life.
""Members of the public who witness or are aware of anyone operating a drone near our airfield should contact Police Scotland immediately."""	/news/uk-scotland-63471599
sports	Six Nations 2022: What is the tournament's greatest match of all time?	"The Six Nations has delivered some of the most memorable matches in rugby history, but which was the greatest of them all?
Former British and Irish Lions captain Sam Warburton and ex-England scrum-half Danny Care debate and discuss that question on the latest episode of Six Nations Greatest.
x matches they came up with are ranked in reverse order below. Take a trip down memory lane, then rank them yourself at the bottom of this page.
What happened: Scotland led 24-14 with seven minutes to go in Cardiff, but a yellow card for replacement hooker Scott Lawson gave Wales hope. 
Leigh Halfpenny scored under the posts in the 77th minute and, after Scotland's Phil Godman was sin-binned, Stephen Jones took three points to level things at 24-24 with 15 seconds remaining. 
With the clock in red, Shane Williams found his way over to seal victory as the Cardiff crowd exploded with joy.
Warburton: It was my first Six Nations campaign and I just remember Wales being completely outplayed. We were chasing the game. 
I remember running back to the halfway line with Johnathan Thomas and I remember the noise was so loud celebrating and we were looking at each other talking, from about a metre away, I could see his mouth moving but could hear nothing. It was just a wall of noise. 
You hardly ever win in that dramatic fashion. At international level you get one of those every four or five years.
What happened: England travelled to Cardiff chasing a Grand Slam in the Championship decider. Wales, beaten at home by Ireland in round one, needed a winning margin of at least seven points to take the title. 
As England's discipline crumbled, Wales led by six at the break but two second-half tries from wing Alex Cuthbert helped the hosts to a record winning margin of 27 points.
Warburton: We did our anthem and it was out of this world. It was ridiculous. My single greatest moment, without a doubt. Emotionally that game drained us. 
People probably think that we had the biggest party of the year but I remember going back to the hotel, most of us sat down, had a bottle of beer and we literally just sat there for about three hours. It was just an enormous weight off our shoulders.
Care: We weren't prepared for what was to hit us in that caldron, that atmosphere we met. It was all Wales and we couldn't wrestle back any momentum. It was probably one of the harshest lessons I've learnt.
What happened: Wales went to Paris seeking a Grand Slam and, after a fast-scoring start for both sides, Josh Adams' try edged the visitors ahead. Victory seemed secure when they led by 10 points with three minutes remaining. 
France lost Paul Willemse to a red card, before two Welsh players were sin-binned and with the man advantage, Charles Ollivon made it across the try-line in the 77th minute. With the clock in red, Brice Dulin crossed to break Welsh hearts.
Warburton: That was agonising because it would have been Alun Wyn Jones' second Grand Slam as captain. It just shows how tough the Six Nations isâ¦ to win away from home and to win a Championship. Wales did everything they had to do for 79 minutes and 50 seconds but they lost in the end.
What happened: Ireland travelled to Wales seeking their first Grand Slam in 61 years. Wales led 6-0 at the break thanks to two Stephen Jones penalties, but Brian O'Driscoll's pick-and-go try and an incredible take by Tommy Bowe down the right wing put Ireland ahead. 
wo more penalties from Jones brought Wales to within two points and his 76th-minute drop-goal seemed to seal victory. But Ronan O'Gara scored a drop-goal of his own with two minutes remaining to make Irish rugby history.
Warburton: It was such a dramatic away win for Ireland that went right to the wire. For the two seconds it takes to score a drop-goal, the whole stadium holds their breath. Maybe not the most entertaining game from minute one to 80 but the significance it has for Ireland puts it in our top six.
What happened: England travelled to Dublin hoping for a first Grand Slam since 1995, having lost on the final weekend in several recent attempts. Ireland were looking to secure a first clean sweep since 1948. 
floodgates opened in the second half as Mike Tindall crossed, Will Greenwood made it over twice and Dan Luger scored. Jonny Wilkinson added 15 points from the boot - including two drop-goals - to complete a comprehensive win.
Warburton: England just did a demolition job and I remember watching it thinking that's what cut-throat, ruthless, world-class dominating teams do. Away at Ireland is one of the hardest away games you can have. To go there and deliver with such dominance sent a message to the rest of the world.
Care: It was such a unique game in that both teams were going for the Slam [on the final day]. It was all to play for.
What happened: A heavy defeat for Scotland seemed certain when England raced into a 31-point lead after half an hour. A second-half blitz by Scotland made it 31-31 and Sam Johnson looked to have sealed victory when he scored in the 76th minute. But George Ford crossed at the death to complete a remarkable draw.
Care: This for me was a crazy Six Nations game. For entertainment value, this is a 10 out of 10. Those moments when you need an ice-cool player - George Ford was the man. I don't think we'll see a game like that again.

politics	Richmond constituents react to Rishi Sunak becoming PM	"Rishi Sunak is set to become the next prime minister after winning the Conservative leadership contest.
No 10 said he will formally take over on Tuesday after meeting King Charles.
42-year-old former chancellor was the only contender to gain enough support from MPs to stand for the job.
BBC visited the market town of Richmond to find out how his constituents have reacted to their MP getting the top job.
One woman in the town's market square described his election as ""brilliant"".
""Apart from anything else he can do sums, which none of the others could,"" she added.
A man said that he ""would have preferred Boris"" but conceded that Mr Sunak would be ""as good as anyone else"".
A swift thumbs up and a ""he's got to be better than the last one"" was our first indication that people in Richmond were welcoming a new PM. 
Big boots, waterproofs and walking poles - no odd sight here right next to the Yorkshire Dales.
A market square where you could do a pretty hefty pub crawl without walking more than a few hundred years is even busier today. 
Half term means that families, walkers and tourists are mingling with the locals, perhaps diluting Conservative support a little in the strongest Blue seat in Yorkshire. 
king of William Hague to be his successor went a long way to securing Rishi Sunak a seat here in 2015. The new PM will be hoping to do more than the four years his mentor did at the helm of the Conservative Party.
Knocking about in the market square teenagers ask what the news satellite trucks are doing and question why Boris Johnson isn't going to be PM.
And if you're one of the many journalists about to book tickets to come up here look up the lash goshte - according to one takeaway it's Richmond's favourite food.
And whoever decided to put kebab and chips inside a calzone - well, they get my vote. 
Another woman who runs a special needs school said she had met the future PM last summer and was ""really, really happy at the news"". 
""He came to visit us at the school and I was just touched by how lovely he was with the children and the staff,"" she said.
One woman described his elevation as ""inevitable"". ""I think he will probably do a better job but I do think it's time for a general election,"" she said.

health	Nottinghamshire woman's warning after broken hip revealed cancer	"A woman has described how she found she had incurable blood cancer only after being rushed to hospital with an injured hip.
Helen Livingston said her diagnosis came ""out of the blue"" when she went in for treatment on a bone fracture.
Nottinghamshire grandmother had attributed early signs something might be seriously wrong to the demands of her career as a teacher.
Now she is helping raise awareness of the importance of early treatment.
Mrs Livingston, from East Leake, began to suffer tiredness and an aching hip in 2014 and when the pain became unbearable she had to go to accident and emergency.
wed the damage to her hip had been caused by myeloma - a blood cancer that is treatable but cannot be cured.
Myeloma UK charity said early blood tests can identify the disease and potentially help prevent related complications like broken bones. 
66-year-old said: ""I went to the hospital with a fractured hip and came out with cancer.
""The diagnosis was the hardest because it came out of the blue.
""I had the pain but no infections or any of the other symptoms.
""I always say I'm glad my hip broke because it could have taken a long time before it got picked up otherwise. Being told it was incurable just freaks you out."" 
Mrs Livingston had a hip replacement but was unable to return to work and had to retire early.
She received a stem cell transplant in 2014 and has been in remission since and has regular health checks.
""I know it will come back but, when it does, I know there are so many more treatments now,"" she said.
She added her treatment had allowed her to spend more time with her husband Andy, her sons and grandchildren. 
Myeloma UK said it had invested Â£19m in researching new drugs which it said had increased life expectancy for patients.

politics	Prince of Wales has no plans for investiture, Kensington Palace confirms	"Prince of Wales has no plans for an investiture, Kensington Palace has said.
William made his first visit on Wednesday to the Welsh Parliament since his father made him Prince of Wales.
King's decision triggered a debate about whether or not there should be a repeat of Charles' 1969 investiture in Caernarfon.
While there was support for that event at the time, it also faced protests.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said it ""easy to see"" why a different approach was being taken ""during tough times"".
Meanwhile the prince said he is supporting both England and Wales at the World Cup, following controversy over his support for the former.
Deputy presiding officer David Rees said William accepted a Welsh bucket hat during the visit.
William met the First Minister Mark Drakeford, Presiding Officer Elin Jones and party leaders.
He arrived at the Senedd by car and entered through a side-entrance for the meeting in Cardiff, which is free of the pomp or crowds of recent royal events in the capital.
Prince of Wales was given his title by the new King the day following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.
It was William's second official visit to the country as Prince of Wales, after he and the Princess of Wales visited Anglesey and Swansea in September.
role of Prince of Wales has faced criticism - the Plaid Cymru Senedd group said the title of has ""no formal place or responsibility within Welsh life"", following their meeting with the royal.
But the visit was welcomed by the Welsh Conservatives.
Kensington Palace said the meeting aimed to ""deepen his understand of the issues and opportunities of greatest importance to the Welsh people"".
BBC Wales was told that the prince understands he is at the start of a long period of association with Wales' political system, and was keen to express his desire to deepen the trust and respect of people of Wales over time.
He planned to tell them that there are no formal plans for an investiture ceremony, aware of the political controversy that surrounded the event in 1969.
Kensington Palace said an investiture is ""not on the table"".
ure ceremony for the then-Prince of Wales took place in Caernarfon Castle in 1969
On Wednesday the prince was given a brief tour of the Senedd building and debating chamber led by the Llywydd, Elin Jones.
He met politicians from the four parties represented in the Senedd - Welsh Labour, the Welsh Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Liberal Democrats.
William concluded his visit by meeting the Welsh Youth Parliament.
meeting follows controversy about his support for the English football team, ahead of the World Cup.
On Tuesday evening, Welsh actor Michael Sheen questioned whether William's role as Prince of Wales was appropriate given his support of the England football team.
Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru MS, said on Twitter: ""He's an Englishman, so of course he supports England,"" but added: ""I'm clear there shouldn't be a Prince of Wales. But this football thing must be embarrassing for him too. Just highlights the nonsense.""
After Elin Jones raised the World Cup group match between Wales and England, he said: ""I'm telling everyone I'm supporting both, definitely. I can't lose.
""I've supported England since I've been quite small, but I support Welsh rugby and that's my kind of way of doing it.
""I happily support Wales over England in the rugby.
""I've got to be able to play carefully with my affiliations because I worry otherwise if I suddenly drop England to support Wales then that doesn't look right for the sport either. So I can't do that.""
Prince Charles, as he was then, was 20 when he was crowned at the investiture ceremony at Caernarfon Castle.
While it had no formal constitutional role, the ceremony presented Charles with the symbols that marked him as Prince of Wales: the sword, coronet, ring, rod and mantle.
In addition to the 4000 guests present in the castle, 19 million saw it at home and another 500 million watched around the world.
was watched by a TV audience of millions. Street parties were held across the country, but it polarised opinion in Wales amid a backdrop of protests and bombings.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""I think it's a decision for him to make. He will have thought carefully about it. I always believed myself that taking 1969 as a template for Wales in 2022 would not be a reliable guide to the best way to proceed."" 
""In tough times, I think everybody who is in a position of making decisions about how public money is spent, and the sort of messages that it sends to the wider population, will be thinking hard about that and I think it's very easy to see why the prince himself, and those who advise him, will come to the conclusion that a different approach is the right one to take in 2022.""  
King Charles' decision to make William Prince of Wales triggered discussion among some politicians over whether an investiture would be suitable.
But in a Walesonline article, written in October, the presiding officer said investitures ""should be consigned"" to the 20th century.
Plaid Cymru MS Elin Jones, who is among those meeting William on Wednesday, wrote her republicanism remained ""unshaken"" following her involvement in the events marking the death of Queen Elizabeth at the Senedd and at St James' Palace, for the Accession Council.
In September Kensington Palace said there were no plans for Prince William to have an investiture ""anything like his father had"" as Prince of Wales.
Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price were among those who met William on Wednesday.
Mr Davies said it was a ""pleasure to welcome the Prince of Wales"".
He added: ""After the King and Queen's recent visit, it is fantastic to see the bonds between Wales and our Royal Family becoming stronger still. There is a huge amount of goodwill towards the Prince and Princess in Wales, and I know there will always be a warm welcome for them whenever they visit.
A spokesperson on behalf of the Plaid Cymru group said: ""The Plaid Cymru group have been clear that we believe the title of the ""Prince of Wales"" to be antiquated and out of touch with a modern, equal, and democratic Wales.""
""Furthermore, given the exacerbating cost of living crisis and the historical sensitives, an investiture should not take place in any circumstance - nor should any service that could be interpreted as a lesser form of an investiture,"" the group said.
It added: ""We look forward to seeing the Prince use the platform he has already, that isn't necessarily reliant on him being Prince of Wales, to promote good causes and positive change across Wales and the world including tackling child poverty, inequality, and the climate crisis.""
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds, said: ""It was an honour to welcome His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to the Senedd this morning and I am extremely grateful for him taking the time to have a one-on-one meeting with me.
""It is very clear that His Royal Highness cares deeply about the people of Wales and it was fantastic to hear of his commitment to mental health causes, particularly his interest in mental health provisions for rural areas and farmers."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63635177
technology	Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner share Instagram criticism	"Reality TV stars Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner have joined Instagram content creators in criticising the platform's new design.
Ms Kardashian and Ms Jenner shared posts on their Instagram Stories asking the Meta-owned platform to ""make Instagram Instagram again"".
Instagram has recently shifted its focus from individual posts to its own short video format Reels.
But some users are telling Instagram to ""stop trying to be TikTok"".
Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri admitted in a Reel on Tuesday that there has been ""a lot of change all at once"" on the platform.
While reassuring viewers photos will stay on Instagram as ""part of our heritage"", he said he believes Instagram will become more video-based over time.
Instagram will need ""to lean into that shift"" of what people like, consume, share and view on Instagram to video - while still supporting photos, he added. 
He noted that other features causing concern for creators, such as a full-screen mode, recommendations and visibility of friends' posts, will be subject to further improvement.
""We're going to stay in a place where we try and put your friends' content at the top of feeds and in front of stories whenever possible,"" he said. 
""But we're also going to need to evolve because the world is changing quickly. And we're going to have to change along with it.""
form announced new tools for creators using its Reels feature on 21 July, letting them ""Remix"" previous public photo posts as Reels and simultaneously film and react to content on front and back cameras with a ""Dual"" feature.
Instagram also revealed that new videos which are less than 15 minutes long will be automatically uploaded as Reels in coming weeks.
In 2018 shares of social media company Snap tumbled after Ms Jenner tweeted about her reluctance to use Snapchat, to her 24.5million Twitter followers. 
Her tweet followed a controversial Snapchat re-design in response to increased competition from alternative social media platforms. 
After referring to Snapchat as her ""first love"" in a follow-up tweet, Ms Jenner helped to accelerate a drastic share slide for Snap which wiped $1.3bn (Â£1bn) off the company's stock in a day.  
At the time of writing, Ms Jenner has 360million followers on Instagram and Ms Kardashian has 325million.
Both shared a post to their followers on Monday which said ""Make Instagram Instagram again"" and in brackets added ""stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends"". 
Ms Kardashian added ""pretty please"" when sharing this on her Story, while Ms Jenner seconded this by adding ""pleaseeeeeee"" on her own. 
riginal post, uploaded as a meme by 21-year-old photographer and content creator Tati Bruening, has now been shared across Instagram and made its way onto other social platforms like Twitter.
Ms Bruening says she was scrolling through Instagram last week when she noticed her friends' photos missing from her feed.
""I was getting quite frustrated, so half-jokingly made a meme about it and posted it,"" she said. 
She added that while the post just came from a place of ""momentary frustration"", it's not surprising that it ""started getting shared around the photography community and expanded from there"".
""I'm all for the app evolving and adding features like Reels,"" she said, but added there is a ""stark difference"" between what sort of content used to be visible on Instagram feeds and now. 
She says this left many who grew their platform as photographers on Instagram wondering ""how they're going to further their platform on an app that no longer favours the content that they create"".
Ms Bruening's petition, calling on Instagram to bring back chronological timelines and ""an algorithm which favours photos"" now has more than 140,000 signatures.
""We just want to see when our friends post,"" the petition states. ""The beauty of Instagram was that it was INSTAntaneous.""

technology	US midterms: How BBC's voter profiles were shown hate and disinformation online	"Disinformation and Social Media correspondent Marianna Spring set up a series of social media accounts to investigate what voters are being recommended online at a turbulent time for US politics. After over two months of running the profiles, this is what she found. 
I open up Britney's Instagram and click on an account that's been recommended in her feed. I'm greeted by a meme falsely declaring that President Joe Biden never really won the 2020 election, and several others targeting named female politicians with misogynistic comments and abusive language. 
Britney is one of five profiles I've created to track what US voters can be recommended and exposed to online ahead of the midterm elections. While social media sites say they are committed to tackling disinformation and hate on their platforms ahead of the poll, for my undercover voters, misleading and violent posts appear to have only increased in recent weeks. 
My five voters were created to represent views from across the US political spectrum, based on data gathered by the Pew Research Centre. I gave each of them a profile on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter, with names and computer-generated photos.  
re: 
For all of them, I followed additional accounts when they were suggested, as well as keeping up their original interests. 
While these profiles can't offer an exhaustive insight into what every US voter could be seeing - and they don't have friends or followers - they do give us a snapshot of what voters across the political spectrum are being exposed to. 
Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), which tracks extremism and disinformation worldwide, says that election conspiracy claims and abusive language aimed at politicians online have intensified in the run-up to the midterms.
As I've checked into each of my undercover voters' accounts over the past two months, it's Britney's that have been most frequently exposed to violent and misleading content.  
When setting up her account, I liked pages and accounts that supported Mr Trump, opposed mandatory vaccination and questioned the motives of billionaires. These topics appear to have been a gateway to more extreme content, when compared with the other undercover voters. 
Larry was exposed to posts featuring misleading claims about the 2020 election and abusive language directed at politicians, while Emma was also recommended several pages using abusive language aimed at supporters of Donald Trump and Supreme Court Justices, but nothing on the scale of what Britney was recommended. 
When I logged onto Instagram in particular, I found she was recommended more and more accounts that made false claims about fraudulent voting and denied that President Biden won the election. 
regularly featured hashtags like #Trumpwon in their profile descriptions and on their posts, and shared memes about the riots on the Capitol claiming that ""January 6th wasn't an insurrection"".
Britney's profile was also shown TikTok videos from accounts promoting conspiracy theories that the election was rigged, also repeating the phrase ""Trump Won"". 
Last week, Instagram showed her conspiracy theories contradicting the police account of what happened when Paul Pelosi, the husband of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was violently attacked in their home. Posts also made light of the violence. 
Finally, pages recommended to Britney's Instagram account also featured posts talking about female politicians in abusive and misogynistic terms. 
most frequent targets were Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. There were comments about them performing sex acts, and slurs about their appearances, alongside criticism of their politics. While posts often spoke about Joe Biden and Donald Trump in hateful terms, they were not subject to the same sexualised language.
guage was unique to Britney's accounts. On Facebook, Emma was recommended pages that promoted naming and shaming racists and Trump supporters, but the rhetoric had not escalated in the same way. 
Gabriela was increasingly recommended right-leaning content on social media, often about inflation and the cost of living crisis, but it stopped short of the more extreme disinformation and hate that Britney encountered. 
Larry and Michael were targeted more frequently by official campaign adverts and content from the political parties themselves, especially on sites like YouTube. For Larry, the messaging was focused on crime, inflation and immigration. For Michael, the adverts and posts talked about abortion, climate change and education.
As well as noting the uptick in hate ahead of the midterms, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue says disinformation online has focused on conspiracies about the Biden administration, as well as the issue of voting in specific US states. 
""That, when combined with social media product features and failed policies, is giving permission to more hate and vitriol,"" said Jiore Craig, the ISD's Head of Elections and Digital Integrity.
In particular, the ISD found election conspiracy theories in short-form video formats across several platforms. Social media companies have ""inconsistent and insufficient moderation policies"" to deal with this kind of content, its research concludes. 
research also expresses concerns that the major social media companies are not taking election denials seriously, although they have made various commitments to tackling disinformation and hate ahead of the midterms.
In August, Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - said it would devote ""hundreds of people across more than 40 teams"" to ensure the security and safety of the midterms, and apply ""learnings"" from the past election. 
Meta told the BBC that it has robust measures in place to combat misinformation, including partnerships with 10 fact-checking organisations in the US.
It also said it has ""clear policies about what is and isn't allowed on our platforms"" and ""continually reviews content"" to see if it violates policies. 
kTok also announced its own ""commitment to election integrity"" ahead of the vote, saying it had partnered with fact-checking organisations. It told the BBC it took its ""responsibility to protect the integrity of our platform and elections with utmost seriousness"".
Populist Right Britney, Progressive Left Emma and even Apolitical Gabriela have been recommended increasingly polarised content on Twitter over the past two months, particularly on immigration, crime and climate change. 
Britney's account was also shown a conspiracy theory shared by Elon Musk about the attack on Mr Pelosi - Mr Musk later deleted his tweet. 
re are concerns that lay-offs and potential changes to moderation policies on Twitter, which Mr Musk now owns, could also lead to an increase in online disinformation just before voters head to the polls.
Several of the Instagram accounts that Britney has been recommended promoting claims that Trump really won the 2020 election have also praised Mr Musk for buying Twitter and referenced their plans to return to the site. 
witter says that while it has lost employees, their ""core moderation capabilities remain in place""."	/news/world-us-canada-63530374
health	Covid: Why are some places testing Chinese arrivals?	"When a country of 1.4 billion people suddenly ended its zero-Covid policy after nearly three years, there was little doubt what would happen.   
Poor immunisation levels and little natural immunity meant an explosion of cases - just as China is about to lift restrictions on its citizens travelling abroad. 
So now, some countries - wary of an influx of cases - are imposing Covid testing, and possible quarantine, on visitors from China.
Covid wave hitting China is not due to some radical new variant, but Omicron in its different forms.   
BF.7 and BQ.1 are both sub-lineages of BA.5, which itself is part of the Omicron ""family"" - more contagious, more infectious than any previous Covid strain. 
But these Omicron sub-variants have all been widely detected outside China - including in the UK.    
Omicron has been the dominant global variant for more than a year, but that does not exclude the possibility that a new variant of concern will emerge in future. 
A key reason that many countries are imposing Covid checks on travellers from China is the lack of surveillance data coming out of the country. The more Covid that is circulating, the more chance there is for the virus to mutate. 
But new variants can pop up anywhere - the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India have all been the likely origins of previous variants of concern.
So will the new Covid test restrictions make any difference?
Several countries are asking travellers from China to produce a negative Covid test in order to gain entry. 
US said this would ""slow the spread"" of the virus, while scientists worked to identify any potential variants that may emerge. But no-one is suggesting that this will stop Covid cases coming in. 
Italy has gone further, and is imposing mandatory post-arrival PCR tests on travellers from China. Those that test positive will need to quarantine for several days. 
ge of enabling genomic sequencing of the virus, and so aids the search for new variants. But it will also add to airport congestion.   
Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that those travellers from China who have tested positive so far are carriers of ""Omicron variants already present in Italy"". Italy wants an EU-wide approach on the issue - but the EU's disease agency says, for many reasons, that is ""unjustified"".
In the UK, there is plenty of Covid about. Probably well over a million people a week are getting infected, either at work, home or socialising - in other words anywhere people gather. The latest ONS survey estimated that around 1 in 45 people had the virus earlier this month.
But most of the UK population is very well protected from severe illness, via a combination of vaccines and repeated natural infection.
means Covid - while still a potential danger here - is no longer the threat it once was.

health	Reading: Smell training workshop to help Covid sufferers	"A smell training workshop to help people who lost their sense of smell after getting Covid is being held this weekend. 
AbScent, a charity which works to increase understanding and raise awareness of the condition, is holding the session in Reading. 
It said about 58,000 people in the town suffered smell loss during the pandemic. 
Some are still experiencing problems, the charity said. 
AbScent said more than four million people in the UK have experienced smell and taste loss and that research suggests 46% also suffer from smell distortions. 
Parosmia is a distorted odour with a known source, for example onions smelling like rotten meat. Phantosmia is having a smell sensation without a source, such as random cigarette smoke.   
Smell training is one of the only treatments evidenced to improve smell. 
AbScent said smell training ""is the process of actively sniffing the same four scents every day, spending around 20 seconds on each scent with intense concentration"". 
rity said it is easy, safe, and recommended by doctors. ""Anyone can do smell training if they would like to improve their sense of smell,"" it added.  
AbScent founder Chrissi Kelly said: ""Our work with researchers and scientists around the world to better understand the function of the olfactory sense is crucial for the future. 
""But it is the work that we do with people who are suffering with little support and understanding that really encapsulates our values. We know that people struggle to get help.""

sports	Battle of the Brits: Dan Evans beats Andy Murray as England win title	"Dan Evans beat Andy Murray as England clinched the Battle of the Brits title with an 8-4 win over Scotland.
British number two Evans won 6-4 3-6 10-8 against the three-time Grand Slam champion, after England team-mates Neal Skupski and Paul Jubb had earlier defeated Jamie Murray and Jonny O'Mara 6-4 5-7 10-6 in the preceding doubles.
Evans' victory put England 5-1 ahead and just one win away from the exhibition title in Aberdeen, before Paul Jubb stepped up to beat Scotland's Aidan McHugh 6-2 6-2.
Although a dead rubber, the Murray brothers then beat Evans and Skupski 6-3 6-4 in the final match of the tournament, and what could have been the last opportunity for Scottish fans to see them play together.
""I certainly hope it's not the case but we need to treat these moments like we might not get the opportunity again because we're getting on a bit, and you never know what's around the corner,"" said Andy Murray.
""It was amazing the whole two days, I'm very proud of Jamie for the event he put on.
""It meant a lot to both us the way all of the players showed up, competed well and went after it.""
Battle of the Brits was set up by Jamie Murray with the first edition held during the Covid-19 lockdown, without spectators, at a time when the regular tennis tours had been halted.
2021 edition was cancelled because of rising coronavirus cases at the time.
r's tournament has seen four men's singles and two men's doubles matches spread over two days at Aberdeen's P&J Arena.
Wednesday's action had finished tied at 1-1 after Andy Murray defeated Jack Draper, after Evans had won the opening rubber for England against 373rd-ranked McHugh.
In Thursday's rubbers, two points were awarded for wins in the afternoon session, and three in the evening session, which started with Jubb's singles win. "	/sport/tennis/64072036
entertainment	Her Loss: Drake and 21 Savage sued by Vogue publisher	"Drake and 21 Savage are being sued by Vogue's publisher over claims they used the brand name to promote their new album, Her Loss, without permission.
CondÃ© Nast claims the rappers' promo campaign was built ""entirely"" on the unauthorised use of Vogue trademarks and false representations.
It said the musicians created a counterfeit issue of the magazine which they distributed.
In a complaint, the publisher said it's seeking at least $4m (Â£3.49m).
Larry Stein, the lawyer representing Drake and 21 Savage, has not yet responded to BBC Newsbeat's request for comment.
CondÃ© Nast claims the rappers falsely suggested having the ""love and support"" of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.
r complaint says it resulted in ""unmistakable"" confusion, with Drake and 21 Savage being wrongly touted as ""new cover stars"".
""All of this is false. And none of it has been authorised by CondÃ© Nast,"" the legal paperwork says.
It added the rappers' ""flippant disregard"" for the publisher's rights ""have left it with no choice but to commence this action"".
mas Walters, who founded advertising agency Billion Dollar Boy, said the publisher will need to defend itself because the Vogue brand is ""everything"" to the outlet.
""In an era where journalism is consistently being used for free, people aren't buying magazines anymore, that is their value,"" says Thom.
""From their perspective, 21 Savage and Drake have used that brand without compensating for that investment.""
And if they don't defend it in this instance, Thom says there's a risk ""anyone could start using the Vogue brand"".
Since its release on 4 November, Her Loss has had mixed reviews and has also caused a stir after one track, Circo Loco, appeared to suggest singer Megan Thee Stallion had lied about being shot.
Music publication NME gave the album three stars, saying it was an ""exciting prospect marred by lazy song writing"" and packed with ""cheap misogyny"".
Rolling Stone went a step further, branding the album ""a misfire"".
CondÃ© Nast is seeking at least $4m in damages - or triple Drake and 21 Savage's profits from their album and ""counterfeit"" magazine.
But could this actually work out well for Drake and 21 Savage? Thom thinks so.
""I think Drake and 21 Savage are certainly going to benefit from doing this,"" he says. ""Probably more so than the amount than the lawsuit is claiming.
""When you're a star of the calibre of Drake, you know that you're willing to take the risk. They obviously would have seen a bigger upside here than downside.""

sports	Wasps Netball situation 'unprecedented' after holding company goes into administration	"The Netball Players Association (NPA) says the situation at Super League side Wasps is ""unprecedented"" in the sport.
Wasps Holdings Limited, the holding company for Wasps men's and women's rugby teams, plus Wasps Netball, went into administration on Monday.
All members of the playing squads and staff have been made redundant and the NPA said the ""impact"" on the club is ""yet to be fully understood"".
Wasps won the Super League title in 2017, their debut season, and in 2018.
""This is unprecedented in our sport and we will learn and adapt to give the best support that we can,"" said the NPA, adding that it was ""deeply saddened"" by Monday's news.
In a statement, the organisation run and managed by current and retired netball players added: ""We will continue conversations with England Netball and the wider netball community to try and find solutions for players where we can, and provide them with the individual support they may need in the coming weeks and months.
""All NPA members at Wasps have been contacted over the last few days and we will continue to offer them support.""
Governing body England Netball said in a statement: ""We had sincerely hoped that an appropriate solution could have been found to ensure the survival of Wasps Holdings Limited, and whilst we process exactly what this news means for the future of Wasps Netball, our thoughts are with the club, its players and their wider support team during this incredibly difficult time. 
""We will continue to work together with all relevant parties including the Netball Players Association, and are committed to exploring solutions to protect netball opportunities at community, pathway and elite level."""	/sport/netball/63292115
technology	Byjus, Meta, Twitter: India tech workers fight back amid mass layoffs	"usands of young Indians are suddenly staring at an uncertain future as technology companies and start-ups announce mass layoffs due to global headwinds and funding crunches. But many are refusing to stay quiet about it.
In October, when Ravi (name changed on request) realised that he and several colleagues were likely to lose their jobs with a major Indian edtech firm, he immediately set up a  private messaging group with them.
group soon became a ""safe space"" for Ravi and his teammates to air their fears, share tips on dealing with the management and discuss labour laws and workers' rights. 
""It helped many in the team negotiate better exit policies with the company,"" Ravi says.
few months have been difficult for Indian workers in private companies - especially in the tech sector. Edtech firms Byju's and Unacademy have cut hundreds of jobs; social media giant Twitter has laid off more than half of its staff in India and Indians are among those affected after Meta - Facebook's parent company - shaved off about 13% of its 87,000-strong workforce.
f layoffs has sparked outrage on social media and many of those affected are turning to the internet -  like their counterparts in other countries - to air their dissatisfaction and form support networks. 
're tweeting about unceremonious firings, asking for jobs on LinkedIn, and using messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Slack to rally colleagues, assert their rights and share information with journalists.
rtly because the culture of shame and silence that once existed around redundancies in India is gradually wearing thin as mass layoffs become more common. 
Pritha Dutt, a management and development sector professional, says that even a couple of decades ago, terminations were most likely chalked up to ""a performance issue"".
""Today, layoffs and downsizing have become accepted business practices, so terminations are no longer a taboo topic,"" she says.
And while the jury is still out on how effective social media is as a tool for redressal, experts say that it is helping unite and amplify voices, especially as trade unions are no longer as powerful as they used to be. 
While millions of Indian workers still belong to trade unions, the movement as a whole has been weakening for years. A number of factors - including burgeoning private sector jobs, new labour reforms and a rise in contractual work - have played a role in denting their membership and might.
""Along with employers making themselves more accessible, social media too is giving employees a platform to air their grievances, thereby reducing the need for a mediator - a role traditionally played by unions,"" says Professor Chandrasekhar Sripada at the Indian School of Business.
After Byju's announced in October that it would ""rationalise"" about 2,500 employees to ""achieve profitability"", many of its employees have been speaking to the media - often anonymously - about the company culture and the pressures they face. 
Sacked Twitter employees have taken to social media to vent their frustrations. ""Always a Tweep never a Twit,"" tweeted one former employee in a veiled reference to new owner Elon Musk's Twitter bio at the time. ""Got fired without even a confirmation email. There's always a new low,"" said another.
With the job market expanding, Ms Dutt says employees have become more confident about the marketability of their skills and don't mind standing up for their rights, even if that means burning bridges by calling out a person or organisation on social media.
And this public outrage can sometimes help, like pushing employers to apologise for firing staff in an insensitive manner or for promoting a toxic work culture. 
But Ms Dutt cautions that this success could be limited and short-lived. The option may also not be available to everyone - many still fear speaking out as they worry it might jeopardise future job prospects, or invoke legal action from their employer.
's why many employees are also looking for other ways to air their grievances and fight for their rights. 
In the southern city of Thiruvananthapuram, 140 Byju's employees who alleged they were being forced to resign went on a protest and also met a Kerala state minister, who announced an investigation into the matter - the state is governed by a coalition of Left parties, which advocates for workers' rights.
Days later, Byju's said it had reversed its decision to shut down operations at Thiruvananthapuram.
ree former employees at an edtech firm told the BBC on condition of anonymity that they were working with a trade union to negotiate severance and notice periods with the company. 
Suman Dasmahapatra, president of the Bangalore chapter of the All India IT & ITeS Employees' Union - a registered trade union that has been assisting hundreds of tech employees with labour disputes since 2018 - said that the organisation's membership has been steadily growing. 
He concedes that this is still tiny compared with the total number of employees - a majority of IT sector professionals, he says, are still uncomfortable being part of trade unions, either because they fear reprisal from the management, or because ""they don't see themselves as 'workers'"".
But Mr Dasmahapatra says he is confident that India will see a resurgence in unionisation as the push and pull of global economic forces make the job market more volatile.
Over the past couple of years, US giants such as Amazon, Starbucks and Apple have seen their workers form unions and observers say calls for unionisation are likely to grow louder, and spread across industries. 
Prof Sripada, however, disagrees. He says that the proliferation and strengthening of trade unions need not become the norm, as workplaces have already become more conscious about adopting progressive, people-centric policies. 
""Unions are a product of bad people management. When employers fail, unions rise. Employers today have the benefit of hindsight so the responsibility lies with them to make people management the centre of business,"" he says.
""But if organisations continue laying off people in an insensitive and callous manner - as we're seeing happen frequently - the story might be different."""	/news/world-asia-india-63619920
business	Christmas post hit as Royal Mail workers strike	"Firms have warned of the hit to Christmas sales as postal workers squeezed by rising costs fight for higher pay and better conditions.
Royal Mail workers walked out again on Wednesday, marking the third of six strike days across the festive season.
Lucy Bryant, who sells art products, uses Royal Mail for deliveries and says it's frustrating for her and customers when they don't arrive on time.
warning comes as rail workers and driving examiners walk out too.
Postal worker walkouts coincide with the busiest time of year for Royal Mail when people and businesses are sending Christmas cards and presents.
Lucy Bryant, who runs her small business Haus of Lucy from Brighton, says she supports the strikers as ""everyone has a right to fair pay"".
However, because she relies ""so heavily on the post"" to get products from suppliers and to send her art to customers, she says it ""has made my life very hard this Christmas season"".
Some artworks are getting through, and some aren't. ""There's almost no logic to what is getting through,"" she says.
Lucy had to re-order prints that didn't arrive at a cost to the business ""that is quite a big hit for me to take,"" she says.
""I'm not Banksy - yet,"" she adds.
Watch Make Sense of Strikes on iPlayer and find out more about why people are striking and whether industrial action works.
Pip Haywood, managing director of online card company Thortful, has calculated that each day of action is costing the firm up to Â£50,000 a day.
""It's meant we've had to staff up to protect our customers,"" she told the BBC, with three times as many requests for advice on delivery windows from shoppers than usual.
""So it's not just hitting revenue, it's adding cost and also causing brand damage.""
With the company relying on Royal Mail for about 80% of its business, she says the strikes mean the firm will miss its sales target for the year.
Some parcel companies claim the walkouts are having a knock-on effect, and forcing them to delay next-day deliveries as people and firms seek alternative ways to send their post.
DPD Group said: ""We are experiencing short delays to our next-day delivery service in a small number of locations, as a result of the industrial action at the Royal Mail, which has had a huge knock-on effect across the entire industry.""   
Evri, the delivery company formerly known as Hermes, said that severe weather, Royal Mail strikes and staff shortages are causing ""some localised delays"". 
While Yodel also said that deliveries are taking longer to some areas but did not specify why.
As well as holding strikes this week, 115,000 Royal Mail workers from the Communication Workers Union (CWU) will also take industrial action on 23 December and Christmas Eve.
ute has been going on since the summer and like all the industrial action across rail, the NHS, teachers, border staff and driving examiners, pay is a key issue.
A spokesman for Royal Mail said the company had made a ""best and final pay offer worth up to 9% over 18 months"". 
""Instead of working with us to agree on changes required to fund that offer and get pay into our posties' pockets, the CWU has announced plans to ballot in the New Year for further strike action.""
But a spokesman for the CWU said that Royal Mail has offered workers a 3% pay rise this year, 3% next year as well as an additional 2% if employees agree to ""the absolute destruction"" of terms and conditions.
union has said the strikes are partly about the ""Uberisation"" of the postal service, including ""widespread changes... introducing Uber-style owner-drivers, mail centre closures and changes to Sunday working"".
Many workers are seeking wage rises as the cost of living soars. The rate at which prices are rising, known as inflation, is running at nearly 11%, which remains close to a 40-year high.
On Tuesday, a separate set of figures from the ONS revealed that the gap between wage growth in the public and private sector is near a record high.
rage pay rise for workers in the private sector was 6.9% between August and October. That compares to wage growth of just 2.7% for public sector employees.
uesday's walkout by rail staff left services running at about a fifth of capacity, on a day when snow, ice and fog hampered road and air travel. 
Around half of rail lines are shut again on Wednesday, with no services at all in most of Scotland and Wales. 
first-ever nationwide strike by nurses is also expected to go ahead this week.
And on Friday, rail workers, buses, baggage handlers, highway workers and driving examiners will walk out.
government's emergency Cobra committee will hold its second meeting of the week later to discuss how to minimise the impact of the wave of industrial action.
Along with the rail industrial action on Tuesday and Wednesday, there will also be train strikes on Friday and Saturday.
rt of a long-running dispute between unions, rail firms, the government and Network Rail over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions.
But the rail industry was hit by a drop-off in passenger numbers during the Covid pandemic, and it's under pressure to save money. Bosses say reforms need to be agreed, to afford pay increases and modernise the railway.
Network Rail wants to cut 1,900 jobs as part of changes to the way its maintenance teams work - although it insists most of this could be achieved by people leaving voluntarily.
RMT disagrees with some of the changes and wants a guarantee of no compulsory job losses."	/news/business-63961595

Rwanda, who were hosting the event, were thrown out of the tournament on Sunday for fielding four ineligible players. 
Bagirishya is ""suspected to have used forged documents in exercising his functions"", Thierry Murangira, a spokesperson for the Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB), told BBC Great Lakes.
""Investigations continue to establish the role of other federation members,"" he added.
Bagirishya, a local sports journalist who is better known as Jado Castar, has not commented on the allegations against him.
He can now be held in custody for up to five days as he is investigated before the case is handed to state prosecutors, who will decide to file charges or release him.
An investigation was launched after Nigeria and Morocco both lodged complaints over Rwanda's use of four Brazilian players as the hosts beat both teams in the group stage of the championship.
On Sunday, it was ruled that Rwanda, who had been due to play in the semi-finals, had used the Brazilians without the proper clearance.

sports	International Day of People with Disabilities: David Smith on boccia and society	"Boccia has given me great opportunities - but I don't want to be just known as the guy who throws balls for a living. There is more to me than that.
Boccia is a Paralympic sport which combines skill, precision and tactical nous. Britain's David Smith is one of its leading exponents.
winner of five Paralympic medals, including three golds , he is the current European, world and Paralympic BC1 individual champion.
For 3 December - the International Day of People with Disabilities - and before the World Championships which begin in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 5 December, Smith tells BBC Sport about the importance of boccia and why social contact is key for everyone.
I started playing the sport when I was six, but I was useless and didn't enjoy it. At that point, sport wasn't really an option for me as I was considered too physically disabled for a lot of things.
I have cerebral palsy spastic quadriplegia. While cerebral palsy itself is common, the form I have is more severe than most and affects my whole body. I'm unable to walk and since I was three years old I have used an electric wheelchair to get around. 
Once I'm in my chair I'm pretty independent, but I also have a live-in carer who does my day-to-day care so that means I can get on with life as well as I can.
But it was going to secondary school at Treloar's in Hampshire, which was a cross between Hogwarts and St Trinians for disabled children, which opened lots of avenues for me.
m of boccia is to get your balls closer to the white target ball, the jack, than your opponent can. 
It was just one of the sports I played at school and being surrounded by people who were better than me encouraged me to get my head down and work harder, and as I got better it got more interesting because the competition got tougher. 
When I was in year nine I went to the British Championships and won it, beating most of the British team who were preparing for the Athens Paralympics later that year. But it was only when I won the World Championships in 2007 that I realised I was a good player and I needed to take it more seriously.
Beijing Paralympics came around the following year and I won team gold. It has gone on from there.
Boccia gives me and my team-mates an opportunity to compete in sport at a high level, which is very important because with the level of our impairments, it would be almost impossible for us to find another sport that would allow us to compete at a Paralympics
re is powerchair football, but that isn't in the Paralympic programme yet, and although I could maybe classify to compete as a swimmer, I swim like a brick so that isn't going to happen!
In Britain today, we know that everyone - whether disabled or non-disabled - is facing a variety of challenges. 
re is no denying that costs are going up for everyone and it makes things more difficult for people to spend money on hobbies. Then there are additional challenges for disabled people around things like travel, accommodation, medical equipment and social care.
UK is among the best in the world in terms of how disabled people are supported in society, but there is still a long way to go in how disabled people are enabled to fulfil their potential and, while there are physical barriers, mindset and attitude are also important.
With everything going on in the world and so much doom and gloom and negativity, I don't think people are being encouraged to get out of their house to try new stuff or do any kind of social activity.
We should be encouraging everyone, regardless of disability, to get out and meet new people, explore what they are good at and become active members of society. 
Maybe it is time to not just think about what government and society can do for you but also what can you do for society?
I've started a community boccia club in Swansea, where I live, and that is focused around people coming in, throwing some balls, having a chat and a laugh with others - just basic social interaction. 
If you don't feel like you are able to do something and aren't encouraged, that can be quite damaging.
I'm very stubborn, so if someone tells me I can't do something I will probably do it. I love proving a point and being underestimated because it means I can slip under the radar and catch people by surprise.
But while I know that not everyone has that same determination, I don't think we are always willing to have a difficult conversation with ourselves, to look in the mirror and say 'Do I know what I want to achieve and am I doing everything I can to achieve it?'
While social issues are a factor for the next generation of boccia players coming through, there really has never been a better time to start in the sport. We just need more people to come through the door and start playing.
Now there is greater recognition for the sport, better funding thanks to UK Sport and live television coverage for some of our events - things that wouldn't have happened 20 years ago.
When I went to my first European Championships in Porto in 2005, I was a self-funded athlete and had to raise the Â£2,500 needed for me and my sports assistant, who helps me on court, to go and compete. 
Sport has given me a lot - not just the medals and honours, but the platform to move away from home, to go to university in Swansea and get a degree in aerospace engineering, chances to travel the world as an electric wheelchair user and latterly to build my own career as a nutrition coach. 
future of boccia will be whatever people make of it. It is everyone's responsibility and if I retire with the sport in a better place, then I know I have done something right. 
But it's not just medals - it is inspiring the next generation. 
At the moment, there isn't another domestic rival for me in my BC1 category and I don't know where the next challenger is coming from. So, leaving the sport in a better place would mean that there are other Britons queuing up to challenge me.
Overall, I think I've done alright in my life, but there is more to come. I'm ready to defend my world title in Rio and then focus on Paris 2024. I want to compete in Los Angeles in 2028 and also Brisbane in 2032. 
I'm not satisfied and I won't be until it's done. It's not done yet, so for me I need to keep pushing forward and keep finding new things to be good at.

business	First-time buyers hit by drop in mortgage deals	"First-time house buyers could find it more difficult to get onto the property ladder due to fewer mortgage deals with smaller deposits being on offer.
Figures from research body Moneyfacts show there were 137 mortgage offers at 95% loan-to-value on Monday, compared to 347 at the start of 2022.
wnward trend of such deals was accelerated after the mini-budget sparked turmoil on the markets.
Mortgage interest rates hit 14-year highs, but have since begun to fall.
Eleanor Williams , a finance expert at research body Moneyfacts, said first-time buyers were likely to feel the impact of the current climate ""keenly"" due to them often having smaller deposits and therefore  favouring 95% loan-to-value mortgages.
On Monday, Moneyfacts said there were 137 95% loan-to-value mortgage products, compared to 283 on the day of the government's mini-budget.
""The mortgage sector is changeable at the moment, with the level of product choice fluctuating as lenders review their offerings and try to keep up with a changing economic outlook, which has meant that there are fewer products to choose from than there were prior to the recent fiscal announcement,"" Ms Williams added.
She said that with the cost of living biting into household budgets, buyers looking for a low-deposit mortgage deal would also have concerns about meeting affordability requirements.
Mortgage rates in general have been rising for months as central banks across the world try to tackle rising inflation, which is currently at 10.1% in the UK.
But when the financial markets reacted badly to government's mini-budget last month, which promised billions of pounds of unfunded tax cuts, UK rates rose even higher.
Lenders also suspended hundreds of mortgage products amid uncertainty over how to price these long term loans.
Moneyfacts said the number of all types of mortgage deals available in the UK had recovered slightly to 3,067 - down from 3,961 on the morning of then Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's statement.
On Monday, the largest number of deals from lenders was for 75% loan-to-value mortgages (583), the research said.
ure could change again, with the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates again in November in an attempt to bring down the current rate of inflation.
Average two-and five-year fixed rates are currently at 6.55% and 6.43% respectively, levels not seen since the financial crisis of 2008. 
At least 100,000 mortgage holders a month are coming to the end of fixed-rate deals, and face steep rises in monthly repayments.

rikes by the Ballon d'Or winner lift Madrid top of La Liga, a point clear of Barcelona.
Benzema, who missed the World Cup through injury, put Real ahead with an 83rd-minute penalty after a highly disputed handball decision.
He wrapped up the win six minutes later with a calm finish from Eduardo Camavinga's pass.
was Real's first game since the World Cup, with losing French finalists Aurelien Tchouameni and Camavinga on the bench.
Luka Modric started however after leading Croatia to third place as was Benzema, the 35-year-old leading the line after missing out on Qatar having suffered a thigh injury the day before the start of the tournament.
Both teams had several chances to open the scoring, but superb goalkeeping from Valladolid's Jordi Masip and Real's Thibaut Courtois kept the game goalless until the final few minutes.
Real were awarded a penalty when Javi Sanchez was judged to have handled the ball. The decision sent the home team into a frenzy and striker Sergio Leon was sent off for dissent.
Benzema shrugged off the distraction and delay, and converted the penalty with ease.

business	Keir Starmer: Recall Parliament and abandon budget	"Sir Keir Starmer said Labour is ""showing it is ready to govern""
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for Parliament to be recalled so MPs can abandon last week's mini-budget ""before any more damage is done"".
ue of the pound dropped to $1.05 on Wednesday, after the Bank of England announced it would buy government debt to stabilise the economy. 
Downing Street has rejected calls for Parliament to be recalled. 
Sir Keir said the ""government has clearly lost control of the economy"" and had to do a U-turn immediately.
""Unlike other situations where it may be a world event, an unexpected event that causes this sort of crisis this is self-inflicted. This was made in Downing Street last Friday.
""And for what? For uncosted tax breaks for those earning hundreds of thousands of pounds.""
reasury has rejected calls to reverse any of last week's budget.  
Parliament is currently suspended while the two main parties hold their annual conferences. It is due to come back on 11 October.
Labour are calling for the mini-budget to be completely scrapped, despite supporting some measures, including keeping the basic rate of income tax to 19% from 20%.
According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) Labour's plans would reverse less than half of the Â£45bn in tax cuts announced last week,
In an interview with BBC Political Editor Chris Mason, Sir Keir would not rule out cutting public services to reduce borrowing.
Sir Keir said: ""I'm not predicting what we will put in our manifesto.""
""We've got very clear rules which are that we will pay for day to day spending and we will borrow to invest. 
""We will inherit, a complete mess from this government and obviously we'll get to those rules just as quickly as we can, as any incoming government would do.
""That's the normal situation when a government comes in.""
All the main opposition parties - including Labour, Liberal Democrats, Green Party and Plaid Cymru - have now called for Parliament to be recalled early. 
Conservative Party conference is due to begin on Sunday, with Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng giving a speech on Monday.
Watch: Key moments from Sir Keir Starmer's speech to the Labour Party conference in Liverpool
Last week, Mr Kwarteng unveiled the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years, including scrapping the top rate of income tax and lifting the cap on bankers' bonuses. 
reasury said the plans would be funded by Â£72bn of borrowing and there is an expectation this will surge as interest rates rise. 
und slumped following his statement and later fell to a record low against the dollar after Mr Kwarteng hinted there were more tax cuts to come. 
Conservative MP Simon Hoare who supported Liz Truss's defeated Tory leadership rival Rishi Sunak - described Mr Kwarteng's handling of the economy as ""inept madness"". 
Mr Hoare, the chair of the Northern Ireland select committee, tweeted: ""These are not circumstances beyond the control of Govt/Treasury. They were authored there. 
""This inept madness cannot go on.""
On Wednesday the Bank of England announced it would buy government bonds on a temporary basis to help ""restore orderly market conditions"".
Bank also signalled it is prepared to ramp up interest rates in response to the falling value of the pound, leading mortgage lenders to pull deals.
But the International Monetary (IMF) fund has criticised the UK's plans for tax cuts, warning the measures were likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis. 
IMF works to stabilise the global economy and one of its key roles is to act as an early economic warning system.
But the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Nadim Zahawi defended the government's economic plan, claiming interests rates would come down once inflation is under control.
He promised that the ""fiscal discipline that the markets are looking for will be delivered in November"".
Mr Zahawi said that co-ordination between the Bank of England and the Treasury was ""incredibly strong.""
reasury said Mr Kwarteng was due to publish his medium-term plan for the economy on 23 November, which would include ensuring that UK debt falls as a share of economic output in the medium term."	/news/uk-politics-63058869

West's tour, which is made up of gigs in Gloucester, Devizes and Bristol from 3-5 November, is one of the largest.
Mr Threlfall said the shows will be ""a lot of fun"" and will give artists the chance to engage with new audiences.
BBC Introducing shows get all their music directly from hopeful artists who send it in via the Uploader, where it is then directed to their local team based on their postcode.
g can then be selected to play and forwarded onto national radio stations for potential airplay.
""The amazing thing about BBC Introducing is that you can be an emerging artist that has produced the track, maybe even in your bedroom, and you can upload it to the BBC and potentially get radio play from there,"" said Mr Threlfall.
""You don't need a big studio production or anything around you. You really can just kind of own it as an artist,"" he added.
Singer George Ezra, who was then studying music in Bristol, uploaded his music in 2012 and was swiftly picked up by presenters Sam Bonham and Richard Pitt, who invited him to perform backstage at Glastonbury.

technology	NHS IT supplier held to ransom by hackers	"A cyber-attack on a major IT provider of the NHS has been confirmed as a ransomware attack.
Advanced, which provides digital services like patient check-in and NHS 111, says it may take three to four weeks to fully recover.
Ransomware hackers take control of IT systems, steal data and demand a payment from victims to recover.
NHS insists that disruption is minimal, but Advanced would not say whether NHS data had been stolen.
Birmingham-based firm says it first spotted the hack at 07:00 BST on 4 August and immediately took steps to contain the hackers. It is now working to restore services.
mpany refused to say if it was in negotiations with hackers or paying a ransom to them. 
In a statement, it said: ""We are rebuilding and restoring impacted systems in a separate and secure environment.""
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
An NHS England spokesperson said: ""While Advanced has confirmed that the incident impacting their software is ransomware, the NHS has tried and tested contingency plans in place including robust defences to protect our own networks, as we work with the National Cyber Security Centre to fully understand the impact. 
""The public should continue to use NHS services as normal, including NHS 111 for those who are unwell, although some people will face longer waits than usual.
""As ever, if it is an emergency, please call 999.""
An NHS psychiatrist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC the attack left his team ""making clinical decisions nearly blind"".
""If a new patient came to us, we weren't able to read their history or know very much about them,"" he said.
""The [local] trust are doing their best at setting up an alternative system, they've got a way that we can look at some historical notes now, and have set up another system to mean that we can input new notes.
""But there's still basically a week's worth of notes that we can't access. We've been told to be ready for it to not be up and running for who knows how long.""
At the end of last week, family doctors in London were warned by NHS England they could see an increased number of patients sent to them by NHS 111 because of the ""significant technical issue"", industry magazine Pulse reported.
Advanced initially said that only a ""small number of servers"" had been affected and that it might be able to recover in a week.
Products which have been affected include Adastra, which is used by NHS 111 service, and Caresys and Carenotes, which provide the backbone for care home services like patient notes and visitor booking. 
National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, says it is working with Advanced to help it recover.
A spokesman said: ""Ransomware is the key cyber-threat facing the UK, and all organisations should take immediate steps to limit risk by following our advice on how to put in place robust defences to protect their networks.""
Ransomware hackers are usually financially motivated and part of large, professionally run criminal gangs that target companies and demand hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, of pounds in ransom in the form of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
While it is hard to trace where the gangs are based, analysis suggests that 74% of all money made through ransomware attacks in 2021 went to Russia-linked hackers."	/news/technology-62506039
technology	Shinzo Abe killing: Hideo Kojima threatens to sue over false posts	"A legendary video game developer has threatened to sue over hoax posts portraying him as Shinzo Abe's killer.
Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima was linked to the shooting of Japan's former prime minister in pictures on website 4chan.
mages were shared by a French politician and reportedly broadcast by Greek and Iranian news outlets.
Kojima Productions said it ""strongly condemns the spread of fake news and rumours that convey false information"".
4chan post used a photo of Kojima and falsely labelled him as a ""left-wing extremist"" with a criminal record. 
It also included a picture of him wearing a type of Ushanka, or fur hat, worn by soldiers in communist Russia, and another of him standing next to a picture of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara.
Screenshots on social media showed Damien Rieu, a French politician associated with the country's nationalist movement, had tweeted out images of Kojima with text translated to: ""The far-left kills"".
He has since deleted his tweet and issued an apology to Kojima, saying he ""naively took a joke for information"" and ""was wrong not to check before sharing"".
In response, the game director's company tweeted a statement warning it would consider legal action over the spread of false information.
Mr Abe died last Friday after he was shot with a homemade gun.
Police say the suspect, named as Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, has admitted the killing.
By Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC Disinformation journalist
In the immediate aftermath of a tragedy, details are often murky and emotions run high.
In the absence of reliable information, misleading claims fill the gap, and Mr Abe's assassination wasn't an exception.
False claims that the assassination was staged, that Mr Abe wasn't bleeding in pictures, that the man arrested was not the real suspect, and that he was Korean or Chinese, were posted on Japanese social media.
But in other parts of the world, the focus was on Mr Kojima and a play on a racist trope about Asians.
Arguably the biggest hub of internet subculture, 4chan has been responsible for many false claims and memes. 
't the first time Mr Kojima has been the target of online misinformation. Posts falsely accusing him of ""aborting and mummifying a baby"" went viral just a few weeks ago in the context of abortion debate in the US.
As always, the best practice is to wait for reliable information from relevant authorities and trusted news sources, and avoid sharing unverified claims, no matter how viral they may be.
Japan's longest-serving prime minister, who served for a year in 2006 and then again from 2012 to 2020, before stepping down due to health reasons.
Abe later revealed that he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis, an intestinal disease.
While he was in office, he pushed more assertive policies on defence and foreign policy and wanted to amend Japan's pacifist post-war constitution.
On Japanese social media, the hashtag ""We want democracy, not violence"" was trending throughout Friday, with many users expressing their horror and disgust over Mr Abe's killing.

sports	Scottish Curling to review selection policy after Team Mouat call for change	"Scottish Curling is to revise its selection policy for major events after Olympic silver medallists Team Mouat were not selected for next month's men's World Championship.
Bruce Mouat's rink urged ""robust and transparent change"" after their successful appeal was overturned.
Ross Paterson's rink, who won the Scottish Championship, had their place confirmed after a counter appeal.
m Mouat took silver at the Worlds last year in Canada.
But Team Mouat were not present at the Scottish Championships last month as it clashed with their return from the Winter Olympics in Beijing.
Bruce Crawford, Scottish Curling chief executive, said a ""fair and balanced"" selection process was carried out by the seven-person panel - three of whom have votes - but accepted improvements could be made.
urrent selection criteria includes results and performance at the 2022 Scottish Championships, international tournaments, previous performance at major events and readiness to make the play-offs.
""We acknowledge there can be improvements to ensure there is greater clarity for future policies,"" Crawford told BBC Scotland.
""So we will engage with athletes, coaches and members to ensure that the next selection policy is better than the current one.
""We'll be making representations to the World Curling Federation to see whether the World Championships that follow the Olympics can be slightly later in the year. That would help alleviate some of this pressure.
""We'll identify whether it is a better priority for the teams that go to the Winter Olympics to have that as their focus for that season, and for other teams to be given the opportunity to prove themselves on the world stage in a year when it is not an Olympic qualification year.""
On Team Mouat's criticism, Crawford added: ""I'm quite happy that they can make that statement. I'm not entirely in agreement with all of the things they've stated, but I think that many of those things will be cleared up in our review.
""We are blessed with three very good teams who are all roughly top 30 in the world rankings, with two in the top 10. So we're in a really strong position as a sport on the men's side.
""And we've got Olympic gold medallists on the women's side, and a different team on the women's side that is going to the World Championships."""	/sport/winter-sports/60766925

""You can't say I've never beaten him on TV any more - I'm happy with that one. 
""I'm here to win, I'm not here to make up the numbers.""

Needing 16, he missed a dart at double eight and two at double four.
Rock checked out with 70 for victory said: ""I was under a lot of pressure. I dealt with it well and I'm happy.""

business	Cost of living: Lessons from history about how we spend	"In 1967, in a field near the village of Cridling Stubbs in North Yorkshire, a pot containing more than 3,300 Roman coins was unearthed.
rd of copper coins from the 300s AD were still in the jar, buried upright, with a makeshift lid on top.
""We do not know for certain why they were buried there, and why nobody ever came back to find them,"" says Kat Baxter, Leeds Museums and Galleries' curator of archaeology and numismatics.
""That is the beauty of them - we do not know the answers. It is very mysterious.""
We may not have the answers, but there are theories. The coins not only help us think about what wealthy people were doing with their cash nearly 2,000 years ago but may also frame some of the debate about the cost of living and cash today.
Cridling Stubbs hoard may have been buried for religious reasons, as some kind of offering to the gods. 
Another possibility, is that it was hidden somewhere thought to be safe in a time before banks and building societies, particularly if the owners felt their money might be taken during a time of conflict.
""These were the security worries of the time. We have the same worries today but they just take a different form,"" Ms Baxter says.
Fraudsters steal Â£4m a day from people in the UK, so protection against such cons is high on the agenda for the finance industry and its customers.
Cridling Stubbs hoard is among more than 400 objects on display at the Money Talks exhibition, which runs at Leeds City Museum until 26 June.
As well as money security, the exhibits explore subjects including how money has been used in toys and play, the evolution of banking, and different examples of currency used around the world.
""Everyone has a relationship with money in some way,"" Ms Baxter says.
Our relationship with money is being tested at present, not only through the rising cost of living, but also in the changing way we pay for things.
Since 2015, according to the consumer group Which?, some 4,685 bank branches have shut their doors.
A further 226 are already scheduled to close by the end of the year, it says, while the rate of closures in rural areas has outstripped those in urban areas.
People are increasingly using their smartphones and computers to manage their finances. Cards are now a much more common method of transaction than notes and coins.
However, Which? has warned that a move to a cashless society would leave millions of people ""cut adrift"". The government declared in the most recent Queen's Speech that it would legislate to ensure people had access to cash withdrawal and deposit facilities within a reasonable distance of home.
xhibition in Leeds confirms there are plenty of examples through history of changing ways of paying for things.
ke, for example, the kind of items used as currency. In one display case sits a finely polished and ground axe head. It was probably never used to chop anything, but would have been used in some kind of transaction - a bit like bartering.
Ms Baxter points out that there would be a wider cultural impact if notes and coins were to disappear entirely.
One part of the exhibition examines how cash is used as a lucky charm in many ways - from popping it into the shoe of a new bride, to embedding it into necklaces.
""Going cashless does not just mean losing physical coins, it means losing a number of traditions too,"" she says.
Less of a charm and more of a convenience is the way payment is often embedded into the things we wear and carry nowadays.
Using a smartphone or a watch, many of us will routinely tap to pay for items, or a bus or train fare, 
Perhaps we are happy to lose some of the traditions and physicality of cash?
A recent survey by the card issuing platform, Marqeta, found that 77% of respondents aged 18 to 24 were confident enough in contactless payments to leave their wallet at home and go out with just their phone.
""While the pandemic was the catalyst for the shift to contactless and mobile wallets, it is the convenience, security, and speed of these payment options that have made them sticky,"" says Anna Porra, Marqeta's European strategy director.
Although she says these so-called intelligent mobile wallets are still in their infancy.
Diners are already paying at a restaurant by scanning a QR code on their phone at the table and settling the bill, without ever having to call over a waiter. Soon, she says, we will be standing at a bus stop and scanning QR codes for something we might be able to buy nearby.
most significant developments will come, she suggests, when our devices not only act as a payment mechanism but also use artificial intelligence to prompt us with ways to manage our finances.
merging of payments and financial services could even give information to businesses of our worthiness to buy something on credit, and guide consumers on the way to pay and whether it is affordable.
So-called super apps in the US and China already branch out into identifying what financial products might be available to consumers, as well as providing other services such as food, hotels and taxi options.
Ms Porra says widespread adoption of intelligent wallets will only come if providers also offer widespread education, to ensure users can be confident and have control over what is being suggested.

sports	World Cup 2022: Giant Wales bucket hat unveiled in Doha	"A Welsh delegation will visit Qatar in the new year as the Welsh FA wants to ""help make the world a better place"", according to its chief executive.  
Noel Mooney said the team ""will not just pack up our tent"" at the end of the World Cup but play a continuing role in tackling issues in the country. 
His comments were made in Doha at the unveiling of a giant Welsh bucket hat.
First Minister Mark Drakeford and Welsh sport ambassadors Jess Fishlock and Colin Jackson were also at the event. 
More than 2,500 Wales fans are expected to be at Monday's opening match against the USA, marking Wales' return to the tournament after a 64 year absence. 
untry has been criticised for human rights concerns, including for its treatment of LGBTQ+ people and migrant workers.
At Sunday's unveiling, Mr Mooney said Qatar wanted to be ""a leader in the region for all these issues"" and legislative progress has occurred in the last few months on legacy funding, help for the families of workers who died, and a migrant centre. 
He said Wales would play its part through UEFA, adding: ""Just to be clear, we will be back here in January. 
""We won't just pack up our tent at the end of the tournament and go home to Cymru, we want to help make the world a better place."" 
Mr Mooney said the team ""really fancy our chances in this [World Cup] group"", adding ""we have a really good side"".
But he was quick to point out the tournament was about far more than football for the nation. 
It is not just the players being showcased to the globe but the culture and language, he said. 
""The bucket hat carries the words Gorau Chwarae, Cyd Chwarae [the team's moto - 'best play is team play'] and Ben Davies spoke in Welsh at a World Cup press conference for the first time ever yesterday. 
""It feels like a Gwyl Cymru [Welsh festival] is happening.""
For the first minister, it was more important to be in Qatar than not. 
Mr Drakeford's visit to the World Cup has drawn criticism, but he said the bucket hat ""will be seen by thousands and thousands of people from around the world in the coming weeks and is a symbol of the fact Wales are here, which is very important to us as a small nation"". 
He said the World Cup would ""take the name of Wales into living rooms across the world, many of which would never have heard of Wales before"".
""So it's an incredible opportunity to explain to people what we are as a nation - an outward looking nation where rights matter.""
Mr Drakeford flew in Saturday night and said he had not seen anything to concern him in ""the very brief time I have been here"".
""As I said in the run-up to coming here, there are concerns and reservations you have to take seriously,"" he said.
""But, in the end, we decided being here was more important.""
Mr Drakeford added: ""When you see the Welsh flag flying with the other 31, and those countries are all represented, it is important we are also here.""
He said he has a number of meetings with ""very senior people"" in the business industry planned and would be building ""major cultural relationships"" on his two day visit. 
Asked what the tangible benefits are of government delegations going to events such as this and the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, he said they are never known at the time but ""realised some months after when orders come through to Welsh companies and they have trade opportunities"". 
He said Â£2m spent on promoting Wales in Qatar would be returned ""many, many times over"", with the tournament creating huge exposure.
He also described the bucket hat as ""not just a work of art but with a very practical use as well"". 
""If you are at Heathrow Airport and lost and spot a bucket hat,"" he joked, ""then follow it and you can be sure you will end up in Doha.""
first minister will meet the Wales squad later on Sunday with a simple message. 
""I will tell them no pressure at all,"" he said.
""You are here to play football and to dare to dream, to go further if you can, but being here is the most important thing, an enormous achievement, and I hope the team spirit will sustain them through."" 
Legendary striker Ian Rush described Euro 2016 as ""special"" and that he wanted Wales on the biggest stage to become a regular occurrence. 
""I'm looking forward to seeing all the fans here, and singing,"" he said."	/news/uk-wales-63689381
sports	Badminton Horse Trials: Laura Collett sets record score to win event for first time	"Olympic gold medallist Laura Collett set the lowest score in the 73-year history of the Badminton Horse Trials as she won the event for a first time.
Collett won the Â£100,000 top prize on horse London 52 with a final score of just 21.4 penalties.
32-year-old was 4.6 penalties ahead of British world champion Ros Canter on Lordships Graffalo.
""I am in a dreamworld,"" said Collett. ""My goodness, that horse. He just jumped higher and higher out there.""
She added: ""He is just exceptional, and he has truly shown the world everything that I always believed in him.""
London 52 was also the horse she won gold on in team eventing at last year's rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
Oliver Townend, Collett's fellow GB gold medallist, came third making it a first all-British Badminton podium since 2002.
ging was the first Badminton since 2019 because of the coronavirus pandemic and Collett said: ""We have missed it and we've missed the crowds. It is great to be back.
""This horse owes me nothing. He has given me my first five-star win [at Pau in France two years ago] and an Olympic gold medal, and yesterday was the biggest, most intense cross-country course he has ever seen."""	/sport/equestrian/61373713
sports	Jade Jones: Anxiety led to Tokyo Olympic disappointment	"Double Olympic taekwondo champion Jade Jones says she ""wasn't in a good place"" at last summer's Tokyo Games after suffering from anxiety in lockdown.
Welsh fighter had been hoping to win an historic third consecutive Olympic gold but lost her first fight.
29-year-old says she has learned the lessons and believes she can still win gold again at Paris 2024.
""I didn't realise how much lockdown affected me,"" Jones told BBC Sport Wales.
""I haven't really spoken about it because it's not the kind of thing I do. But I was struggling with a lot of anxiety in lockdown and had never really experienced that before.
""I was petrified to go near my family, thinking I was going to pass on this deadly thing - like everybody was. I was over-thinking everything. That's where it started from.
""On top of putting all that pressure on myself and being locked down as well. Then at the end of it, what normally helps is my family being there to cheer me on - whereas it was just totally different [in Tokyo].
""It was dead. It didn't even feel like an Olympics. I just struggled to get into that zone mentally and in taekwondo, one little mess up in that two minutes and you're out. Your Games are over.""
Jones, who has now set up a scholarship to help young female athletes achieve their own sporting dreams, lost her opening bout to Kimia Alizadeh of the Refugee Olympic Team.
Now, exactly nine months on from that day in Tokyo, the 2012 and 2016 champion is in good spirits.
Jones has returned to competitive action - winning gold in her first tournament since the Games, the President's Cup, in February.
Flint fighter, who was also the reigning world champion going into Tokyo, also admits that the build-up to her third Olympics was the first time in her career she had let the hype affect her.
Prior to the Games no British woman in any sport had won three consecutive Olympic golds.
She credits sports psychologists, her family, best friend and British teammate Bianca Walkden and former GB taekwondo Olympian Sarah Stevenson for helping her through the aftermath of Tokyo.
Each was there for a coffee, a chat or a laugh as Jones processed what was as much a shock as it was a disappointment.
It has left behind a renewed determination for success.
She is targeting the upcoming European Championships and Grand Prix series.
And one eye is already on qualifying for her fourth Olympic Games in Paris in 2024 - where she still believes she can win that third gold.
But it is a determination underpinned with pragmatism after her time in Tokyo.
""I've learnt so many lessons,"" she continued.
""One of those is enjoying it again and not putting too much expectation on everything. Trying to just do my very best at each competition and see where it gets me.
""I hope I will definitely enjoy the journey a lot more this last couple of years.
""My first competition back was amazing. I fought five real tough opponents. And obviously it was a dream comeback to stamp my foot on the ground to say I'm still here. Tokyo was a fluke and a one-off.
""I'm going to carry on because I still believe I can get that third medal,"" she added.
""But it's just that realisation that it's tough. I could go again and lose my first fight again. So it's about being realistic that it might not be a fairytale ending - but I'm going to give it my best.""
Paris 2024 would be the final chapter in Jones's remarkable taekwondo story. She is now thinking about the next generation.
In December she launched a scholarshipexternal-link - aiming to find and support young female athletes in Wales.
She has just selected her first two athletes - Beth Christy (taekwondo) and Anastasia Blease (wheelchair basketball). The teenagers will now receive financial support, but also advice and guidance from Jones herself.
""When you do get to the top - I'm all cushty now in the [GB Taekwondo] academy,"" she said. ""I've got my training there and don't have to think about anything. It's easy to forget where you've come from.
""They're just two amazing, inspirational girls. You can tell they're really hungry and they know what they want. I see myself in them.
""I was very lucky to have supportive parents but we didn't have money - I've come from nothing. I remember those days of going round pubs with an ashtray to try to get a little bit of money to get to the Youth Olympic qualifiers.
""You realise that so many kids out there either don't have the parent backing or don't have the money. It's just lots of wasted talent. 
""So to be able to give back and be in this position now to help somebody else just shows how special sport is. It's not always about the gold medals at the end, which are obviously nice.
""Giving back is definitely something special to me."""	/sport/wales/61222480
health	Ambulance staff in England vote for strike action	"Members of two unions representing ambulance staff have voted for strike action in England and Wales as the NHS pay dispute deepens.
Paramedics, call handlers and other staff at 10 ambulance services have backed a walkout in the ballots run by Unison and the GMB.
Strikes are likely to start before Christmas, but the rules requiring emergency care to be provided mean their impact will be limited.
Nurses are walking out in December.
Strikes on 15 and 20 December will affect a quarter of frontline services in England and nearly all of those in Wales and Northern Ireland.
Unions have suspended industrial action in Scotland while they consider a new pay offer.
GMB members at nine ambulance services and Unison members at five backed strikes. 
Only the East of England service will not be affected.
Unison - the biggest union in the health service - also balloted members at more than 200 other NHS organisations, including hospitals, mental health teams and community services. 
Alongside ambulance staff, they also represent cleaners, porters, nurses and health care assistants.
Only three NHS organisations backed strike action with the turnout too low at the others.
But a strike by Unison members will take place in Northern Ireland across ambulance and other NHS services on 12 December as turnout requirements are lower there.
Unison general secretary Christina McAnea said with ambulance services struggling to respond to calls - the response times are the longest since modern records began - staff there felt they had no choice.
Just last week, the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives warned patients were dying because of the ""crippling delays"".
Ms McAnea said until the government acts on wages, staff shortages would not be addressed and delays would continue.
But she added: ""Patients will always come first and emergency cover will be available during any strike.""
Have you experienced a long wait for an ambulance or at A&E?  Get in touch.
It will now be up to ambulance managers to negotiate with unions to decide on the exact level of cover.
Most at risk will be the lowest category 999 calls that do not require patients to be taken to hospital, and transport services between hospitals.
five regional services that voted for strike action are London, North West, North East, Yorkshire and the South West.
Patients around the UK will face widely different levels of care as a result of the looming NHS strikes in December.  
Because of turnout rules for strike ballots to be valid some trusts wont see any disruption. But it will be a very different story at neighbouring hospitals and ambulance services affected by walkouts. 
Ambulance staff staged four hour strikes over pay in late 2014 - emergency care was maintained but there were long waits for some cases including fractures and falls.  Military backup was needed. 
me the NHS is under much greater strain and the walkouts may well be longer. The Royal College of Nursing has never taken this level of action before so the strikes will take the NHS into uncharted territory. 
Crucially the precise definitions of the emergency care which will be maintained have not been finalised. Operations, appointments and even some cancer care will be postponed at a time of growing waiting lists and warnings of intense winter pressures.  
While talks progress in Scotland with strike calls suspended there appears to be deadlock in the UK's other nations.
uncement of the ballot comes as the Royal College of Nursing announced which hospitals and other NHS services will be affected by its strike on 15 and 20 December.
Nurses at a quarter of NHS trusts in England will be involved, along with nearly all services in Northern Ireland and Wales.
It will affect leading cancer centres and children's hospitals, including London's Great Ormond Street Hospital.
r two main ambulance unions, GMB and Unite, are expected to announce the results of their strike ballots in the coming days.
All the unions have asked for above-inflation pay rises.
But the governments in England and Wales have given NHS staff an average rise of 4.75%, with staff guaranteed a minimum of Â£1,400.
England Health Secretary Steve Barclay said paying what was being asked for was ""unaffordable"" and he pointed out the award met the requirements of the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body.
""I'm hugely grateful for the hard work and dedication of NHS staff and deeply regret some will be taking industrial action - which is in nobody's best interests as we approach a challenging winter,"" he added.
Strike action has been suspended in Scotland after a fresh pay offer was made, which unions are consulting on."	/news/health-63806656
entertainment	Sites ban gamer who removed Spider-Man Pride flags	"A modification to the new PC version of the Spider-Man Remastered video game removing its LGBTQ+ Pride flags has been banned by two gaming sites.
Players are able to modify some video games by adding new features such as weapons and locations.
rson who replaced Pride flags with the USA flag in Spider-Man was banned on Nexus Mods and ModDB.
Nexus Mods director Robin Scott told users who disagreed with this decision to ""delete your account"".
resence of LGBTQ+ Pride flags in Spider-Man Remastered was supported by fans who were in favour of more in-game LGBTQ+ representation when it was first released in 2018. 
game was released for PC last week.
Nexus Mods said the modification was ""very clearly done deliberately to be a troll mod"".
Game modification sites like Nexus and Mod DB allow users to upload their own tweaks or edits to a game which can be downloaded and implemented for other users, to enhance their playing experience.
Modifications, or mods, can range from changing colours and surroundings in games to adding new characters and storylines within existing worlds.
modifications can even result in the creation of entirely new games. 
first game in the popular Counter-Strike franchise was initially developed as a mod for the 1998 first-person shooter blockbuster Half-Life.
Mr Scott said in a blog post on Wednesday that the upload of the Spider-Man Remastered mod had sparked ""some silly drama"" on Nexus's site.
""The mod replaced the very few Pride flags the game actually has, with the already prevalent USA flag texture from the game,"" he added.
He said the upload was removed and its creator was banned from Nexus Mods for violating the company's policies. 
which could be considered provocative, discriminatory or abusive towards ""any real-world individual or group"" may be moderated. 
""In regards to the replacement of Pride flags in this game, or any game, our policy is thus: we are for inclusivity, we are for diversity,"" Mr Scott added.

business	UK faces worst downturn of any advanced economy, OECD says	"UK economy will suffer a bigger blow from the global energy crisis than other leading nations, according to international body the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
UK will contract by more than any other nation in the G7 group next year, it said.
Growth in the US and the eurozone will be weak, but Germany is the only other major economy expected to shrink.
OECD forecasts a ""significant growth slowdown"" globally in 2023.
ks to the strength of emerging economies, the world economy will grow by 2.2% next year, the OECD's latest report predicts.
But the war in Ukraine was affecting economies unevenly, the OECD said, with European countries bearing the brunt of the impact on business, trade and the spike in energy prices. 
G7 includes the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. While growth is expected to be weaker in most countries in the group, only Germany and the UK will contract, the OECD predicts.
OECD expects the UK's economyto shrink by 0.4% in 2023 to be followed by shallow growth of just 0.2% in 2024.
By contrast, last week the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted the UK would shrink by 1.4% next year, although it also predicted stronger growth, of 1.3% in 2024. The OBR said that would lead to the biggest drop in living standards on record.
Earlier this month the Bank of England predicted the downturn could last for two years.
Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to fall by 0.3%, the OECD report says.
Of the wider group of G20 countries, only Russia, which is subject to economic sanctions, is predicted to fare worse than the UK.
OECD, an intergovernmental body that focuses on economic policy, lays some of the blame for the UK's poor performance on the Energy Price Guarantee, the scheme to support household and business energy bills.
While subsidising energy bills reduces the immediate headline inflation rate, the OECD warns that it will add to overall demand in the economy, increasing inflationary pressures in the medium-term. That in turn would require the Bank of England to raise interest rates further and add to the cost of servicing debts.
""Better targeting of measures to cushion the impact of high energy prices would lower the budgetary cost, better-preserve incentives to save energy, and reduce the pressure on demand at a time of high inflation,"" it said.
UK government is moving away from universal support for energy bills after this winter, the prime minister's spokesman pointed out. 
""We're taking a different approach post-April to the energy support, targeting it towards the most vulnerable,"" he said.
In response to the OECD's forecast for the economy, he said this year the UK was forecast to be the fastest growing economy in the G7.
""These are challenges that are affecting different countries at slightly different times,"" he said. 
""We emerged from the pandemic faster than many other countries in Europe. But some of these challenges are shared,"" he said. 
Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: ""We are forecast to be the only OECD economy that will be smaller in 2024 than it was in 2019.
""This is the Tory doom loop. A low growth spiral leading to higher taxes, lower investment, squeezed wages and poor public services.""
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney described the OECD forecast as a ""damning verdict"" and said a succession of Conservative chancellors this year had wrecked hope of growth.
OECD said UK inflation - which hit a 41-year high of 11.1% in October - is likely to peak at the end of this year but remain above 9% in early 2023, slowing to 4.5% by the end of next year.
rganisation expects UK interest rates to rise from their current level of 3% to 4.5% next April and unemployment to rise to 5% by the end of 2024. 
f paying for help with energy bills showed up on the government's accounts in October, as households began receiving the first tranche of a Â£400 subsidy, and the lower Â£2,500 energy price cap came into effect.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that these schemes together cost Â£3.4bn in October.
ushed up government borrowing - the difference between government spending and tax income - to Â£13.5bn last month, the ONS said.
Although the figure was Â£4.4bn higher than last year it was lower than analysts had expected.
ONS said that borrowing in the financial year to date - covering April to October 2022 - was Â£84.4bn, although this was Â£21.7bn less than in the same period last year."	/news/business-63704841

business	Airlines told to cancel flights to stop travel chaos	"UK airlines have been told to cancel flights they can't deliver this summer to stop a rerun of May's travel chaos. 
government and the aviation regulator wrote to carriers on Tuesday telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable"".
rlier cancellations were ""better"" than axing flights at the last minute.
It comes after tens of thousands of passengers have been affected by cancellations and delays at airports.
roblem was particularly bad during Easter and last month's half-term school holiday, and British Airways, TUI and Easyjet have apologised. 
Staff shortages have been blamed, after thousands of airline jobs were cut during the pandemic and have yet to be replaced despite a spike in post-pandemic travel demand. 
In their joint letter, the Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority set out five ""specific expectations"" for the sector.
wrote: ""We think it's important that each airline reviews afresh its plans for the remainder of the summer season until the end of September to develop a schedule that is deliverable.
""Your schedules must be based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available, and should be resilient for the unplanned and inevitable operational challenges that you will face.
""While cancellations at any time are a regrettable inconvenience to passengers, it is our view that cancellations at the earliest possibility to deliver a more robust schedule are better for consumers than late notice on-the-day cancellations.""
r stated that airlines must ""keep consumers informed"" about their rights during disruption, such as having ""sufficiently staffed call centres and user-friendly digital channels"".
It also urged airlines, ground handlers, air traffic control and the Border Force work more closely to try to prevent problems. 
Airlines and unions told MPs on the Commons Business Committee on Tuesday that the staffing shortages blighting the industry were likely to persist this summer.
Oliver Richardson, national officer for civil air transport at the Unite union, told MPs it was unlikely the situation would be fixed ""unless we work together"". 
Representatives from BA, Easyjet and ground handling firm Swissport said they also faced long delays to get security clearance for new staff. 
Swissport's UK boss, Jude Winstanley, said it had hired 3,000 people since the start of the year, but it was taking up to 90 days to get them a full airside pass due to the referencing process.
According to the CAA, up to 4% of UK flights were cancelled during half term and the Platinum Jubilee weekend - up from the usual rate of 1%. 
Boss Richard Moriarty called the situation distressing and unacceptable, adding that the industry needed to get a grip - although he said it was ""not solely a UK specific issue"".
re have been calls for EU aviation workers to be added to the government's shortage occupation list, but aviation minister Robert Courts denied this would help.
He told the committee that EU HGV drivers - another industry facing shortages - had been offered up to 5,000 visas to fill gaps in the UK, and only 27 had come forward.
""If there were spare workers in Europe they would be in Schiphol [Amsterdam airport],"" he said.

health	Nurses' strike: Services affected as staff stage 12-hour walkout	"'Nurses are fatigued and heartbroken'
Nurses across Northern Ireland having joined colleagues in England and Wales in the largest NHS strike in its history. 
12-hour strike began at 08:00 GMT, with nurses across Northern Ireland coming out in force. 
A number of non-emergency care services were disrupted and outpatient appointments postponed. 
Emergency care was still provided, as under trade union laws life-preserving care must remain.
A further day of strike action is also planned for Tuesday, 20 December. 
Royal College of Nursing (RCN), a trade union that represents almost 500,000 nurses across the UK, said staff had been given no choice but to take strike action after ministers refused to reopen pay talks.
UK government has said the RCN's demand for a 19% pay rise - or a raise 5% above RPI inflation - was unaffordable.
was the second time in three years that nurses in Northern Ireland took to the picket line to appeal for safe staffing and fair pay.
Denise Kelly, a nurse of 30 years who is also the national chair of the RCN trade union committee, was striking outside of Antrim Area Hospital - she told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that the strike was about patient safety, because the NHS cannot attract enough staff into nursing. 
re are nearly 3,000 nursing vacancies in Northern Ireland.
""We're under pressure, services are compromised each and every day.  We know that Northern Ireland had the highest waiting lists in the whole of the United Kingdom,"" she added.
""This is why we're here today, we're wanting to do something about that.""
She said she believed nurses had public support, despite the disruption for patients. 
""The health secretary - they are flagging up patients' appointments being cancelled today - nurses did not create these waiting lists, we did not create these pressures. 
""We're here to advocate and fight for [patients] as well,"" she said.
On the picket line outside Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, Laura McClintock said nurses had to strike to ""advocate for patient care"". 
""No nurse enters the profession expecting to be rich but things at the moment are so desperate, we are haemorrhaging staff.
""I love my job, love my patients, but what I see is people are struggling, nurses are struggling.""
Ursula Barrett, who works in the emergency department (ED) at the South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) in Enniskillen, also said nurses were concerned about providing a safe service.
""Every ED, every ward, there's breaches, there are no beds, there's no patients being able to be discharged to create beds.
""I could be one of those patients or any of our relatives could be one of those patients,"" she said. 
BBC News NI south west reporter Julian Fowler said staff at SWAH were dealing with freezing temperatures on the picket line. 
Rush-hour drivers in Belfast sounded their horns in support as they drove past the City Hospital, where nurses have a picket line beside a busy commuter road.
Although this is the first ever UK-wide RCN walkout, members of the union here in Northern Ireland have gone on strike before.
On a similarly cold a December day in 2019, they took to the picket lines over similar issues. 
Back then, as now, there was no devolved government due to a crisis at Stormont. 
revious strike was regarded as a catalyst for ending the political impasse after three years. 
While pay negotiations are carried out nationally, the devolved government generally pays out the salaries.
wer vacuum in Northern Ireland adds more difficulties - and many would say, causes more frustration - in this dispute. 
He said drivers had been sounding their horns in support despite disruption to services. 
Across the Western Trust, which operates SWAH, 587 outpatient appointments were postponed because of the strike. 
Eight planned inpatient and day case procedures were also cancelled.
Eleven GP practice treatment rooms, which are managed by the trust, remained closed on Thursday and community nursing services were reduced. 
RCN said it was campaigning for a pay rise of 5% above the RPI inflation rate to overcome real-terms pay cuts, which, it said, has left nurses 20% worse off since 2010. 
Prior to the strike, in a statement, the Department of Health said fragile services would inevitably be further impaired by the strike and that the reality is there are no quick and simple solutions to the pressures facing the health service.
urses' strike came three days after health sector workers from three of Northern Ireland's biggest unions held a 24-hour strike over pay and conditions.
On Monday, pay talks between Health Secretary Steve Barclay and Pat Cullen, the head of the RCN, failed. 
Ms Cullen said the health secretary refused to discuss pay in their meeting and therefore strikes would go ahead as planned on 15 and 20 December. 
A spokesperson said the health secretary told Ms Cullen that any further pay increase would mean taking money away from front line services and tackling the post-Covid backlog. 
RCN said its pay demands follow years of squeezes on nurses' salaries, which have not kept up with the rising cost of living. 
Some patients at Antrim Area Hospital, whose appointments were not cancelled on Thursday, voiced their support for the strike on BBC News NI's Evening Extra programme. 
One patient stated that nurses needed to be rewarded for getting the general public through the pandemic.

""We need a solution, what it is I don't know but I don't really agree with striking, not for nurses.""

firm said it had 221.1 million subscriptions across its three streaming platforms as of 2 July.
rasts with rival Netflix which has been losing customers.
But Disney warned that its loss of streaming rights for cricket in India would reduce its subscriber growth compared to previous forecasts. 
firm, which also owns general audience television platform Hulu and the sports-focused ESPN+, said demand for its Disney+ product remained strong. 
Pandemic lockdowns provided a boost to streaming services like Disney, but the easing of Covid restrictions doesn't seem to be preventing it attracting new customers.
mpany added 14.4 million Disney+ accounts in the quarter, many of them outside of the US - far more than analysts had expected.
Later this year it will launch a new ad-funded service, which will still be charged at the current subscription rate of $7.99. The charge for the ad-free service will rise to $10.99 per month.
firm plans to launch its ad-funded service outside the US next year.
Executives said they do not expect the rise in prices to put off customers over the long term. The firm is also seeing strong interest from companies hoping to advertise on the new service, they said.
""We are in a position of strength with record upfront advertising commitment,"" chief executive Bob Chapek told analysts in a conference call to discuss the firm's financial results.
Disney's subscriber gains have come at a hefty cost, with its streaming business losing $1.1bn in the quarter.
Executives said they expect losses to peak this year, In the meantime, a strong rebound in attendance at its theme parks since the worst of the pandemic has provided the firm with a large financial cushion.
revenues in the April-June period jumped 26% from last year, pushing profits to $1.5bn.
Shares in the company jumped more than 6% in after-hours trade after the firm shared its results.
Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, called it a ""pivotal moment in the streaming wars"" saying Disney had more room to grow than arch-rival Netflix.
Netflix lost nearly one million accounts in the most recent quarter, putting its membership total at 220.67 million.
just behind Disney at more than 221 million subscriptions. Disney counts each subscription to a streaming platform separately, meaning customers who pay for more than one service are counted more than once.
""[The results] firmly underline my belief that Disney is at a different phase of growth to Netflix,"" said Mr Pescatore. ""There are still millions of users to acquire as it continues to expand into new markets and rolls out new blockbuster shows."""	/news/business-62500520

sports	Winter Paralympics: How did the Great Britain team fare in Beijing?	"Great Britain have ended the Beijing Winter Paralympics with six medals - a gold, a silver and three bronzes from the alpine skiers and a snowboarding bronze.
It was was one short of the haul from Pyeongchang four years and came from the biggest GB team at a Winter Paralympics since 1994 in Lillehammer.
However, it did see them reach the UK Sport medal range of five to nine and they also secured some top-six finishes to strengthen their reputation.
Check out the information below to see how each member of the 24-strong British team fared in China.
Britain's most successful winter sport continued its run of success with all five medals coming from the visually impaired skiers. Brothers Neil and Andrew Simpson won the first Paralympic or Olympic gold on snow for GB men with success in the super-G and also claimed a super-combined bronze. Menna Fitzpatrick added to her gold, two silvers and a bronze from Pyeongchang with another silver and bronze - this time with guide Gary Smith. And after two silvers and a bronze four years ago, Millie Knight and Brett Wild added another bronze in the downhill.
Para-ice hockey has been part of the Games programme since 1994 in Lillehammer, but Great Britain have never won a medal and last competed in the sport at the 2006 Games in Turin, finishing seventh. That team included Richard Whitehead who went on to win Paralympic gold in athletics at 2012 and 2016.
No GB team in Beijing
Including both cross-country skiing and biathlon, it has been part of the Paralympic programme since the first Games. GB have two bronze medals through seven-time Paralympian Peter Young in the 10k B1 event in 1984 and then 10 years later in the 5km classical technique. Scott Meenagh, in his second Games, had GB's best finish in Beijing with sixth in the biathlon individual event.
Made its debut in Sochi in 2014 with men's and women's snowboard cross events while banked slalom events were introduced four years later. Ollie Hill won GB's first medal with bronze in the banked slalom in Beijing.
Wheelchair curling made its first Paralympic appearance in 2006 when GB won silver, losing in the final to Canada. There was also a dramatic bronze in Sochi in 2014. But they missed out on the play-offs in Beijing for the second Games in a row, finishing eighth, one place lower than in Pyeongchang."	/sport/disability-sport/60017260

Â£324 payment would be made directly into bank accounts between now and 23 November, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said.

A first grant of Â£326 was paid earlier in the year and, together, they are designed to assist with rising bills.
upport, totalling Â£650, is for those across the UK on certain benefits, including Universal Credit and pension credit. It is the largest part of direct financial assistance from the government to tackle costs such as energy bills.

Connor, 40, lives in the south west of England and says he has not yet received his latest cost-of living-payment.
With bills going up, he said he had planned his finances around receiving the payment this week.
""I'm annoyed there was no explanation about who gets the payment first. Some have already received their payment - they are the ones who receive disability payments. All I received was a text message saying I'd receive it some time between 8 and 23 November.
""That date range means I can't really plan properly - I was hoping to spend some of it on food and day-to-day stuff,"" adds Connor. ""I'm checking my bank account every hour to see if it's landed.""

health	Hasnath Miah: Tributes to 'Didcot hero' takeaway owner	"ributes have been paid to an Indian takeaway owner who donated thousands of meals during the Covid pandemic.
Hasnath Miah, 49, fed homeless people, the low paid and key workers, Oxfordshire County Council said.
Before his death on Thursday, he announced that he would give away meals to those in need on Christmas Day.
South Oxfordshire councillor Ian Snowdon said: ""His kindness and generosity made him a true hero of Didcot.""
Mr Snowdon added: ""He offered to deliver food to NHS staff and volunteers, even though [the pandemic] was a difficult time for his business.""
Oxfordshire county councillor, Sally Povolotsky, said: ""He was an endless giver with an extremely big heart. There are not many people like Hasnath left in the world.""
Mr Miah's family said he died in Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital after suffering a stroke.
In August 2021, he won an award from the High Sheriff of Oxfordshire for his efforts since the first lockdown.
Oxfordshire county councillor John Howson told the ceremony: ""He gave away more than 7,000 free hot meals. He will never turn away anyone that is hungry.
""He went on to host free meals for young carers every month. He has done all this off his own back and asks for nothing in return.""
In November, Mr Miah posted on Facebook that his takeaway Indian Dream would be open on Christmas Day. 
He wrote: ""Free dinner for homeless and people live alone and older people. I love to cook for you. I know how pain full is live alone.""
Anna Gatrell, who organises annual free Christmas Day lunches in Didcot, said Mr Miah came to two of her events when he first arrived in the town.
She said: ""He was homeless in Reading and when he came to Didcot he was astounded by the kindness of people.
""When [his business] became a success he decided to give back to the community of Didcot who made him feel at home and welcomed him.""

business	'Warning lights flash' as more workers seek help, says Citizens Advice	"""warning lights are flashing red"" as the number of people in work seeking crisis support has more than doubled in two years, according to a charity.
Citizens Advice says it referred 6,983 employed people for crisis support between July and September this year.
mpares with 2,780 people in the same period in 2020.
figures come as the cost of living is rising at the fastest rate for 40 years.
""Every day, our advisers hear stories of people skipping meals, going without essentials and then coming to us when they simply can't cut back any more. This cannot continue"", said Morgan Wild, Head of Policy at Citizens Advice. 
""We have seen the difference government support can have but the warning lights are still flashing red for the future,"" he added.
rity also said that the number of people supported this year so far had already exceeded those across the last three years. 
figures also represent a sharp from last year, when 4,291 people were referred in the third quarter.
rity also warned that the number of people it is supporting could triple if the government decides not to raise benefits in line with inflation, which measures the cost of living.
government has not committed to raising benefits using this measure but the chancellor is expected to announce its decision in the Autumn Statement on 17 November.
Just over 9,000 unemployed people have received crisis support from the charity in the third quarter of this year, compared to 6,190 last year, according to its latest cost of living data.
f living is increasing at the fastest rate for 40 years, largely as a result of energy and food prices going up, with inflation currently stood at 10.1%.
A government scheme to limit typical household energy bills to Â£2,500 a year has been in place since October, but is due to end in April next year, with more targeted help to follow. 
In England, Scotland and Wales, everyone's energy bills are being cut by Â£400 over six months, with an additional Â£650 of support for lower-income households.
Citizens Advice said its data shows the government support is helping but that the impact is limited according to its figures, and there's concern about what happens when support measures end.
""We need action which matches the scale of this crisis. At a minimum, benefits must be increased in line with inflation at next week's Autumn Statement and further energy support should be offered to those on the lowest incomes,"" Mr Wild said.
rity said that as energy bills have risen, more and more people are looking for practical advice on how to make their homes more energy efficient to reduce costs.
Consumer Affairs Correspondent Colletta Smith has some tips for cutting costs in your home.
It is also continuing to see record numbers of pre-pay gas and electricity customers who cannot afford to top up their meters. 
It saw a small fall in the number of people who couldn't afford to top up their pre-payment meters in October, which it attributes to the first tranche of the government support payments, but added it was still the third highest month on record. 
So far this year, the charity has already seen more people unable to top up than the total number of people seen in the five previous years combined. 
In addition to the number of people unable to top up, the charity said it was concerned about the high number of people having pre-payment meters forcibly installed because they're falling into debt with their energy companies. 
week, the BBC reported that a rising number of households are having their energy smart meters remotely switched to pre-payment meters by their supplier, without their permission. 
Citizens Advice said that energy debt is on the rise, with its total value now almost twice what it was in 2019 and that overall, it had never seen a higher proportion of people in negative budget - with more essential spending going out, than income coming in. "	/news/business-63598748
business	No plans for windfall tax on electricity producers	"Boris Johnson has no plans to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of electricity firms before he steps down as prime minister, his spokesman said.
government said in May that oil and gas companies would be taxed an additional 25% for the next 12 months to help households with rising bills.
But the PM's spokesman said such a policy wouldn't be extended to electricity producers.
Shares in energy firms Centrica and SSE rose 3% each after the announcement.
government introduced a new tax on energy firms in May, known as the Energy Profits Levy, in a bid to raise around Â£5bn.
It came after BP and Shell both reported big profit increases as global oil and gas prices surged following increases in demand driven by the relaxing of Covid restrictions around the world, and also because of supply concerns after Russia - a major exporter of fossil fuels - invaded Ukraine.
It is hoped the windfall tax - a one-off tax that is imposed by a government on a company - on UK oil and gas producers could be used to help households seeing rising energy bills bite into budgets.
But asked on Monday whether the windfall tax would be extended to electricity generators, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""We would not seek to make any new policies or major fiscal decisions. 
""So there's no plans to do that.""
kesman said the government would ""continue to evaluate the scale of the profits and consider appropriate steps"", but there was ""no plans to introduce or extend that to that group"".
BBC has contacted the Treasury for comment.
Labour has called on the government to consider ""backdating"" its current Energy Profits Levy to January to raise ""extra tax revenue"" from oil and gas firms.
Shadow Treasury minister James Murray claimed including the extra months could raise an extra Â£1.9bn, which it urged the government to ""put towards removing VAT on domestic energy bills for the rest of this year"".
mestic energy bills could hit more than Â£3,300 a year this winter, according to the latest forecasts, having already increased Â£700 annually in April.
A set of government payments to help with bills starts to be paid next week. The government has said all UK households will receive a Â£400 discount on their fuel bills, while people on benefits will get an additional Â£650.
But Labour's Mr Murray said a total of Â£200m of public money would go towards people with multiple properties as the energy support package for households was ""cobbled together"" at the last minute.
""That is not fair. That is not a good use of public money,"" he added.
windfall tax could also hit electricity generators, including renewable energy operators, was first reported by the Financial Times.
Sources who were close to the Treasury - as they considered how to impose a windfall tax on such producers - pointed out that renewable and nuclear energy generators have also enjoyed bumper profits as electricity prices surged. They also enjoyed extra profits as they are not dependent on expensive gas to produce power.
But energy firms warned that an attempt to extend a windfall tax to renewable energy could destroy investor confidence ahead of key auctions for licences to develop new wind and solar projects.
f one of the UK's biggest investors in renewables previously said his profits from renewable energy generation were in the low hundreds of millions for a whole year, compared to the Â£7bn made by Shell and the Â£5bn made by BP in the first three months of 2021 alone."	/news/business-62121228
technology	Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes jailed for fraud	"ranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been sentenced to over 11 years in prison for defrauding investors in her blood testing start-up that was once valued at $9bn (Â£7.5bn).
former Silicon Valley star falsely claimed the technology could diagnose disease with just a few drops of blood. 
Holmes, 38, who is pregnant, tearfully told the court she felt ""deep pain"" for those misled by the scam.
She was found guilty in January after a three-month trial.
Holmes is expected to appeal against the sentence, which was handed down on Friday in a California court. 
Once hailed as the ""next Steve Jobs"", she was at one time said to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire.
She launched Theranos after dropping out of Stanford University at age 19, and its value rose sharply after the company claimed it could bring about a revolution in disease diagnosis.
But the technology Holmes touted did not work and - awash in lawsuits - the company was dissolved by 2018.
At Holmes' trial in San Jose, California, prosecutors said she knowingly misled doctors and patients about Theranos' flagship product - the Edison machine - which the company claimed could detect cancer, diabetes and other conditions using just a few drops of blood.
used Holmes of vastly exaggerating the firm's performance to its financial backers.
Jurors ultimately found her guilty on four counts of fraud, with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. But they found her not guilty on four other charges, and failed to reach a verdict on three more.
Before Judge Edward Davila issued his sentence on Friday, Holmes read a speech to the court in which she tearfully apologised to investors and patients.
rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes
""I am devastated by my failings. I have felt deep pain for what people went through, because I failed them,"" she said. 
""I regret my failings with every cell of my body,"" she continued. 
judge referred to Holmes as a ""brilliant"" entrepreneur, and told her: ""Failure is normal. But failure by fraud is not OK."" 
Silicon Valley is a place where fortunes can be made and squandered.Â It's not unusual for investors to lose big sums of money.Â 
It's also not unusual for founders to make grandiose claims about their tech.Â 
What is different about Holmes' case, though, is that Theranos' unwinding actually led to fraud charges that stuck.Â 
It is notoriously difficult to get successful prosecutions in cases of white-collar fraud in the US.Â 
When investors lose money, they often simply write it off, or pursue compensation privately.Â 
Holmes' punishment is a warning for Silicon Valley executives that there are real consequences for misleading investors.Â Â 
't a slap on the wrist, it's significant time in prison.Â 
She is required to surrender to begin serving her sentence on 27 April. 
Holmes and Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, her former business partner and lover, were charged in 2018 with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Balwani, who was tried separately, was found guilty of fraud this summer. He will be sentenced next month.
Prosecutors requested that she face 15 years in prison and pay some $800m in restitution to investors, including several high-profile figures such as former US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who testified against her at the trial, and software tycoon Larry Ellison. 
But Holmes' defence team - who argued she was well-intentioned and trying to help people - said she should spend 18 months under house arrest.
judge on Friday determined that she had caused $121m in losses to investors, including Rupert Murdoch and the family that owns Walmart. The amount she will be required to repay will be determined at a later court hearing. 
Over 130 friends, family and former Theranos employees wrote to the judge to appeal for clemency.
group noted that Holmes is a young mother. She had a son in July 2021 and is currently pregnant with her second child. 
It is not known when she is due to give birth. Her lawyers are expected to try to keep her from entering prison until after the baby is born. 
Her partner Billy Evans, in his sentencing memo to the court, told the judge that he fears for ""a future in which my son grows up with a relationship with his mother on the other side of glass armed by guards"".
Eileen Lepera, a Silicon Valley secretary who lost a chunk of her life savings by investing in Theranos, told the BBC she was ""happy"" with the sentence.
""I think it's fair, considering all the facts of the case,"" Ms Lepera said. ""She [Holmes] knew it was fraud, and she put people's lives at risk."""	/news/world-us-canada-63685131

""There are times when this country will remind you that we're not wanted and it makes me glad that I'm Nigerian because I have a community that I can still relate to,"" says the 29-year-old.
""However, Stormzy's video really made me proud to call myself a black Brit.""
Afolabi was particularly excited to see all the stars in the video - from talk show hosts to football managers.
""Take Ian Wright as an example,"" he says. 
""He's a legend that faced adversity and got into professional football at a late age and still succeeded.""
Afolabi also names Jenny Francis - who ""provided joy for so many of us"" - and Noughts and Crosses author Malorie Blackman as personally significant appearances.
In the music video Malorie walks alongside another author, Jade LB, who wrote the award winning book - Keisha the Sket. Jade told Newsbeat last year that she's an ""advocate"" for telling stories from ""marginalised communities"".
""These people and so many more played a part in shaping me and our struggles and our joy are similar in one way or another and that for me is what truly makes us black British,"" says Afolabi.
rack is named after Melissa Holdbrook-Akposoe, better know as influencer Melissa's Wardrobe - Stormzy's stylist and CEO of It's a Lifestyle Hun.
Her impact has been highlighted on social media as well.
""Understanding Melissa's influence is not a surprise to me. I'm an invested fan so I was aware for a long time and has been aware of her affiliation with Big Mike,"" says Afolabi.
""When Stormzy was on Instagram, she was always on the stories and look at the amazing job she did for him at The Met Gala. The core of us have known of Melissa and her influence for a long time, the mainstream are just catching up.""
Both Stormzy and Melissa are now in Ghana ahead of the Global Citizen concert in the country's capital Accra.

""The exodus of talent from this lay-off will reshape the whole technology industry as we know it. We're all looking out for each other and the outreach of love and support has been incredible to see,"" Mr Balmain said. 
Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, suggested some senior staff were asked to make lists of employees to be cut on their teams. 
Cryptocurrency platform Binance invested in Twitter as part of Mr Musk's takeover. Earlier, Changpeng Zhao, its chief executive, said that ""a slimmer workforce would make more sense"".
Mr Zhao, who was speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, also criticised the platform for having been slow to roll out new features, given its level of staffing.
-cutting follows criticism of Twitter's efforts to raise money by proposing to charge $8 (Â£7) a month for a ""verified"" blue check-mark.
In addition to the verification badge, those who pay could have their tweets promoted more widely and see fewer adverts.
Mr Musk has tweeted of his plan: ""We need to pay the bills somehow."" 
witter has not made a profit in several years and its number of users has remained fairly static at about 300 million a month.
Many experts suggest that Mr Musk, the world's richest man, overpaid for the company, given current economic conditions and the depressed values of many tech stocks.
But Brandon Borrman, Twitter's former head of global communications, in a BBC interview, questioned how Twitter could justify asking people to pay in order to remain on an ""equal playing field"" with other users.
It is not clear how the cuts will affect the platform's operations. Mr Musk has a reputation for being ruthless when it comes to staff.
US media reports already speak of long hours spent by some staff to meet Mr Musk's demands in the aftermath of the takeover.
In May, Mr Musk said his work ethic expectations would be ""extreme"", but less than he demanded of himself.
As part of the takeover agreement, nine members of Twitter's board departed the company, leaving self-styled ""Chief Twit"" Mr Musk as the sole director.
move was seen as cementing Mr Musk's control over the company.
Among those leaving were chairman Bret Taylor and chief executive Parag Agrawal. 
Other senior figures have also posted about leaving, or are reported to have left, including chief financial officer Ned Segal.
As senior figures left, US media reported that a number of Mr Musk's allies joined Twitter.

Outside the stadiums and on the streets, music and dance acts from around the globe are keeping fans entertained long after the final whistle."	/news/world-63879080
sports	Tokyo Olympics: GB's Josh Kerr takes 1500m bronze as Jakob Ingebrigtsen beats Timothy Cheruiyot to gold	"Great Britain's Josh Kerr claimed bronze as Norway's 20-year-old Jakob Ingebrigtsen overhauled world champion Timothy Cheruiyot for 1500m gold.
Kerr, sixth at the 2019 World Championships, was only four hundredths of a second behind Kenyan Cheruiyot and silver as he came home in a personal best three minutes 29.05 seconds.
23-year-old Scot raced smartly, hanging off the pace before coming on strong in the last 250 metres to win GB's first medal in the men's event since Peter Elliott's silver in 1988.
His time also leapfrogs him to second in an illustrious all-time British list, with Mo Farah the only man to have gone faster.
Sebastian Coe and Steve Cram are two of those to slip a place on that list, and this final was the first time since they completed a one-two at Los Angeles 1984 that Great Britain have had three men in a 1500m Olympic final.
Jake Heyward and Jake Wightman, other leading lights in Britain's new generation of middle-distance prospects, finished ninth and 10th in 3:34.43 and 3:35.09 respectively.
""This has been a hard championship for me with the first round not going great,"" said Kerr, who finished seventh in his first-round heat and had to rely on a fastest loser spot to progress.
""I had this weird confidence in myself - some may call it cockiness - when you put the effort and work in and you're surrounded by a team, like myself, you can go all the way.
""When the first medal came back to our GB camp with [women's 800m silver medallist] Keely Hodgkinson, I had to take myself away and say I want to create that for myself. I wanted to be the one everyone looks at - I'm that self-centred!""
Norwegian star Ingebrigtsen is the fastest man in the world this year over 5,000m, but opted to train his sights on 1500m instead.
He had had a grim run of form against Cheruiyot, who had won all 10 of their previous meetings over the distance, but Ingebrigtsen proved far stronger in the closing stages to reverse that trend and win the first major title of an immensely promising career in an Olympic record 3:28.32.
Netherlands' Sifan Hassan became only the second woman to do the 5,000-10,000m Olympic double as she stalked down world record-holder Letesenbet Gidey to win gold over the longer distance.
Hassan, who won 1500m bronze in the second event of her ambitious distance campaign on Friday, never looked ruffled as Ethiopia's Gidey raised the pace but failed to shake the Dutchwoman out of her slipstream.
Gidey, who has not raced since June, could not make her additional freshness count and when world champion Hassan eased past her 250 metres from home, she had no answer.
Bahrain's Ethiopian-born Kalkidan Gezahegne followed Hassan home to claim silver, with Gidey finishing third, more than six seconds behind the winner.
While falling short of a unprecedented treble, Hassan's golds at 5,000m and 10,000m mean she matches Ethiopian great Tirunesh Dibaba's achievement at Beijing 2008.
Eilish McColgan, who failed to make the 5,000m final, came ninth in a creditable 31:04.66, six seconds outside her personal best in punishingly hot and humid conditions.
m-mate Jessica Judd finished 17th.
Allyson Felix moved clear of the great Carl Lewis to become the most decorated United States track and field athlete of all time as a star-studded American team claimed women's 4x400m gold for the seventh successive time.
Felix, 35, combined with 400m hurdles gold and silver medallists Sydney McLaughlin and Dalilah Muhammad and 800m champion Athing Mu in a dominant 3:16.85 victory ahead of Poland and Jamaica.
It is Felix's 11th Olympic medal, a run that started with 200m silver as a 22-year-old at Beijing 2008.
Britain's quartet, consisting of Ama Pipi, Jodie Williams, Emily Diamond and Nicole Yeargin, finished fifth.
United States men's team repeated the women's success as Rai Benjamin, 400m hurdles silver medallist, anchored them home to gold, ahead of the Netherlands and Botswana.
Neeraj Chopra won India's first track and field gold in Olympic history as his effort of 87.58m trumped Czech pair Jakub Vadlejch and Vitezslav Vesely in the javelin.
final athletics gold of the Games went to Mariya Lasitskene, one of 10 Russians allowed to compete under her Olympic Committee flag, as the 28-year-old added her first Olympic gold to three world titles.
Lasitskene wobbled at 1.96m, which she only cleared at the third attempt, but went on to go over 2.04m, the highest of any woman this year.
Australia's Nicola McDermott claimed an emotional silver ahead Ukrainian 19-year-old Yaroslava Mahuchikh."	/sport/olympics/58129524
entertainment	Rare Harry Potter book kept in attic to be auctioned	"A rare edition of the first Harry Potter book, never released to the public, is to be auctioned after being kept in an attic for a decade.
One of only 15 copies, the leather-bound version signed by author JK Rowling was produced to mark the 15th anniversary of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
It was awarded to competition entrant Chloe Esslemont, of Cumbria.
It will be sold on 16 December and has an estimated price of up to Â£10,000.
Ms Esslemont was 16 when she took part in the 2012 competition run by book publisher Bloomsbury, which asked fans for a colourful and elaborate letter of no more than 50 words explaining why they loved the series.
Letters could only be submitted through specially-designed post boxes at participating bookshops and libraries, with the overall winner receiving one of the books and a family holiday to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at the Universal theme park in Florida.
Now working as a child practitioner, runner-up Ms Esslemont said she became a fan of Harry Potter at the age of five when she saw one of the films for the first time.
She added she had ""kept the book wrapped up in the attic for years"" but had decided to part with it as ""the money would be useful now"".
k, containing a dedication to her, is being auctioned along with her original competition entry which is in the form of a folding document inspired by the series' magical Marauder's Map.
Book expert Jim Spencer, of Staffordshire-based auctioneers Hansons, said: ""The rarest and most valuable Potter book to own is generally regarded as being one of the original 500 hardback copies of Philosopher's Stone from the first-ever print run in 1997.
""I have found 18 of those so far and the highest hammer price achieved to date [for those sold by Hansons] is Â£69,000. But this new find is particularly scarce.
""I haven't found another one for sale, or having sold, anywhere. I'm guiding broadly at Â£5,000 to Â£10,000, but who knows what will happen if two or more people are determined to own it.""

health	South East Coast Ambulance Service issues New Year's Eve plea	"An ambulance service that covers four counties has called for support from the public ahead of New Year's Eve.
South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) urged people to only call 999 for genuine emergencies.
NHS services in the South East continue to face sustained pressure, with Surrey and Sussex NHS Trust, Medway Maritime Hospital and Secamb all declaring critical incidents this month.
Demand is expected to remain high across the New Year period.
Secamb is responsible for covering Brighton & Hove, East Sussex, West Sussex, Kent, Surrey, and North East Hampshire.
Last year, the trust said it answered about 1,000 999 calls in the seven hours from 20.00 GMT on 31 December.
rating New Year's Eve are urged to plan their evenings, including how they get home, ensuring they look out for others, and, if drinking alcohol, remembering the impact excessive drinking can have on health and emergency services.
Emma Williams, Secamb executive director for operations, said: ""We have faced significant pressure on our services for many weeks but we know that New Year's Eve can bring additional challenges.""
Ms Williams wants people to celebrate ""sensibly"" and says she understands how the decisions of individuals can impact an ""already stretched ambulance service"".
""I would like to thank all our staff and volunteers for their hard work and professionalism at this busy time and urge the public to show their support by using NHS services wisely,"" she added.
ublic is asked to help Secamb manage pressure by reserving 999 for genuine emergencies and making use of alternatives such as the 111 service, when incidents are not so serious.
Meanwhile, Chief Medical Officer for NHS Kent and Medway, Dr Kate Langford, urged people to be ""very, very selective"" when using emergency services amid an ""incredibly challenging"" period due to flu and Covid.
She said using 999 or an emergency department for something not life threatening could be ""delaying the care of someone who does have a life threatening condition"".
""Anything people can do to avoid using those routes unless it really is an emergency is greatly appreciated,"" she added.

technology	Ruja Ignatova: Leaked police notes may have alerted FBI-wanted Cryptoqueen	"Ruja Ignatova, also known as the ""missing Cryptoqueen"", received police information about investigations into her $4bn (Â£3.5bn) cryptocurrency fraud before she disappeared, it is claimed.
42-year-old Bulgarian-born woman is wanted for her alleged role in running a cryptocurrency scam known as OneCoin.
Files seen by the BBC from Europol meetings suggest the FBI-wanted fugitive knew about efforts to arrest her months before she vanished. 
uments were passed to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast by Frank Schneider, a former spy and trusted adviser to Ms Ignatova.
Mr Schneider denies obtaining the documents, which he says were passed to him on a USB memory stick by Ms Ignatova. He claims metadata on the files suggests she obtained the information via her own contacts in Bulgaria. 
He is now facing extradition to the US for his alleged role in the OneCoin fraud. 
Europol said it was looking into the issue. 
Ms Ignatova disappeared on 25 October 2017 after being tipped off about intensifying police investigations into her OneCoin cryptocurrency. In June 2022, she was added to the FBI's 10 most wanted list.
files contain presentations made at an ""Operation Satellite"" Europol meeting in The Hague on 15 March 2017.
According to the documents, the meeting was attended by the FBI, the US Department of Justice and the New York District Attorney. Officers from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Dubai and Bulgaria were also present.
uments include details of US authorities having a ""high-placed confidential informant"", OneCoin bank accounts receiving investor funds, and unsuccessful efforts by the UK's City of London Police to interview Ms Ignatova.
FBI did not comment on the Europol documents, but Special Agent Paul Roberts told the podcast: ""There were investigations all around the world into her, and into OneCoin generally, many of which she had become aware of due to actions by law enforcement in other countries.""
In court, US prosecutors alleged in 2019 that Mr Schneider was the one who provided her with confidential police information, although it is not clear if the allegations relate specifically to the leaked files seen by the podcast.
He has denied obtaining the documents and said: ""When the Bulgarians participated at certain Europol meetings, it only took hours for her to get a complete rundown and get the minutes of what was said in those meetings.
""I can only deduce that it came from the circles that she was in and the connections that she had through a variety of influential personalities.""
uments show attendees from Bulgaria's Interior Ministry at the March 2017 Europol meeting. The BBC asked the ministry whether its staff could be responsible for the leak, but it did not comment. 
No other law enforcement bodies in attendance would confirm how the information got out. 
Europol told the BBC it was looking into the matter, adding: ""This complex scenario with many stakeholders makes it difficult to assess where and how such an incident might have occurred.""
US Department of Justice, New York County District Attorney's Office, and Dubai Police did not comment.
Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast on BBC Sounds - the search for Dr Ruja Ignatova continues, with a new episode about the police leak out on 19 October.

entertainment	Madchester: Woman surprises photographer who took 1991 shot	"Music fan Zonya Jeffrey's recollections of a Happy Mondays concert in 1991 remain clear, but she had long believed that memories were all she had of that day, until she found herself unexpectedly tagged in a picture on Facebook.
In 1991, the world had gone Manchester mad.
Happy Mondays, along with the likes of Inspiral Carpets and the Stone Roses, were the kings of music, comics Steve Coogan, Caroline Aherne and John Thomson were on the rise and Terry Christian's stewardship of Channel 4's youth culture show The Word was at its height.
On the outskirts of the city in Wythenshawe, the 19-year-old Zonya and her best friend Andrea Crump were high on the crest of that wave.
""At that point, people just wanted to be in Manchester,"" Zonya said.
""There was always a buzz, always an excitement - suddenly, we were part of something bigger and something cool. 
""There were these famous people from working-class families in Manchester and this represented us.
""Celebrities mixed with everyone, people blended together, there was something very special about being part of it.""
So when Happy Mondays, one of the pair's favourite bands, announced a huge show at Leeds United's Elland Road stadium, they knew they had to be there.
Also on the bill were fellow Mancunians Northside and The High, Liverpool's The Farm and The La's and DJs and regulars at Manchester's famous Hacienda nightclub, Paul Oakenfold and Mike Pickering, the latter of whom was a year away from finding international success with M People.
Zonya said Leeds felt ""like miles away"", but coaches were put on from Manchester, so the pair set off for a memorable day, wearing T-shirts adorned with the slogans ""...And on the sixth day, God created Manchester"" and ""Born in the North, return to the North, exist in the North, die in the North"".
returned home later with a head full of memories, but no other reminders of the day.
""We had no pictures of the day as we didn't want to take a camera with us in case it got stolen,"" Andrea said.
rty-one years later, the pair got Facebook notifications that they had been tagged in a picture.
Opening up the post, they were hit by an ""iconic"" image - a black and white photograph of the pair in a smiling embrace on the Elland Road pitch, surrounded by a crowd of gig-goers.
Zonya said they had almost forgotten about it and seeing it was ""brilliant"".
""We never knew who the photographer was,"" she said.
""We just remember this cool guy, saying 'Hi girls, can I take your photo?' and we said 'Yeah'.""
Andrea said that without the picture, there would be no proof they were even at the gig, as they had lost the tickets and the t-shirts were ""long gone"".
ure was taken by Richard Davis, who had moved to Manchester to study photography at the city's polytechnic and had no idea that he ""was about to walk into the global phenomenon that the media called Madchester"".
He included it in his book about the scene, titled Madchester Years 1989-91, along with images of everyone from Factory Records impresario Anthony Wilson and New Order's then-bass player Peter Hook to Coogan, Aherne and possibly the scene's most recognisable member, Happy Mondays dancer Bez.
Spurred on by the post, Zonya went in search of the book and discovered Davis was doing a signing of it in a Manchester bookshop.
She said she could not resist going along, even though she had no idea what he looked like.
Standing in front of him, she opened the book to the page with their photo on it.
""I pointed to the book and said 'that's me',"" she said. 
""He couldn't believe it.""
grapher said it had been ""such a lovely surprise"".
""I didn't know them at the time, but both were wearing Leo B Stanley-designed T-shirts, which were very popular,"" he said.
""Thirty-one years on, it was nice to finally meet her, and to thank her for letting me take her photo back in '91.
""And, of course, it was nice to finally find out her name.""
For the friends, the appearance of the photograph gave them a chance to relive a special moment, which, thanks to the designer of the T-shirts, they were also able to recreate.
Zonya said looking that 1991 shot ""makes us feel happy"".
""Happy to be a real part of history, both in Manchester and the music scene back in the day.""

Life in the Royal Family is under increased scrutiny following the release of a Netflix documentary series about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
King Charles was the first-born son of Queen Elizabeth II, and he inherited the throne on 8 September, immediately after her death at the age of 96 at Balmoral Castle.
A period of national mourning was declared, and he was formally proclaimed king two days later.
usands of people queued up to see the Queen's coffin lying in state in Westminster Hall in the Houses of Parliament in the days leading up to her funeral. 
Her funeral service at Westminster Abbey was attended by 2,000 people, including leaders and dignitaries from around the world.
usands of people lined the streets as her coffin was transported to Windsor Castle where a committal service was held. She was buried later, alongside her late husband the Duke of Edinburgh.
King is the UK head of state. However, his powers are symbolic and ceremonial, and he remains politically neutral.
He receives daily dispatches from the government in a red leather box, such as briefings ahead of important meetings, or documents needing his signature.     
rime minister normally meets the King on a Wednesday at Buckingham Palace, to keep him informed on government matters.
meetings are completely private and there is no official record of what is said. 
King also has a number of parliamentary functions:
In addition, the King hosts visiting heads of state, and meets foreign ambassadors and high commissioners based in the UK. He leads the annual Remembrance event in November at the Cenotaph in London.
King is also head of the Commonwealth, an association of 56 independent countries and 2.5 billion people. For 14 of these countries, known as the Commonwealth realms, he is their head of state.
A coronation is the ceremony at which the monarch is formally crowned. It takes place after a period of mourning for the previous sovereign.  
Elizabeth II became Queen on 6 February 1952 on the death of her father King George VI, but was not crowned until 2 June 1953. 
King Charles III's coronation will take place on Saturday 6 May 2023 at Westminster Abbey in London. He will be the 40th monarch to be invested there.

health	Hospital fined after heart patient dies in scan result mix-up	"A hospital was fined Â£60,000 after a heart patient died following a mix-up over scan results.
Luke Allard, 28, who had a heart disorder, was sent home after a doctor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) in King's Lynn read an old CT scan. 
mistake was discovered two days later, but Mr Allard suffered a fatal heart attack on his return to the unit.
guilty to failing to provide safe care and treatment, exposing him to risk of avoidable harm.
It has also apologised to Mr Allard's family.
rosecution at Chelmsford Magistrates Court was brought by the health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC). 
It said the criminal offence stemmed from the trust's failure to safely manage scan reports.
District judge Timothy King found the case against the hospital was not one of systematic failure, but was instead an isolated incident.
An inquest held two years ago, which recorded a narrative conclusion, said Mr Allard, from King's Lynn, had Marfan Syndrome and was awaiting heart surgery at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge.
genetic disorder affects connective tissue and caused the death of several members of Mr Allard's family, including his older brother in 2015.
Mr Allard had gone to the QEH in March 2019 with chest pains.
A series of tests were carried out, but a previous CT scan was assessed by the doctor looking at Mr Allard's results, which indicated he was fit for discharge, the CQC said. 
rrect report showed ""significant abnormality"" and he was recalled to the hospital when the mistake was discovered.
Mr Allard suffered a cardiac arrest due to a ruptured aortic aneurysm soon after he arrived at the hospital.
Zoe Robinson from the CQC said in a statement: ""the trust's failure to ensure its staff reviewed correct scan results is unacceptable.
""If the trust had identified and addressed the weakness of its system, it could have appropriately responded to Mr Allard's condition and provided him with the urgent care he needed"".
Ms Robinson said the hospital ""had also failed to ensure the provider of its out-of-hours radiology service issued a verbal report when a scan identified abnormalities. 
""This situation was worsened because the trust's computer system for managing scan results was outdated and incompatible with systems used by its out-of-hours radiology provider.""
For the hospital, Alice Webster, QEH acting head, said: ""On behalf of the trust, our thoughts and condolences remain with Lucas's family"".
She said the hospital ""accepts and profoundly regrets"" the failings of March 2019, adding the hospital has always had a responsible attitude to safe working in all departments. 
""We have learnt and taken measures to address and close the gaps this case clearly highlighted,"" Ms Webster said.

health	Nurses in Scotland to strike after rejecting pay deal from NHS	"Nurses in Scotland are set to strike after voting down the latest pay offer for NHS workers. 
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) Scotland members rejected an average increase of 7.5%. The union said it was planning for industrial action and would announce dates early next year. 
Royal College of Midwives (RCM) members also rejected the pay deal. 
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he was disappointed but would continue negotiations with unions.
In the RCN ballot that closed on Monday, 82% voted against the offer. 
union, which has more than 30,000 NHS members in Scotland, had asked for an increase of at least 5% above inflation - which is currently 10.7%.
Julie Lamberth, RCN Scotland board chair, said nurses had ""forcefully rejected"" the deal.
She added: ""Make no mistake - we do not want to go on strike. Years of being undervalued and understaffed have left us feeling we have been left with no option because enough is enough. 
""The ball is in Scottish government's court if strike action is going to be avoided.""
Last month, ministers tabled an improved pay offer averaging 7.5% to health workers threatening industrial action.
Annual salary rises under the proposal would range from a flat rate payment of Â£2,205 for staff in Bands 1 to 4 and up to Â£2,660 for staff in Bands 5 to 7, backdated to April.  
represents an increase of 11.3% for the lowest paid workers and delivers an average uplift of 7.5%.
Unite and Unison chose to accept the deal, however, the GMB union became the first to reject it last week.
was also rejected by 65% of midwives who voted in the RCM ballot. The union, which has about 3,000 members in Scotland, said it was considering industrial action. 
Jaki Lambert, RCM director for Scotland, said: ""Our members have spoken loud and clear - the latest pay offer by the Scottish government is simply not good enough. It goes nowhere near addressing the rising cost of living and would see many midwives actually worse off in real terms.
""Our members have been consistent throughout this process - they want a decent deal, and they are prepared to take industrial action to get one. 
""No midwife wants to do this and it is for the Scottish government to make sure that they do not feel that they are left with no other option.""
rejection of this pay offer by such a high proportion of RCN members will be a real blow for the Scottish government, which had billed it as the best and highest offer in the UK.  
It will also be disappointing for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon after she had personally intervened, meeting nursing leaders to see if there was anything that could be done to get this deal over the line.
It now leaves a complicated picture here in Scotland because some other unions, including Unison, who also represent some of the nursing workforce, have accepted the offer. Others like GMB, who represent ambulance staff, have turned it down.
I'm told there is a willingness on all sides to get back round the table and see if any more can be done, but it is hard to see where such negotiations can go.
Strikes in the new year are still not inevitable, but it they are growing ever more likely. 
Humza Yousaf said the government had made its ""best and final pay offer"" to NHS staff.
retary said: ""While I am naturally disappointed the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Nursing have rejected this offer, I respect the voice of their membership. 
""We have engaged tirelessly with trade union representatives over recent weeks and months, leaving no stone unturned to reach a record pay offer which responds to the key concerns of staff across the service.""
minister said he would be meeting with trade unions on Thursday to continue ""meaningful dialogue"".
He added: ""We are making this offer at a time of extraordinary financial challenges to the Scottish government to get money into the pockets of hard working staff and to avoid industrial action, in what is already going to be an incredibly challenging winter.
""Constructive engagement is crucial, those unions who have rejected our pay offer have all said they want to avoid industrial action, we must collectively work toward avoiding strikes taking place this winter at a time of already significant pressure for our NHS.""
Scottish Conservative health spokesperson, Dr Sandesh Gulhane, called on Mr Yousaf to ""immediately get back round the table"" with the RCN to prevent strike action going ahead.
He said: ""Scotland's NHS is on its knees due to the health secretary's mismanagement, so the last thing it can afford going into the peak winter period is industrial action.""

technology	Bradford duo behind Â£150k robberies snared by own trackers	"wo men who used high-tech trackers to monitor their victims' movements have been jailed for 15 years after being snared by their own devices.
Michael Crosdale, 28, and Robert Fairweather, 29, stole cash, jewellery and cars in raids in Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield and London in 2021.
Police described their scheme as a ""highly organised criminal conspiracy"".
men admitted conspiracy to commit burglary and were convicted of robbery following a trial at Leeds Crown Court.
goods worth more than Â£150,000 between May and September, with their scheme mainly targeting the owners of Chinese restaurants and takeaways.
racking devices fitted to their victims' vehicles enabled the pair to find out where they lived, allowing them to ransack their homes while they were out.
me was discovered after a tracker was recovered from one victim's vehicle.
Specialist investigators found the device was shown at both offenders' addresses and being deployed, regularly logged into, and recovered to be recharged as they targeted their victims.
In June, an 80-year-old man working as a customs agent was attacked and robbed outside his home in London after collecting a delivery of gold from Heathrow Airport.
Electronic evidence showed devices linked to Crosdale and Fairweather checking the tracker, and a vehicle linked to them was shown travelling to London at the time of the robbery and returning with the tracker.
Det Insp Vicky Vessey, said: ""This was a highly organised criminal conspiracy making use of tracking technology to target the victims.
""It was however that same technology, which they thought allowed them to keep their distance in the planning of these offences, that helped us to track them down.""
In addition to their 15-year jail term, Crosdale, of Manse Road, Burley-in-Wharfedale, and Fairweather, of Ranelagh Avenue, Ravenscliffe, Bradford, were also given a three-year consecutive sentence for drug and proceeds of crime offences.

technology	How India is building a pearl farming industry	"In 2016 Narendra Garwa was facing a desperate financial situation. His small book store in the village of Renwal, Rajasthan, was running at a loss.
With a family to support and little education, he searched the internet for other money-making ideas. He had some success growing vegetables in plastic bottles, but then came across a potentially more profitable crop - pearls.
""Rajasthan is a dry area with water issues. It was a challenge to think of growing pearls with limited water but I decided to try,"" he says.
Pearls are formed when a mollusc reacts to an irritant in its protective membrane. The mollusc deposits layers of aragonite and conchiolin, which together form nacre, also know as mother-of-pearl.
In the wild, pearl formation is rare so most pearls sold these days are from farmed molluscs, usually oysters or freshwater mussels. 
ur the mollusc to form a pearl, an irritant is artificially introduced into the creature. However, it is a delicate process and the mussels or oysters must be carefully handled, as Mr Garwa found.
""My first attempt was a disaster,"" he admits. Of the 500 mussels he purchased, only 35 survived. 
Mr Garwa had travelled to Kerala to buy the mussels - a journey of 1,700 miles involving a 36-hour train journey. He also used his savings and borrowed money to come up with the 16,000 rupees (Â£170; $200) needed to buy the molluscs.
In addition, Mr Garwa had dug a 10ft by 10ft pond in his back garden to keep the creatures in.
Despite the setback, he did not give up. Instead, he took a five-day course in pearl farming.
""Growing an oyster is like bringing up a baby,"" he says.
""Monitoring the the water throughout the growth period is crucial to achieving high quality and volume of produce.""
Now he has a 40ft by 50ft pond, which he treats with multivitamins and alum which maintains the correct pH level required for growth. 
urvival rate of his mussels has risen from 30% to more than 70% since becoming more familiar with the process. Mr Garwa expects to produce around 3,000 pearls this year, which he can sell for between 400 and 900 rupees (Â£4-Â£10; $5-$11).
Indian government has been encouraging pearl fishing as part of its Blue Revolution, a plan to modernise the nation's fishing industry.
Under the scheme the government pays for half the cost of setting up a pond for pearl fishing, and so far the Department for Fisheries has given financial support to 232 pearl farming ponds.
""Pearl farming is one of the most lucrative aquaculture businesses and the government is encouraging farmers to take up this farming,"" says Jujjavarapu Balaji, Joint Secretary of Marine Fisheries.
Not everyone is impressed with this wave of pearl farming activity. Critics include Gunjan Shah, who is the fifth generation of his family to be in the pearl trading business.
""The culture of pearl farming has increased in India but I think the pearls grown in every nook and corner are not of very good quality"" says the owner of Babla Enterprises, based in Mumbai.
More technology of business:
He says India is producing too many of the wrong kind of pearls.
""What India needs at present is people who can grow sea water pearls if we want to compete with China. Indian oysters are small but China has hybrid oysters which produce large pearls.
""Cultured South Sea pearls are the most valuable type of cultured pearl on the market today. These pearls come in a gorgeous variety of sizes, shapes and colours. A strand of South Sea pearls can be as expensive as $10,000 (Â£8,500) or more. They are very rarely produced in India.""
He says the government should be looking to develop this part of the industry.
In its defence, the government says it will take time to build up a competitive pearl farming sector.
""Pearl family is specialised farming, so this sector will take time to grow. The plan is to see the increase in the next three years,"" says Mr Balaji, from the Department for Fisheries.
""Once we are able to grow enough pearls for local consumption then we can focus on exports,"" he adds.
As for Mr Garwa, as well as farming pearls, he also offers courses for those who want to learn how to do it.
Reena Choudary, 28, was one of his students, and just like her tutor her first effort last year was a failure.
""I lost all the oysters - none of them were able to produce,"" she says.
But this year, she expects to produce around 1,000 pearls. 
Starting an independent business was a big leap for her, particularly as women in her region are often expected to look after the home rather than work. 
""For people like us this smells like freedom,"" she says. ""We have learnt how we can be independent, help towards contributing to the family and have a say in family matters."""	/news/business-62204515

entertainment	James Corden tells viewers he was 'rude' to restaurant server	"James Corden has admitted he was ""ungracious"" to a restaurant server in an incident which saw him temporarily banned from New York eatery Balthazar.
Speaking on The Late Late Show on Monday, Corden said ""it was never my intention"" to offend restaurant staff.
Keith McNally, who owns Balthazar, said last week that Corden had been an ""abusive customer"" after some errors with his orders.
He later revealed the star had since called and ""apologised profusely"".
Addressing the issue for the first time in public, Corden said of Mr McNally's claims: ""Because I didn't shout or scream, I didn't get up out of my seat, I didn't call anyone names or use derogatory language, I've been walking around thinking that I haven't done anything wrong.
""But the truth is I have made a rude, rude comment. And it was wrong. It was an unnecessary comment, it was ungracious to the server."" 
On the latest episode of his US show, Corden said his remarks had been ""in the heat of the moment"" but said he would ""apologise in person"" to the staff at Balthazar.
Corden said that after seeing Mr McNally's post, in which he accused Corden of being nasty to his staff on two visits in recent months, he had ""immediately"" contacted the restaurant owner.
""[I told him] how upset I was that anybody was hurt by anything that I had done and anything that I had said and we had a good talk,"" he said.
""He appreciated the call. I was happy that we got to clear the air. And I felt like we dealt with it privately... but by this point, the story was out there and more people were upset.""
Corden's explanation is a change in tone from comments he made in interview in the New York Times over the weekend.
He told the newspaper that he hadn't ""done anything wrong, on any level,"" adding that he felt ""so Zen about the whole thing. Because I think it's so silly"".
Mr McNally posted that Corden had visited his restaurant in June and been ""extremely nasty"" after he showed a hair to the manager after his main course - the implication being it was in his food.
A second run-in followed in November, the restaurant owner said. An omelette was the cause of the rudeness and Mr McNally accused Corden of yelling and again, ""being nasty"".
Corden told The Late Late Show that the second incident occurred when his wife was accidentally served a dish she would have had an allergic reaction to.
Corden showed a series of tweets reacting to his behaviour to The Late Late Show audience, telling them: ""I get it. I totally understand. I understand everybody getting upset and I accept everybody's opinion.
""I also hate, as I said to the owner that day, that I've ever upset anybody ever.
""It was never my intention. It just wasn't. I love that restaurant. I love the staff there.
""I hope I'm allowed in again one day so when I'm back in New York I can go there and apologise in person, which is something I will absolutely do.""
Mr McNally lifted his ban last week after receiving Corden's apology over the phone, posting on social media: ""Anyone magnanimous enough to apologise to a deadbeat layabout like me (and my staff) doesn't deserve to be banned from anywhere. Especially Balthazar.""
Corden announced in April that he was stepping down as host of The Late Late Show.
He is expected to depart in spring next year. "	/news/entertainment-arts-63384455
politics	Boris Johnson did the right thing, says Scottish Tory MP	"Boris Johnson ended his bid to return as prime minister in the national interest, a Scottish Conservative MP has said. 
Since the ex-PM announced on Sunday that he would not put his name forward, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt remain in the running to replace Liz Truss. 
MP Andrew Bowie told BBC Scotland Mr Johnson had done the ""right thing"". 
Nicola Sturgeon said she was relieved that the ""ridiculous notion"" of his return was ""knocked on the head"".
race for the party's new leader was set in motion after Liz Truss was forced to stand down after 45 days in office - the shortest premiership of any UK prime minister.
Ms Truss's policy programme spooked the financial markets and her successor will be tasked with establishing stability.
Candidates with 100 or more supporters will proceed in the process, which states a winner should be announced on Friday. However, if only one candidate reaches the threshold they could become leader on Monday.
Mr Sunak is the firm favourite to replace Ms Truss as PM and could do so by as early as Monday afternoon if Ms Mordaunt fails to meet the benchmark.
According to BBC figures, which are being updated here, former chancellor Mr Sunak has 193 Conservative MPs who have publicly given him their backing, while Ms Mordaunt has 26.
question remains as to whether Ms Mordaunt can get 100 MPs to back her before nominations close at 14:00 BST.
Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme Mr Bowie, Conservative MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, said Mr Johnson - who only stood down as prime minister seven weeks ago - stepping out of the leadership race was the ""right thing to do"". 
""I think what Boris did yesterday was definitely in the national interest,"" he said. ""The last thing we need is another prolonged battle for the heart and soul of the Conservative party. 
""We need to get this done quickly and get it over with as soon as possible in the national interest so we can get the economy on a firm footing and move the whole country forward.
""A general election, even for a snap general election, by law necessitates six weeks of campaigning. That is six weeks when parliament isn't sitting and six weeks where government isn't getting down to business.""
Mr Bowie, who is backing Rishi Sunak, added: ""Looking at the numbers it was clear that had he entered the race he would have been beaten in the MP's ballot.""
Boris Johnson's final months in office were dogged by accusations he broke ministerial rules by not telling the truth about parties in Downing Street during the Covid lockdown.
He remains under investigation by the Parliamentary Standards Committee, which could lead to him being suspended from Parliament, or being kicked out as an MP.
On Sunday, Scottish Conservatives chairman Craig Hoy told BBC Scotland his colleagues were ""very frustrated"" by the UK party's leadership turmoil and wanted to focus on holding the SNP to account over independence.
first minister said people were tired of the ""Tory soap opera psychodrama"".
""It is appalling given the difficulties people across the country are living through right now,"" Ms Sturgeon said. 
She added: ""I think everybody will breathe a sigh of relief that the ridiculous notion of Johnson coming back as prime minister has been knocked on the head."" 
But Ms Sturgeon said what the next prime minster does would be more important than their personality.
""What is of profound concern to everybody, particularly to me right now, is that the Tories are about to unleash another wave of austerity on all of us. It is going to be a horror show,"" the first minister said. 
""Scottish public services, cannot withstand, in my view, another round of Tory austerity.
""We need an alternative to that and if Rishi Sunak becomes prime minister today or later in the week, as I suspect he will, what we know is that next Monday his chancellor is going to stand up in the House of Commons and unveil a round of cuts that the Scottish government and public services are going to be powerless to withstand.""
Former Conservative MEP Lord Ian Duncan said he did not think there should be a general election, despite the last one in 2019 seeming ""like a lifetime ago"", or a return to the Conservative party members deciding on their next leader.
""Right now we do need a period of stability and once we've got that stability then it is time for an election,"" he said. ""But at that point, I wonder if Ian Blackford will be shouting in exactly the same way because at that point there may well be a restoration in the fortunes of the Tory party.""
But he agreed that Mr Johnson was right not to attempt to become prime minister again. 
""Boris may well have been a vote winner but once you've shot yourself in both feet it's very hard to run a race,"" Lord Duncan said.  
""Right now we need to have a period where common sense applies to the economy and it will be judged not wholly by the people but actually by the markets themselves. The markets will determine whether the common sense is working or not."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63371577
politics	Police are solving only 1% of catalytic converter thefts, data suggests	"f thousands of catalytic converter thefts are going unsolved, with only 1% of cases resulting in someone being charged, figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats suggest.
Data from 20 police forces in England and Wales for 2017-2021 indicate a suspect was charged in only 548 cases.
Catalytic converters fitted in car exhaust systems reduce their emission of toxic gases and pollutants.
re attracted by the valuable metals the devices contain.  
Police say converters can often be removed in under a minute, and are most frequently stolen in car parks, before being sold to scrapyards, online or shipped out of the country.  
Hybrid vehicles are most commonly targeted as their metals are more valuable, but any vehicle can be at risk of catalytic converter theft.
Home Office says it has national programmes to target metal theft, including catalytic converters.
figures were disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information request.  
In the 20 police areas where full information was provided, a total of 50,223 thefts of catalytic converters were reported in the five-year period.  
Full figures from some of the biggest forces - including West Midlands Police and Greater Manchester Police - were not available. 
In the 20 force areas surveyed, the number of thefts surged from 742 reported in 2017 to 19,451 in 2020, before falling in 2021 - the first full year of the Covid pandemic - to 15,780. 
By far the highest number of thefts from 2017-2021 - 36,586 - occurred in London. Just 544 were solved. 
In Hertfordshire, in 2020, 915 cases were recorded; in South Yorkshire, the figure was 669. No one was charged in either police area in that year. 
Liberal Democrats have called for more to be done to crack down on the problem, including more visible community policing to deter thieves. 
rty said the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto promise to recruit 20,000 more police officers by March 2023 had stalled. 
Home Office figures show that by 30 September, 15,343 extra officers had been recruited. 
Richmond Park MP, and Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney said: ""There is a catalytic converter theft epidemic across many parts of the country, but far too often the gangs responsible are getting away with it.
""At the very least, people should be able to expect that if something is stolen from their vehicle it will be properly investigated.""
Victims were ""not just massively inconvenienced but often left out of pocket and hit by higher insurance costs"", she added. 
f replacing a catalytic converter is put at between Â£150 and Â£800, depending on the type of car and the complexity of the job.  
A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We recognise the impact that theft can have on victims and we want offenders charged and brought to justice in the courts.
""Since the National Infrastructure Crime Reduction Partnership was set up in 2020, there has been significant success in tackling metal theft through co-ordinated national action against scrap metal dealers -  including a marked increase in enforcement action from police and partner agencies.""
During two weeks of national action to tackle catalytic converter and other metal theft, 64 arrests were made and more than 1,000 converters and other stolen items were recovered, the spokesperson added.
Police say that although catalytic converter thefts are increasing, there are steps that can be taken to protect a vehicle.
uggest asking a car dealer for advice on approved locks or guards, registering the converter and marking it with a forensic marker.    
Alternatively, they say, try to make sure the vehicle is parked in a garage overnight, or in a secure compound if it is a commercial vehicle.  
Otherwise, police add, park in an area that is well-lit and overlooked, and try to park so the converter can not be easily reached by potential thieves. Vehicles that sit high above the road are said to be particularly vulnerable."	/news/uk-politics-64057742
business	Cardiff cafe staffed by autistic people fears closure	"A cafe ran by autistic people could be closed by new year due to an unresolved rent dispute.
In WhatsApp messages seen by BBC Wales, Cardiff's Aubergine Cafe was told its rent could increase from Â£800 to Â£1,200 per month when the tenancy renewed at the end of the year. 
Following attempts to negotiate, the cafe's ability to renew the lease hangs in the balance.
rd said they did not want to comment.
After the director of the cafe, Selena Caemawr, attempted to negotiate the rent price, they were told the landlord no longer wanted to renew the tenancy. 
However, following a community rally and an Instagram campaign, the landlord reversed their decision, but the cafe is yet to receive a renewal agreement from the landlord but will have to close by the new year if it is unable to renew.
Selena set up the cafe after facing difficulties in various jobs, often finding themselves put on extended probationary periods because they struggled to keep up with time-dependent and admin tasks.
: ""I knew I could do my job if I was supported properly. But nobody would listen to me when I told them what sort of support I needed. It's like they didn't believe me.
""I remember writing a post on Facebook where I said that the problem with being autistic and in the workplace is that everyone else isn't autistic. And if they were just everything would just work better.""
From there, a spark was born for Aubergine Cafe - it started as a pop-up business and then moved to its current home in Riverside in 2019. 
It is run entirely by neurodiverse people and has an almost-silent coffee machine, adjustable lighting and staff organise cutlery outside of opening hours as autistic people sometimes struggle with sensory overload. 
As well as working to support autistic people into full-time professional employment, Aubergine CafÃ© commissions freelance neurodivergent artists to host workshops. 
Selena said: ""It's really important for us to give people proper steps into professional employment, not just volunteering opportunities.
""We want to be the role models we never got to see for ourselves.""
Sarah Smart, 24, who has a learning disability, works at Aubergine Cafe three days a week, learning about all aspects of the job. 
If the cafe closes, Sarah's ability to work is at risk: ""I know they'd find another premises, but I'd have to re-learn how to get to that place in Cardiff which would be difficult for me.
""People in the area wouldn't have the cafe local to them anymore and this would have a big impact on our community.""
Another user of the cafÃ©, who asked to remain anonymous, said the Aubergine Cafe ""made me feel like Cardiff has a place for me"" through the way it celebrates queerness and neurodivergence.
Roz Moreton, 57, discovered the cafe through her work with Disability Arts Cymru, said it was a special and vital place.
""We need more safe places not just for people to go to but for people to work at,"" said Ms Moreton.

business	Life tough for millions of households, says Sainsbury's boss	"Shoppers are ""watching every penny and every pound"", the boss of Sainsbury's has warned, as the supermarket revealed its profits had been hit by the rising cost of living.
Simon Roberts said the grocer got ""how tough it is for millions of households"" and was trying to keep prices low. 
Food prices are rising at their fastest rate in 42 years as the cost-of-living crisis squeezes household budgets.
People are also struggling with higher energy bills and rising interest rates. 
Sainsbury's said sales across the business had climbed 4.4% to Â£16.4bn in the six months ending in September. 
But the UK's second-largest supermarket also revealed a dip in profits as the business absorbed some of the impact of rising food costs and put up wages.
mpany, which also owns Argos, said underlying pre-tax profit declined by 8% to Â£340m compared with the same period last year.
Mr Roberts said: ""We will have invested more than Â£500m by March 2023 in keeping prices lower by cutting our costs... meaning we have more firepower to battle inflation.""
grocer's profits also reflect a return to normal shopping habits since the pandemic lockdowns ended.
rice of pasta, tea, chips and cooking oil has soared, according to official data, with vegetable oil going up by 65% in a year.
Overall, the price of budget food in supermarkets rose by 17% in the year to September, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Experts say the rise in the cost of groceries has been accelerated by the war in Ukraine, which has disrupted grain, oil and fertiliser supplies from the region.
Food and drink prices have also been affected by the recent weakness in the pound, which has made imported products and ingredients more expensive.
Earlier this month, a BBC survey uncovered growing concern about the squeeze on finances. Some 85% of those asked are now worried about the rising cost of living, up from 69% in a similar poll in January.
Like other supermarkets, Sainsbury's has given its staff two pay rises this year to ""reflect the current challenges households are facing"".
Sainsbury's and Argos hourly retail staff saw their pay rise from Â£10.00 to Â£10.25 an hour, and from Â£11.05 to Â£11.30 an hour in London.
grocer has said profits for the current year are set to decline as it chooses to invest more into its pricing and pay improvements for workers.
Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said Sainsbury's, like its peers, was ""stuck between a rock and a hard place"" as it faced increasing labour costs and the impact of high inflation. 
""Sales have remained robust, but the effects of the macro-economic situation are beginning to filter through into profitability,"" she said. 
Despite this Sainsbury's said it was ""well placed"" for the Christmas trading period, and to deal with further cost-of-living pressures into next year.
group is halfway through a Â£1.3bn cost-saving programme, which has seen it shut down in-store restaurants and standalone Argos shops.
It said it expected to close about 50 Argos stores this year as part of the previously announced plans, with around 25 Argos sites set to open within larger Sainsbury's shops."	/news/business-63496408
technology	London homicides driven by drugs and social media, study finds	"Drugs, missed mental health sessions and social media usage are factors driving homicides, a study has found.
London Violence Reduction Unit's (VRU) report analysed police data to better understand the causes of murder and manslaughter.
Last year, there was a record number of teenage killings in the capital, despite a national Covid-19 lockdown.
Each homicide costs the police and criminal justice system an estimated Â£800,000, the report claims. 
London's homicide rate means it would have an annual cost of about Â£120m. 
Established by the London mayor's office, the VRU study by the behavioural insights team aimed to find a framework for experts, including the police, to deliver early and targeted interventions.
Following an analysis of 50 homicides, it found:
will now use the framework to analyse another 300 cases with a view to it potentially being used more routinely in the capital.
Met Police Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has previously said he wanted to bring the number of homicides in London down to below 100 a year, from 130. 
report from the Mayor's Violence Reduction Unit suggests police are only one part of the solution. 
re are recommendations for other agencies and policy makers too, including monitoring when someone stops engaging with mental health support and providing better guidance for young people who are being targeted on social media. 
report also highlights the gaps in the data recorded on homicides and makes recommendations for the police on how that can be improved. 
Gang violence, for example, is an area where researchers say there's not enough specific information about how drugs or social media are involved, or the relationships or nature of the conflict. 
Researchers say the clues are often there, but improving the data will make it easier to spot patterns and see where current provision and policy need to be improved.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""If we are to continue reducing violence in London, it's crucial that we identify more opportunities to intervene early because I firmly believe that violence is preventable, not inevitable.""
Lib Peck, director of VRU, said: ""The foundation of the VRU's approach to tackling violence is to build an evidence base for what works and what doesn't.""

business	Uncertainty remains over some people's energy rebates	"Everyone has been promised a Â£400 rebate on their domestic energy bill this winter, to offer some relief from soaring prices.
rt of a package of government support to help people with the rising cost of living. 
But millions of people are still facing uncertainty over exactly how they will get the promised rebate.
Mobile homes can vary in size and structure, and often it is pensioners and semi-retired people who own them, paying a fee to the park owner for their pitch. 
Many park home residents have been afraid they would not receive the promised Â£400 energy rebate. Their concern prompted a petition, signed by more than 11,000 people, calling for confirmation that they will not miss out on the payment, which has been promised to every household.
While the government has stressed that they will receive the money, the mechanics of how their bill will be discounted remain unclear.
Residents do not have a direct relationship with their energy supplier, so cannot be given a straightforward rebate like everyone else. The park owner is billed by the energy firm, then the owner charges the residents for the power they use. 
""A lot of people believed they would not get [the money]. However, there is no doubt, and I have been assured by government officials, that this money will be paid,"" says Brian Doick, who lives in a mobile home in Sussex and is president of the National Association of Park Home Residents.
""This will not be a cash payment but will come in a way that covers [some of] the cost of your utility bill. It could be vouchers or something else, but I am assured you will be paid from October. We will be paid exactly the same as everyone else.""
For most regular billpayers, the rebate will arrive in six instalments, with a discount of Â£66 applied to energy bills in October and November, and Â£67 a month from December to March 2023.
A government spokesman said officials and ministers were ""urgently working"" to ensure everyone, including park home residents, received the support. 
Mr Doick, an 81-year-old retired firefighter, says support is crucial, because mobile home residents are facing inflation-linked increases to their pitch fees.
Every year, the park owner can put up the fee in line with the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation, which currently stands at 12.3%.
Many residents also have access to gas from cylinders, or tanks, outside their home, but that has also been going up in price.
Hundreds of thousands of tenants pay rent which includes bills - but the type of contract can vary. 
John Gallagher, a solicitor at housing charity Shelter, says that - in the case of a fixed rent, inclusive of bills - there is no specific legal obligation for a landlord to pass on the energy discount.
re ""at the mercy of their landlord"", he says.
However, for those who pay a variable service charge that covers gas and electricity, the landlord is not allowed to overcharge for the energy used, or make a profit on it.
""If [landlords] pocket the government support and continue to charge you the same rate for utilities or more, they may be in breach of these rules,"" he says.
National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) agrees that where tenants are being charged higher prices for the energy they use, the discount should be passed on to them by their landlord.
However, a spokesperson pointed out there would be cases where all-inclusive rents had been set without reflecting the recent surge in energy costs, in which case the landlord would be shouldering the impact of higher prices.
In principle, though, landlords with a domestic electricity connection, where a fixed cost for energy is included in the rent, ""should also be passing on the discounted payments to tenants"", the government says. 
Other tenants, such as housing association tenants on communal heating networks, who have their heating supplied through a central boiler that reaches all homes in a building, rather than having an individual boiler in their home, pay for their heating bills via service charges.
Many of these residents are vulnerable, living in supported or sheltered housing. Although the government has said they will definitely receive the Â£400 rebate, this is another group awaiting detail on how the money will get to them.
From the outset, the government has said that residents of Northern Ireland should receive the Â£400 rebate.
Energy supply is different to the rest of the UK, and the price cap that operates in England, Wales, and Scotland does not apply here. But prices have also been rising in Northern Ireland over the last year.
Without a functioning executive government at Stormont, the issue is being discussed by a taskforce set up by the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi.
A week ago, Northern Ireland Finance Minister Conor Murphy said there had been ""long overdue"" confirmation that the rebate would apply in Northern Ireland.
But he added there was no guarantee that Northern Ireland households would receive the money from October, like the rest of the UK. Instead, payments might not be made until early next year."	/news/business-62736620

business	Brexit: UK signs first US state-level trade agreement with Indiana	"UK is to sign its first trade agreement with an individual US state, with more expected this year as it attempts to show post-Brexit progress.
Memorandum of Understanding with Indiana seeks to boost the Â£1.1bn ($1.4bn) worth of goods the state already buys from the UK.
rade Minister Ranil Jayawardena will sign the agreement with the Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb on Friday.
But opposition parties said it was no substitute for a UK-US trade deal.
UK government is looking to strike agreements with about 20 states after talks on a broader US-wide trade deal stalled.
International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the Indiana agreement ""will help deliver value to UK businesses and support our areas of shared interest, such as levelling up"".
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government once saw the prospect of a trade deal with the US as a whole as one of the biggest prizes of leaving the European Union.
But hopes of a quick deal have faded since US President Joe Biden took office and raised concerns about the UK's handling of post-Brexit trade arrangements in Northern Ireland.
Instead, the UK's Department for International Trade is pushing for agreements with individual US states and cities, to help improve trade relations.
greement with Indiana is a memorandum of understanding (MoU), which is a document that sets out the key points of a non-binding economic partnership between two parties.
UK says its agreement with Indiana - a Midwestern state - will remove barriers to trade and pave the way for businesses to invest, export and create jobs.
Opportunities in areas such as renewable energy, advanced manufacturing and pharmaceuticals will be available to businesses under the agreement, the UK says.
It says the agreement would also streamline procurement processes, enable academics to collaborate more easily, and ensure that professional qualifications were recognized on both sides.
In 2019, the UK was the seventh largest export market for Indiana, which has a gross domestic product (GDP) of about $350bn and a large manufacturing sector.
greement was the ""first of many"" the UK would sign ""as we look to bolster our Â£200bn trading relationship with the US"", Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt said.
Writing for the Conservative Home website, she said agreements with almost half of the 50 US states would follow, including Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas.
Usually trade deals with the US are signed at a national level, between central governments.
But the US government under President Biden has not made a firm commitment to a full free-trade deal with the UK, despite historic ties between the two countries.
Labour's Shadow International Trade Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Conservatives had promised a comprehensive US-UK free-trade agreement by the end of 2022.
""With less than seven months to go it seems that this will be another broken promise from this government,"" he said.
Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat MP and party spokesperson for trade, said the Indiana agreement ""makes a mockery of the government's promise for Global Britain"".
She said Mr Johnson had ""utterly failed to secure the US trade deal he said he would, being left to negotiate with one state at a time with his tail between his legs"".
SNP international trade spokesperson Drew Hendry said the PM had no chance of striking a US-wide deal while he continued his ""reckless games"" over post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland.
He added that ""piecemeal"" agreements with individual US states would do ""little to mitigate the huge damage caused by the Tories' chaotic Brexit"".
uation in Northern Ireland, where a dispute over a post-Brexit trade deal has created a block on forming its devolved government, has been a source on tension between the UK and US.
- known as the protocol - is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.
UK has proposed legislation that would allow ministers to scrap some of the rules governing trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
But some US lawmakers, who must approve trade agreements, have said they would not support one with the UK if its actions jeopardised the peace process in Northern Ireland.
Last week House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was ""deeply concerned"" that the UK was seeking to ""unilaterally discard"" the protocol."	/news/uk-politics-61604784
entertainment	Love Island: Maya Jama to replace Laura Whitmore as host	"Maya Jama has been announced as the new host of ITV2's dating show Love Island.
Bafta-winning show will return to South Africa for a ninth season in 2023, with the English TV personality and ""Love Island fan"" at the helm.
Jama recently co-presented BBC One's Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer, as well as the BBC Three show Glow Up: Britain's Next Make-Up Star.
She will replace Laura Whitmore, who in turn succeeded the late Caroline Flack - the original Love Island anchor.
Whitmore fronted the show and its spin-off series Aftersun from 2020 to 2022, following the death of Flack, but announced in August she was to step down.
Paul Mortimer, ITV's director of reality programming said on Wednesday that finding someone to follow the ""wonderful"" Whitmore ""was never going to be easy"".
""In Maya Jama though, we have another high profile fan of the show who'll be a great addition to the Love Island family,"" he stated.
""Cool, charming and charismatic, I speak for us all when I say Maya will also bring a unique presenting style to the show, as did Laura and, of course, the very much missed Caroline Flack. We're very pleased to have her on board.""
Former Radio 1 DJ Jama began her broadcasting career co-hosting Trending Live on 4Music and Cannonball on ITV, before going on to co-present the Mobo Awards.
28-year-old, who has also appeared as a guest on the aforementioned Aftersun as well as RuPaul's Drag Race UK and The Big Fat Quiz of the Year, shared the news herself in a video posted to her 2.4 million Instagram followers.
""I've always been such a massive Love Island fan and I'm so excited to be hosting one of the nation's favourite shows!"" she said in a separate statement given to the press.
""I can't wait to get into the villa to meet all of the islanders.""
Love Island series eight title was taken by winning couple Ekin-Su Culculoglu and Davide Sanclimenti in Mallorca in August."	/news/entertainment-arts-63230348
politics	Angela Rayner aide Jack McKenna cleared of wrongdoing by Labour	"A senior aide to Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner has been cleared of any wrongdoing following an internal investigation.
Ms Rayner's communications chief Jack McKenna was suspended by the party almost a year ago.
was seen at the time as a sign of rising tensions between Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and his deputy.
Sir Keir had earlier tried but did not succeed in moving Ms Rayner to another role in a reshuffle.
Mr McKenna - who had also been a party official under Jeremy Corbyn - was accused of a data breach.
But he, in turn, complained that news of his suspension had been leaked before he had been told of it - in other words, that his own data had been breached.
Labour officials described the period of his suspension as ""leave"".
Privately, some officials close to the Labour leader were keen for him to go.
While still being paid by the party, he was unable to carry out his duties on behalf of Angela Rayner.
He has now decided to leave his post as her communications director and will seek a new challenge.
In a statement, the Labour Party acknowledged that information about his employment status had wrongly been made public last year.
A spokesman said: 'We unreservedly condemn misleading and unauthorised leaks about Jack to the media. 
""In that context, we wish to make clear that Jack leaves the Labour Party with a clean record and without any disciplinary action against him.'
His work was praised both by Sir Keir Starmer and Ms Rayner, who called him a ""consummate professional"".
It is rare for such statements to be made by the Labour Party following internal investigations or disciplinary processes.
fact that it has done so in this case would suggest the party had been facing the prospect of legal action, and that a settlement - perhaps a substantial settlement - had been reached out of court.
Neither Labour nor Mr McKenna would comment on the legal situation."	/news/uk-politics-63600697

Eight youngsters have been found host families in Ipswich, in a scheme organised by coach Helen Thornton and Badminton England.
It means they can attend sessions at the town's Badminton Performance Centre at sixth form college Suffolk One.
""It's absolutely everything to all the people who are here - it's a huge sport for them,"" said Ms Thornton.
""There are two things they wanted to be - one, was to be safe and two, to be somewhere they could play badminton.
""That was their second requirement over and above school, and having a nice home.""
Yana, 17, and her elder sister, Yuliia, from the central Ukrainian city Dnipro, initially fled to Poland, and have lived with Alex and Jane Gooch since May. 
r family are still in Ukraine, caring for grandparents, and are in daily contact. 
""Our parents are really grateful to our sponsors because their daughters are in a safe place, we have a home, food and great people to live with who care about us,"" said Yana.

""I'm really happy to be playing badminton again because I can't tell you how much I love the sport,"" she added.
""It helps me to think about something else - not the war, the news - I can concentrate on my training.""
Ms Thornton added the integration over the past few weeks has been ""incredible"".
""The kids are so involved and [playing badminton] gives them some sense of normality,"" she said.
""As soon as they walk in the hall they've got a smile on their face, and they work really hard.

business	New Year's Eve parties hit by rail strikes and cost of living	"New Year's Eve celebrations look set to be hit by rail strikes and the cost of living crisis as industry experts say bars and restaurant bookings are down.
One in three reservations were cancelled in December, when the sector lost Â£2.3bn, UK Hospitality said.
re is ""huge"" concern that strikes will further hit New Year bookings and result in job losses in January, the Night Time Industries Association said.
government says it is doing all it can to mitigate the impact of strikes.
Paul Kohler, owner of the CellarDoor a cocktail and cabaret bar in London's West End, was hoping the first New Year celebrations since coronavirus restrictions would go with a bang. 
But he told BBC Breakfast rail strikes were a big factor in party plans fizzling out. 
""New Year bookings are down again, we are hoping it will be good but people are losing faith in the transport system, they are worried about getting home at night,"" he said.
rain services continue to be hit by cancellations and delays as rail workers stage a series of national strikes in a dispute over pay, job security and working conditions.
Kate Nichols, chief executive of industry organisation UK Hospitality told BBC Breakfast losses in December were worse than expected due to rail worker walk outs.
""We know that when the train strikes were announced... you saw cancellation rates as high as 50-60% in the centre of London and 20-30% around the rest of the country directly attributable to those strike days.""
Meanwhile, with the cost of living in the UK near a record high, people are cutting down on going out at the same time that business running costs are going up.
Angela Baker from Bolton, owns Bakers coffee shop, bar and restaurant in Egerton, and Courses by Bakers restaurant at Turton Golf Club.
She said bookings over Christmas were ""quieter than usual"" and her New Year's Eve tickets were 70% to 80% sold.
""I think they're nervous about what's happening next with the cost of living crisis,"" she added.
""We've found Covid is still impacting us,"" said Ms Baker. ""We've had people cancelling over the last few days due to Covid and lots of staff off ill.""
She said while the costs of running her businesses were rising she did not want to have to up prices when her customers were struggling themselves.
Mr Kohler said he paid his staff the Real Living Wage for London of Â£11.95 an hour, which is more than the National Living Wage - known as the minimum wage - of Â£9.50.
Combined with ""costs going up and up"", his ""profits are shrinking"", Mr Kohler said. 
""We don't have any profits at this stage - we are just surviving... hospitality is in real danger at the moment,"" he added.
Many businesses have lost up to 50% of trade during the festive period which they were relying heavily on to see them through early 2023, said Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association.
Mr Kill said the government's delay in announcing any further help on energy bills for businesses had left many facing further uncertainty. 
""We will without doubt now see a huge swathe of businesses and jobs lost in January due to the government's inaction,"" he added.
It comes after the British Beer and Pub Association said 386 pubs closed in England & Wales in 2022, with thousands more looking at altering their opening hours this winter to survive.
going cost of living crisis combined with further strike action means it is ""going to undoubtedly be a very tough first quarter of the year for hospitality"", said Ms Nichols from UK Hospitality.
raditionally, bumper profits in December driven by Christmas celebrations make up for lower takings in January and February, she said.
But this year has seen ""much more profitable sales in December being lost,"" she said. ""That means those businesses are much more vulnerable and fragile.""
Mr Kohler urged ministers to negotiate with rail workers to end strikes and to give more support on energy bills and business rates.
""Hospitality will die unless we get a grip,"" he said.
Ms Baker said: ""I have had a number of friends who have lost or chosen to walk away from the hospitality business post-pandemic, and because of the cost of living.
""I have staff who were landladies who both gave up their pubs and came to work with me,"" she added.
Ms Baker said hospitality businesses like hers relied on busy Christmas and New Year periods to help them weather the quieter winter months ahead.
""With Courses being at a golf club, the season doesn't start again until March so we are expecting a quiet couple of months,"" she said.
""But even with Bakers coffee shop, January is a notoriously tough month because everybody starts the new year with good intentions.""
government said it recognised this was a difficult time for hospitality and night time businesses and said ""we remain firmly on their side"". 
A spokesperson highlighted the Energy Bill Relief Scheme and a Business Rates package they said was worth Â£13.6billion over the next five years.
""We are doing all we can to mitigate the impact of this strike action, but the only way to stop the disruption completely is for union bosses to get back round the table and call off these damaging strikes,"" the spokesperson said."	/news/business-64124916
health	NHS trust apologises as man kept in hospital for more than a year	"A man with physical and mental health problems is ""living"" in a hospital despite being fit to leave, a court has heard.
man, who is in his 30s, has been in hospital for more than a year.
A barrister leading the man's legal team told how he had tried to ""escape"" and broke an arm during the attempt.
Court of Protection heard that he remained in hospital because no ""available alternative accommodation"" had been found. 
Manchester City Council has responsibility for his care, but the NHS trust involved has apologised for ""not yet"" identifying a ""suitable community placement"".
A lawyer representing another health authority told the judge that professionals involved were under pressure because of the ""state"" of the health and social care services.
Mr Justice Hayden, who is overseeing the case, asked why no plan for the man's discharge had been formulated and indicated that he would review the case in the near future.
""This is a case about a young man who has been in [hospital] for over a year,"" barrister Ben McCormack, who is leading the man's legal team, said in a written case outline.
""He is medically fit to be discharged.""
Mr McCormack said the man was ""living"" in hospital and added: ""The real problem is that no available alternative accommodation has yet been sourced.""
He said despite the ""wide range"" of public authorities involved, each of which supported discharge, the man remained in hospital without any ""alternative options actually yet on the table"".
""[He] dislikes being required to live in hospital,"" Mr McCormack told the judge.
""He feels imprisoned. He has tried to escape through the ceiling of the bathroom attached to his ward.
""He hurt himself, he broke his arm.""
Mr McCormack said the man had ""extensive health needs"" which would need to be met outside hospital.
But he added: ""We are not attempting to land a person on the Moon here.""
Mr McCormack said the man had a computer, and a television, and had watched the World Cup Final on Sunday.
""We will deploy any and every resource to try and get this man out of hospital,"" Vikram Sachdeva KC, who represented one of the health authorities involved, told the judge.
""We know the state that the health service and social care services are in.
""It is cold comfort to the individual, but the professionals do have that pressure.""
Barrister Alexis Hearnden, who represented the NHS trust involved, told the judge in a written case outline: ""The trust offers an apology to the court and [the man] that it has not yet identified a suitable community placement.""
She said ""progress"" had been made recently.
""[His] physical health has at times been extremely precarious,"" she said.
""During the currency of this hospital admission, his health has also fluctuated and a stroke in July 2022 set back plans to discharge [him] from hospital.""

health	RSV: Children's clinic extends hours to cut hospital admissions	"A clinic which treats children and babies with respiratory issues has extended its hours to try and ease pressure on hospital admissions.
York's Children's Ambulatory Treatment (CAT) Hub will now open five days a week, up from two.
rincipal cause for child hospital stays is winter bug Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).
Nationally, almost 30,000 hospital admissions come as a result of the virus each year.
Dr Daniel Kimberling said the hub, which treats under 12s with all respiratory illnesses, was ramping up operations after seeing a rise in cases of children attending hospital.
""We want to be ready for winter,"" the medical director added.
Sources: UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), NHS, House of Lords Library
Dr Brown said the service, which includes experienced children's nurses working alongside a GP, was able to spend more time with children and their parents.
""In a GP surgery you might have 15 minutes,"" she said.
""You've not got the time to sit down with parents and explore all of their worries and provide that education about what they can do at home.""
Children are referred to the clinic by GPs or other health professionals and are monitored for two hours, enabling decisions to be made about what care or treatment is needed.
Libby, who had taken her daughter to the clinic, said it was much easier to access and be reassured about her daughter's health than go to hospital.
""We'd normally have to go to A&E and spend about six hours to get the same treatment, just for one tiny bit of medication.""
UK's health regulator recently approved a new treatment for RSV.
gle antibody shot helps stop infants getting chest infections, such as pneumonia, for about six months.
A large study has now begun to find out whether nirsevimab should be offered to all babies in the UK.
Other treatments for RSV already exist and trials of a vaccine have also shown promise.

business	Low-deposit mortgage scheme extended for a year	"A mortgage guarantee scheme to help people get on the property ladder is to be extended by a year.
government said the programme, which was due to close at the end of December, would help buyers ""navigate difficult times"".
It was originally designed to encourage lenders to give home loans to people offering a 5% deposit - a product that was far less available during Covid.
Some lenders still play it safe as buyers face the rising cost of living.
Chief Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""For hard-working families facing today's challenging economic conditions, it is right that we continue to help them secure their first home or move into their dream house.
""Extending this scheme means thousands more have the chance to benefit, and supports the market as we navigate through these difficult times.""
mortgage scheme has a Â£600,000 limit, and is primarily used to help first-time buyers.
95% loan-to-value mortgages are often seen as riskier by banks as they are more vulnerable to falling property prices, when there is a risk that people hold more debt than their home is worth.
Under the scheme, the government takes on some of the risk and compensates the lender for some of the loan if the property is repossessed.
It began in April last year, and the government said it had helped more than 24,000 households.
Some brokers have suggested the scheme had done its job by bringing more low-deposit mortgages onto the market, but others suggested only a small number of lenders had used the scheme.
Many mortgage providers generally only lend to those with a regular income, irrespective of any government incentive, and still carry out affordability checks.
Unemployment levels are expected to rise and the UK housing market is expected to slow.

From mid-May, people will be able to use office space created in the chain's New Malden store in London.
A flexible office area will use space in-store, with desks, co-working areas and a meeting room provided.
move highlights the continued move away from traditional office set-ups since the pandemic. 
IWG said that the trial with Tesco was reflective of ""really strong demand"" from office workers to have suburban alternatives close to home, as opposed to commuting into city centres.
""People don't want to spend hours commuting every day and instead want to live and work in their local communities,"" said Mark Dixon, founder and chief executive of IWG. 
Research from the company suggests that 72% of workers would prefer to work flexibly. 
rtnership comes as supermarkets are increasingly looking for new ways to make money from their physical stores, with many shoppers having switched to online deliveries during the Covid pandemic. 
mic and lockdowns also caused a huge shift in people's working patterns and while restrictions have eased, the latest figures suggest that the shift to flexible working is here to stay.
A survey from the Chartered Institute of Management found more than 80% of firms had now adopted hybrid-working since the end of the pandemic. 
Louise Goodland, head of strategic partnerships for Tesco, said the supermarket was always looking to ""serve customers and communities better"" and it would be interested to see the response to the trial."	/news/business-61423168
technology	Elon Musk says Twitter blue tick to be revamped	"New Twitter owner Elon Musk has said the process of gaining a prestigious ""blue tick"" will be revised, amid reports the firm could start charging $20 (Â£17) per month to be verified.
Mr Musk tweeted the verification process was being revamped, days after taking over the social media giant.
A blue tick is currently free and a way of signalling an account is authentic.
Mr Musk completed his $44bn (Â£37.9bn) takeover on Friday, and has renamed himself as Chief Twit on Twitter.
During months of legal wrangling leading up to the acquisition, the billionaire repeatedly expressed concerns about the verification process, and the number of spam and bot accounts he believes litter the site.
Mr Musk's tweet, on Sunday, did not give any more details about what exactly might change.
But according to tech website The Verge, which cited internal correspondence, Twitter now wants to charge people $19.99 per month to keep their blue tick verification status.
It says the plan involves quadrupling the price for Twitter Blue - the company's subscription service - and making verification one of its features.
Verified users would be given 90 days to subscribe or face losing their blue tick, it reports.
Employees were told of the project on Sunday and have been told they need to launch the scheme by 7 November or risk losing their jobs, it added.
witter Blue was launched last summer, and gives subscribers access to various premium features including the option to undo a tweet.
It is currently optional and costs $4.99 per month.
While there has been no official confirmation of the plan, on Monday Mr Musk appeared to acknowledge the speculation in a new tweet which said: ""On no, all our diabolical plans have been revealed!!""
In a separate development, Mr Musk has denied a New York Times report that he plans to lay off Twitter workers before the start of next month to avoid having to make payouts.
It follows his buyout last week which saw the exit of the firm's top bosses - including its chief executive, chairman and finance chief.
At the weekend, The New York Times reported that Mr Musk had ordered major job cuts across Twitter's workforce.
wspaper said the layoffs would take place before 1 November, when workers were due to receive grants of shares in the company as a major part of their pay deals.
But replying to a Twitter user asking about the report, he said: ""This is false.""
keover has prompted discussion among Twitter users over what the platform will look like under Mr Musk's ownership.
Some have voiced concerns that more lenient free speech policies would mean people banned for hate speech or disinformation may be allowed back to the platform. 
Last week Mr Musk said that he doesn't want the platform to become an echo chamber for hate and division. ""Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hell-scape, where anything can be said with no consequences!"" he tweeted.
However after denying the New York Times job cuts report, Mr Musk tweeted a screen shot of a New York Times headline about him posting a link to a ""site known to publish false news"".
New York Times headline referred to a reply Mr Musk had posted, and then deleted, at the weekend to a tweet by former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
His reply contained a link to a conspiracy theory about an assault on Paul Pelosi, husband of US House speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Mr Musk also started a Twitter poll asking his more than 112m followers whether he should bring back the short-video app Vine.
rvice that allowed users to share six-second-long looping clips was bought by Twitter in 2012.
It gained more than 200m active users by the end of 2015 before being shelved by the social media platform.
Mr Musk has previously run polls on whether or not he should sell 10% of his stake in the electric car maker Tesla and if Twitter should have an edit button.

He was known for catchphrases such as ""Ding dong"" - a reference to the name of his character Jack Bell in 1959's Carry on Nurse - ""I say"" and ""Well, hello"", which he delivered with suggestive intonation.
While he only starred in four of the 31 Carry On films, the actor said his famous catchphrases followed him for the rest of his career.
His death - which comes two years after Barbara Windsor's - leaves Jim Dale, 86, as the last surviving regular from the Carry On films.
Coronation Street actor Tony Maudsley, who worked with Phillips, was among those paying tribute, tweeting: ""RIP Leslie Phillips. Working with him was a joy. And yes he did say DING DONG (because I asked him to).""
Actor and comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar shared a video of the ""wonderful"" Phillips on his own BBC show, The Kumars at No 42, in which the late star recalled how he once found himself stuck in the London Underground surrounded by members of the public demanding he do his catchphrases.
Bhaskar recalled him as ""a truly warm, funny and gentle man"".
rainspotting writer Irvine Welsh posted his own tribute to Phillips, who he exchanged messages with online, saying he ""always liked his pater"".
Broadcaster Piers Morgan said it was ""sad news"", describing Phillips as a ""wonderful character and superb comedy actor"".
Author Melanie Blake added: ""Another legend gone, thanks for the entertainment old chap.""
Although he became known for his plummy accent and exaggerated portrayals of the English upper-class, Phillips was born in Tottenham, north London, speaking estuary English.
He attended Italia Conti Stage School before serving as a lieutenant in the Durham Light Infantry during World War Two - between 1942 and 1945, when he was invalided out.
1930s had marked his first film appearances, but it was later in his career, in 1959 and 1960, when he starred in Carry On Nurse, Carry On Teacher and Carry On Constable.
He became well known for his appearances in the Doctor film franchise - succeeding Dirk Bogarde in films like 1960's Doctor in Love - as well as in a series of fast-moving comedies that teamed him with Scots comedian and impressionist Stanley Baxter.
He also appeared in Brothers In Law, The Smallest Show On Earth and The Man Who Liked Funerals.
For 17 years he appeared alongside Ronnie Barker and Jon Pertwee on hit BBC radio show The Navy Lark.
He also took on dramatic roles, including a Bafta-nominated appearance opposite Peter O'Toole in 2006's Venus.
A long-term fan of Tottenham Hotspur, Phillips appeared on the pitch as part of the half-time entertainment during the team's home match against Swansea City in 2012.
Phillips was made an OBE in the 1998 Birthday Honours list and was promoted to CBE in the 2008 New Year Honours.

politics	Government to share energy-saving tips in TV ads	"UK government will promote energy-saving tips in adverts on TV and at bus stops as part of an information campaign due to be launched this week.
mpaign will feature ads with the strapline ""It All Adds Up"" and a new website with advice such as turning down boilers.
Business Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to be involved in messaging to help households reduce energy use.
government estimates the campaign will cost taxpayers about Â£18m.
w website is expected to go live on Saturday before adverts on TV, radio and on the sides of buses appear after Christmas.
A government source said they were keen to get Mr Shapps out doing interviews and possibly recording videos for promotion on social media.
urce said the campaign will be pushed out on government social media channels and ""we'll try to get energy-saving networks such as Which? and energy companies to help get it to as wide an audience as possible"".
One of the main focuses will be encouraging households to lower their boiler-flow temperature to 60C in order to save an estimated Â£100 a year.
Other advice will include turning off appliances at the plug when they are not in use, and draught-proofing windows and doors by putting blankets under them.
mpaign, designed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), is part of the government's push to curb energy use during the cost-of-living crisis.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's approach has differed to that of his predecessor, Liz Truss, who was reported to have been ""ideologically opposed"" to an energy-saving a campaign.
But her government changed tack and said it was considering how to expand the existing Help for Households website.
One government source said the campaign being launched this weekend was an extension of that website.
Help for Households website includes actions such as turning down radiators not in use to save an estimated Â£70 per year.
government has capped the amount per unit of energy suppliers can charge consumers so that a typical bill remains at Â£2,500 a year until the end of March.
But help with energy costs will be less generous from April, with bills for a typical household going up to Â£3,000.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has described cutting energy use as a ""national mission"" to stop the UK being ""blackmailed"" by the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
war in Ukraine has tightened supplies of gas, which the UK is heavily reliant on for heating and powering its homes and businesses.
Mr Hunt said ""in the end everyone is going to have to take responsibility for their energy bills"" and consider how to cut their consumption."	/news/uk-politics-63971909
technology	Heatwave: Why your phone overheats and how to prevent it	"fan is on, you've just finished your 10th iced coffee and are ready to scroll through your phone.
But your device is either slow, too hot or has a drained battery. Sound familiar?
Current record-breaking temperatures are not just affecting people's bodies, but also their electronics.
But, unlike humans, phones can't sweat - which is good for those who hold their phones but not great for our handsets.
So why do our electronics struggle in the heat and what can we do about it?
Much like how we struggle to operate at the same speed in intense heat, it can be something similar for the phone's processor - a chip inside that's responsible for its main functions.
""The internal things that actually make it all work, unfortunately, themselves generate heat in the way they work,"" says Dr Roz Wyatt-Millington, a senior lecturer in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Leeds Beckett University.
""And as the device gets hotter for phones, the processor tries to stop itself overheating, and it ends up slowing everything down as a result,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.
She says electronics are generally designed to work up to 35 degrees Celsius. 
""Batteries store energy and are designed to work at certain temperatures. The hotter they get, the harder they have to work and the more energy they use,"" says Dr Roz.
Which means the battery life gets drained more quickly, especially as it's harder to cool.
""They also use energy to monitor their own state, and basically have to do more work.""
Dr Roz adds we often turn up screen brightness when outside in the sunshine, which can also have an impact.
If you've noticed a slight change in your screen, the heat might have had an impact.
""If it's an older phone, if there's a slight defect in it, the heat will magnify it,"" says Dr Roz.
She adds that screen protectors can often hold more heat inside, which isn't good in hot conditions. 
Don't stick it on charge
""If it's really hot, when you are charging your battery, you are generating heat. When your device has been on charge, it ends up being hotter,"" Dr Roz says.
Position it smartly
""Keeping it out of direct sunlight helps. Don't leave it in your car, keep in the shade as much as possible. Put it in front of a fan if you can.""
Keep it light
utside of the phone. Take it out of a case and turn off all the functions you do not need.
""If you're not using the GPS, if you're not using stuff, turn it off. Because the less stuff you actually use, the less energy you're going to use, the less heat it's going to generate,"" she says.
Low power mode
wer you use, the better off your phone will be.
""Sometimes just simply, if your phone's really struggling, turn it off for a few minutes, just let it all cool down, and then turn it back on again.""
But do not use a fridge or freezer...
""Don't stick it in a bag of ice, because that doesn't help it."" 
Rapid temperature changes can be really bad for phones, and the ice can lead to water becoming trapped in it.
Dr Roz adds phones have overheat mechanisms built into them to stop them from ""destroying themselves, which can happen in really bad heat"".

entertainment	The birth pangs of the Grand Theft Auto franchise	"Grand Theft Auto franchise has been a phenomenal success since it was first launched exactly 25 years ago, making billions of dollars for its American owner Take-Two Interactive.
So it may come as a surprise to learn that its creators, Dundee-based DMA Design, were far from confident about GTA's prospects as they struggled with creative and technical problems during its development in the 1990s.
Colin Macdonald, who joined DMA a few months before the launch of the action-adventure video game in 1997, explains: ""In mid-development, there was an informal staff survey on which of the seven titles they were working on would be the most successful and least successful. 
""The one voted most likely not to succeed was Grand Theft Auto.
""That's because, mid-development, the direction of the game wasn't clear. It was also quite buggy - you couldn't play it for more than a couple of minutes without it crashing, so certainly at grassroots level there wasn't a lot of confidence in it."" 
Colin, who was to become the producer of GTA 2 and later Channel 4's first games commissioning editor, says the atmosphere at DMA was ""quite relaxed"" by the time he joined.
""GTA went through a lot of different iterations and was quite a troubled development, and wasn't really regarded well for most of the time it was in production.
""By the time I joined it was pretty much done and the team was actually quite happy because they had kind of got shot of it.
""They were looking forward to sitting back, planning a sequel properly, redoing the things that they weren't happy with, and just looking forward to getting stuck into iterating on it and seeing where else they could take it.""
Fans of GTA may also be surprised to learn that the franchise actually stemmed from a technology experiment - with a dinosaur as its central character.
Colin explains: ""One of the original founding programmers at DMA, Mike Dailly, was basically doing a tech experiment as a way of showing how buildings could look in 3D from top down with a little bit of perspective.
""So he basically came up with a dinosaur game. You had this city that moved around in some form of 3D, but you were a dinosaur roaming around and destroying the buildings. That was what Grand Theft Auto started as.
""He then added in little cars driving around, just to bring the city to life. 
""Someone had the bright idea to see what it would be like driving one of the cars rather than controlling the dinosaur and suddenly it changed into a car game, rather than a dinosaur game. 
""It was called Race 'n' Chase for a good while. And then someone realised, 'oh, actually we'll try letting the player get out of the car and run around and jump in and out of other cars'. 
""It was really only at that point it morphed into Grand Theft Auto."" 
Overhauling the original idea brought its own problems, according to Colin.
""When you are changing a game so fundamentally like that, all sorts of problems get introduced.
""You have developed code that is no longer doing what it was originally intended to do. So there's all sorts of problems - the game gets very buggy and crashes a lot, and the team are feeling like the whole process is completely changing and they are not doing what they originally set out to do. 
""But actually, this process of evolving and iterating is what made it feel so dynamic. 
""So although it was a very frustrating process for the team, it meant they could see what really worked, iterate on it and give the game a new direction.
""They also had time to polish it, so they started doing things like adding skid marks and shadows and nice sound effects and the radio stations - all of those things that really brought the world to life.""
Colin says that although GTA only came together in its final six months of development, there were signs that it could connect with a wide audience.
""The team were playing it in their own lunchtimes, which is always a rare thing. 
""After you spend a couple of years developing something, you are usually sick to the back teeth of seeing it - the last thing you want to do is see it again in your spare time."" 
Colin says the sequel he produced involved making technical changes to make the game more ""structurally sound"" and moving the game from being set in the contemporary world. 
""We wanted to make it feel a little bit more futuristic. That gave us more creative licence with the vehicles, with the weapons, with the types of environments you would see. 
""In hindsight, that probably hasn't resonated with audiences as well as the contemporary vehicles and cities. Most of the Grand Theft Auto games have gone back to being set more or less in the present day.""
Colin adds that despite the franchise's birth pangs, there was a sense within the original team that they were on to something.
""We knew we had something special - the fact that the team were playing it in their own time is a really strong indicator of that - but there are countless games that come out every year that are creatively and technically brilliant but just don't sell particularly well, for whatever reason. 
""Most people don't hear about them - they are not quite capturing the zeitgeist of the moment - and Grand Theft Auto could easily have been another one of those.
""It's been quite a surprise to see it still do so well a quarter of a century later.""

entertainment	Gary Lineker tweet broke impartiality rules, says BBC complaints unit	"Gary Lineker broke BBC impartiality rules in a tweet about the Conservative Party, the corporation has ruled.
In February, the Match of the Day host posted a story about then-Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urging a boycott of the Champions League final in Russia.
He added: ""And her party will hand back their donations from Russian donors?""
BBC's Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) has upheld a complaint and said Lineker's post ""did not meet the BBC's editorial standards on impartiality"".
former England striker declined to comment on the decision.
ECU said Lineker was ""one of the BBC's highest profile stars"" and, although not required to uphold the same high standards of impartiality as the broadcaster's journalists, does have an ""additional responsibility"" because of his profile.
""We expect these individuals to avoid taking sides on party political issues or political controversies and to take care when addressing public policy matters,"" the ruling said.
It explained that Lineker had pointed out that the tweet was prompted by an article about football, his primary area of expertise, and the board accepted it was intended as a comment on the sport rather than politics.
BBC Sport managers also pointed out that he framed his tweet in the form of a question, rather than a statement of opinion on a politically controversial matter.
However, the ECU concluded that the post was intended to highlight a ""perceived inconsistency in the Conservative Party's approach, at a time when relations between the UK and Russia were the subject of significant public debate"".
Lineker's tweet came as Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, and just before European footballing body Uefa moved the Champions League final from St Petersburg to Paris as a result.
ECU said its ruling had been discussed with Lineker and BBC Sport managers. "	/news/entertainment-arts-63248314
politics	Rishi Sunak: New PM a friend to Wales - top Welsh Tory	"""Hopefully it just gets better,"" one woman said in response to the news Rishi Sunak will be the UK's next prime minister
A senior Welsh Conservative has described the next Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as a ""friend of Wales"", who ""understands the challenges we face"".
He will take office in coming days, and Andrew RT Davies, the Tories' Senedd leader, urged the party's MPs to unite.
But the main Welsh opposition parties said he has ""no mandate"" and repeated their calls for a general election.
Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford urged Mr Sunak to ""work constructively"" with him in ""these difficult times"".
weeting in the moments after the appointment was confirmed, Mr Davies said: ""I know that colleagues in Westminster will realise the real need to come together to deliver for the people of Wales and the United Kingdom. 
""As a friend of Wales, Rishi understands the challenges we face, with high energy bills, high inflation, and household budgets being stretched to breaking point.
""I look forward to working with him to tackle those challenges.""
Mr Davies added that it was important to celebrate the UK's first British Asian and Hindu prime minister.
Former Conservative Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said the announcement ""ends the political uncertainty"".
Businesses and residents in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, reacted to the new occupant of 10 Downing Street.
Mary Caldwell, from The Deli on the Hill, said: ""I feel he is solid and he will help us through.
""We are very concerned - there's no question the high street is quieter. The higher luxury areas are suffering. 
""The small business is the backbone of Britain. We employ, they have money to spend.""
Omer Akca, owner of Gino's Tailoring, was hoping for the return of Boris Johnson as prime minister, but echoed Ms Caldwell's hope for business support.
He said: ""Maybe [Rishi Sunak] can help, I hope he's ok. Business is quiet, everywhere quiet.""
Hayley Morgan, owner of The Twisted Tree gift shop, added: ""I just want somebody to address the key issues: cost of living, energy.
""I don't want the deterioration of the high street. Here in Prestatyn we have worked hard to establish [it].""
However, Mike Hall, visiting Wales from Birmingham is not convinced after watching Mr Sunak's performance as chancellor.
He said: ""I wish him the best of luck getting everything straight, but I feel it's him giving stuff away that got us into this in the first place.""
Ethan Harvey, a Conservative Party member from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, told BBC Radio Wales Drive that he had voted for Liz Truss in the last leadership contest.
He said: ""She came in at a difficult time. It's about helping people now, through the winter, help them pay their bills. It's really important we do that, and party comes second.""
Edward Dawson, chair of Merthyr Tydfil Conservatives and regional chair for south east Wales, added: ""People who do need help, in Wales and elsewhere, cannot be left behind. 
""I've talked to Rishi. He understands that, he knows this is a key part of his job in the short term. Not that there won't be difficulties, and there will be upsets along the way.""
Labour shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said: ""No-one voted for this. It's time for a general election.""  
While First Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted his congratulations in Welsh to Mr Sunak, and added: ""The UK desperately needs a period of stability and cooperation to focus on the many challenges we face.
""I hope we're able to work constructively together to support people through these difficult times in a way that your predecessors didn't allow.""
Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said: ""The anti-democratic nature of the Westminster system has been laid bare for all to see. Rishi Sunak has no mandate, no legitimacy. Democracy demands a general election.
""Rishi Sunak's coronation may soothe the financial markets in the short term, but the Tory party is still riven with factions who will be jostling for the upper hand at critical votes.""
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said: ""The problem is clearly not any single prime minister or minister, but the Conservative Party as an institution which continues to put its own wellbeing above that of the country's and is so internally divided it cannot hope to produce a well-functioning government.
""Rishi Sunak showed time and time again in his role as chancellor that he was out of touch with the struggles ordinary people faced, whether it's paying their heating bills or being able to access key public services. 
""The public has lost trust in the Conservatives and Sunak does not have a mandate from the people, we need a general election now to get us out of this perpetual chaos and give the country fresh hope.""
Mr Sunak will succeed Liz Truss seven weeks after she defeated him in the previous Tory contest, following her resignation just 45 days into her tumultuous premiership last week.
x-chancellor gained the support of more than half of Tory MPs, with Penny Mordaunt struggling to reach the 100 MP threshold.  
He will become the UK's first British Asian PM and, at the age of 42, the youngest in more than a century. 
Ms Mordaunt, who dropped out of the Tory leadership race in the final minutes before nominations closed, said Mr Sunak has her ""full support"". "	/news/uk-wales-63377294

Mr Streeting went on to say that the government should be ""biting the hand"" off unions offering to hold talks over NHS pay rises. 
He said it was up to the government to cancel the planned strikes, but in not doing so it was a ""real lack of responsibility and betrayal of patients.

technology	What is behind the big tech companies' job cuts?	"first sign of job cuts at Amazon came from LinkedIn posts from laid-off employees.
, Amazon's devices boss, Dave Limp, announced: ""It pains me... We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices & services org"".
Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are ""seeking new opportunities"".
Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.
Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.
As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.
Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.
Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.
""I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,"" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.
""Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.""
Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers. 
And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.
In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.
""It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,"" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. ""No-one's immune.""
Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was ""still hiring"", but only on a ""deliberate basis."" 
Amazon attributed its job cuts to an ""unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment"" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.
""As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,"" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. 
""As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.""
Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.
In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.
Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.
Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.
Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.
He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an ""extreme"" work ethic is promised.
According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a ""hardcore"" culture of ""long hours at high intensity"" or leave. 
Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.
Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.
""Some companies have had to face harsh realities,"" he said.
Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.
""The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,"" he said.
But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.
Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.
And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.
As veteran Silicon Valley watcher Mike Malone recently told the BBC: ""I won't write the Valley off yet. I still have a lot of hope."""	/news/technology-63635821
technology	UK firm takes on Apple iPhone 14 and Elon Musk with satellite phone	"A British smartphone maker hopes to steal a march on Apple and Tesla boss Elon Musk with a new satellite-connected handset, the BBC has learned.
If there is no wi-fi or mobile network signal, the idea is the Bullitt phone will automatically link to one of two global satellite networks.
re is speculation that Apple's forthcoming iPhone 14 could have emergency satellite connectivity.
Mr Musk is also working on a satellite phone service with T-Mobile.  
However, last month he said plans were hampered by ""regulatory approval"" of satellite launches and added that the service would be unlikely to become available before the end of 2023.
Bullitt's service is due to launch in February 2023 and will initially enable users to send and receive text messages only. 
recipient will receive the message in the form of an SMS and can reply if they download Bullitt's app. It is free to use for them - but the Bullitt phone owner will have to pay a monthly subscription for the service. 
Reading-based firm declined to say how much it would cost but said it would be available in tiers, on a par with existing mobile tariffs and payable on top of a standard network contract. It has yet to release images of the device.
And while Apple's service is rumoured to be for emergency use only in North America, Bullitt claims its phone will automatically switch to satellite in the absence of any other signal worldwide.
""What we've got is a smartphone launching in February that will be capable of two-way messaging, via satellite, with global coverage,"" said Bullitt co-founder Richard Wharton.
""I'm hoping that we've managed to jump ahead."" 
Mr Musk says that currently phones using his platform could have to wait up to 30 minutes to connect with a satellite. However, Mr Wharton said he believed that thanks to deals with two global satellite networks - which he declined to name - the wait would not be more than a few seconds.
requires a bespoke chipset that has been developed over the last 18 months with an Asian manufacturer, he said. The battery drain would be minimised by the phone only seeking satellites in the absence of other signals, he added.
So-called ""not-spots"", where there is poor or no mobile coverage, exist all over the world, particularly in rural areas. 
""We want to work with [network operators] because there are challenges with providing cellular coverage to 100% geography of a country, so what we are offering is that infill, where there are coverage black spots,"" said Mr Wharton.
Satellite phones have traditionally been expensive with limited functionality, and satellite reception can also be disrupted by weather conditions.
""Satellite remains the next and last frontier in connectivity,"" said Paolo Pescatore, tech analyst at PP Foresight.
""It is encouraging to see providers starting to get serious about using satellite for the last mile. Ultimately reliable and robust connectivity is still highly sought-after among all users.""

sports	Eilish McColgan column: 'Why is menstruation still a taboo subject?'	"Considering almost half the population menstruate every month, it seems odd to me that it's still such a taboo subject in 2022. 
Even more so within the context of sport. As a professional athlete, performing is our number one task. But what if our own bodies are working against us on that particular day?
Dina Asher-Smith talked about it after pulling out of the European Championships 100m with cramps on Tuesday, and I know first-hand how much periods can affect performance. 
Before Oslo earlier this season, I'd only ever dropped out of two competitions. The dreaded DNF. And on both occasions, periods were the perpetrator. 
way to describe it is that my legs feel like they have been replaced with concrete blocks. And that a screwdriver is carving out the Taj Mahal around my ovaries. 
Some months, it's manageable. Other months, it's unbearable. There's no telling which Eilish you're going to get on the day. To try and run, or at least perform to the best of my ability, is an almost impossible task. 
And after a bad result, I get eaten alive on social media by armchair critics, giving their theories as to why I'm the failureâ¦ 
As a youngster, I used to suffer excruciating cramps every month to the point where my body would go into a fever and start vomiting. 
Flashing from hot-to-cold, I would have a full day in bed feeling like death, before waking up the following morning as if nothing had happened. 
I went to the doctors and they prescribed the pill. It made me feel rotten. I was crying almost every day and snapping at the smallest of arguments. 
Considering I was rarely emotional, it felt like a large swing in personality and I didn't like the way I felt, or the person the hormones were manipulating me to be. I quickly stopped the medication. 
For the next decade, I got on with it as best I could. As I got older, the vomiting stopped and my symptoms eased. Life was manageable but as I transitioned into elite athletics, the struggle became more evident as it translated into performances. 
In 2019, while at a meet in California, I posted on Instagram about how my periods had caused me to DNF. I couldn't believe the overwhelmingly positive response from other women. Many felt they were alone with this issue. And as it wasn't something Olympic athletes spoke about, most assumed it didn't affect us. 
I remember the race so vividly because I had paid a lot of money to attend - international flights, accommodation and a race entry. It all added up to a pretty sum. But it would all be worth it to get a shot at qualifying for the upcoming World Championships. 
My period was a little delayed because of the long-haul travel (another factor female athletes need to consider). So of course, it decided to announce its timely arrival while I was warming up for the race. 
I took a load of Ibuprofen to settle my stomach cramps and shuffled over to the start line. I felt like Shamu the whale and dropped out after just five laps of a 25-lap race. I remember thinking, 'what a waste of money' and really beating myself up. 
qualifying races in the United States are notoriously late in the evening. Too late for any restaurants to be open. But we trekked a couple of miles to the nearest drive-through McDonalds. We literally said a prayer as we arrived but reality came knocking when they wouldn't serve us without a car. 
I sat in the car park, at stupid o'clock in the morning, and cried. Cried because we didn't have a car, and because they wouldn't serve us a Big Mac. 
Luckily, on our way home we found a 24-hr grocery store. I bought a family-size cake and it was worth every cent of the $8.99 it cost me. 
It still fascinates me that a large majority of women struggle with their menstrual cycles every month, and yet no one seems to have the answers. Even now, the research in regards to sport, especially, is sparse. 
I presume it would be addressed in far more detail if it affected men - especially our top male athletes. Can you imagine how many Premier League footballers would be left on the bench? Curled up into a wee ball, just waiting for the full-time whistle to be blown so they can go home and sleep.
Periods can also be an added injury risk. Muscle and tendon injuries are far greater and it's the reason why many of women's teams in sports such as hockey and football are now accommodating their athletes' cycles within their training programmes. 
I know some sprinters, such as Dina, completely avoid gym work because of it. In an event where power is king, I imagine it's hugely frustrating having to adapt your schedule. Every. Single. Month. But that's the reality. 
A few years ago, I made the mistake of training too hard during a certain phase of my cycle and ended up tearing my hamstring. It was a lesson I learned the hard way, but I hope the younger generation can learn from it.
In 2019, when I brought up how frustrating it is for periods to coincide with a major competition, a man replied on Twitter. His solution was to not bother competing when it's my time of the month and to just schedule another race. 
As if I could simply call up the Olympic Games and ask them to move my event to the following week to fit my cycle. The mind boggles sometimesâ¦ but it also just shows me the complete lack of awareness that some people have. 
uldn't be an embarrassing topic. Coaches, physiotherapists, teachers, parents, partners and friends - they all play a role in making this an open dialogue. We need to feel comfortable having this discussion. 
A few professional athletes I've spoken to have stopped taking the hormonal pill after several years. They want to feel more in control of their bodies and to track their natural cycle. 
If an individual is over-training or under-fuelling, the menstrual cycle is often the first thing to disappear. At least by taking a period, as much as I hate it, it gives some reassurance that the body is healthy and in a good energy balance. 
f the most important messages I want to get across to younger athletes. 
One of the best things I ever did was open up the conversation - not only between other professional athletes but also online, to a larger community of women. Sharing experiences, listening to others and taking advice. 
re is still a lot of trial and error in finding what works for each individual, but I personally feel much more educated on the subject than ever before. 
I still don't have all the answers I need, but I'll continue to keep that conversation open for the next generation of young female athletes, in the hope that one day we do. "	/sport/athletics/61752427

politics	More Holyrood taxes come at a cost	"re are benefits from putting up taxes, but none of them cost-free. On the upside, John Swinney is raising Â£129m next year, mainly from higher earners. 
Also on the upside, the Scottish Parliament is moving beyond the experimental phase of fiddling with its new tax powers. Budget day used to be all about how to spend money. This year's budget is at least as much about how to secure the tax revenue necessary.
makes for a more balanced and mature politics than we used to see.
Finding another Â£129m is not that much in a budget of Â£45bn, and a long way behind the Â£918m set to be raised from the effects of inflation. But the way it is funded adds to a developing trend of divergence from the UK's income tax regime.
Scottish Fiscal Commission tells us that the tax take next year is set to be Â£1bn more than it would have been without devolution of income tax. That is on course to rise above Â£1.5bn within five years.
A lot of the increase comes from freezing thresholds for different rates of tax. While earners seek pay increases to meet at least some of their additional costs due to inflation, the tax on that delivers more money into the Scottish government kitty. And as more people move into the higher tax bands, a lot more revenue is raised. That is known as fiscal drag or a stealth tax.
ke a look at individual earner level: for those earning above Â£43,662, each additional pound earned has 42p deducted in Scotland. In the rest of the UK, that deduction is 20p, and so it continues up to Â£50,270 where the marginal tax rate rises to 40p. 
Also, over that tranche of earnings, National Insurance Contributions, which are linked to rest-of-the-UK thresholds, continue to be deducted at 12p in the pound, before falling to 2p. So the combined deduction from each pound earned at that level in Scotland is 54p, and 32p elsewhere.
So if your earnings are at that higher rate threshold just below Â£44,000, you are Â£158 worse off in tax take in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK. If your pay goes up to Â£50,000, that gap with Westminster will have gone up to Â£1,558.  For a GP on Â£100,000 a year, the Scottish income tax bill tops Â£30,000, and is Â£2,606 more than it would be for the same earnings in England or Wales.
How many are caught in that wider net of higher tax? The SFC estimates a rise from 11.6% of taxpayers in 2016 to 18.4% next year - nearly one in five. That is no longer an earnings elite.
Looked at another way, by only slightly increasing the threshold for higher rate tax in Scotland since 2016, there has been a 23% growth in the numbers paying it, while raising the threshold in the rest of the UK has led to a drop of 10%.
It goes on to say that the newly announced change in policy would raise an extra Â£128m, but only if no-one changed their tax arrangements to avoid it - for instance, by taking income as dividends, which are taxed by the UK Treasury. Once ""behavioural effects"" kick in, then SFC estimates revenue falls from Â£128m to Â£92m.
re's a more pronounced effect for those earning above Â£125,000. They face a move from 41p in each extra pound to 47p. The SFC says the change of threshold should bring in Â£33m if no-one's tax affairs were changed. But once they are, that revenue falls to only Â£8m.
Raising the tax paid by these highest earners would raise Â£33m next year, but it's forecast to bring in only Â£3m.
At the basic level of tax, the effect of fiscal drag is much lower. As people move past its Â£14,332 lower threshold, the amount of tax paid is expected to rise Â£20m.  There will be a smaller behavioural change, some of it from people working fewer hours, and the forecast is down only Â£1m to Â£19m.
Divergence should come as no surprise.  However the income tax powers were used after being devolved, the point was to use them differently, or perhaps to make a positive choice to leave them unchanged.
In the five years since income tax was devolved, Scottish government ministers began by re-shaping income tax into five strands instead of three, one of which means that the lower paid people are Â£20 better off in Scotland than they would be in the rest of the UK. That helps make a political point, but makes little difference to public finances.
majority remain no worse off than they would be south of the border on the same pay, but the changes were calibrated to ensure that above-average full time earnings in Scotland come with higher tax bills. In 2023-24, the point at which earners in Scotland start to pay more tax than the person earning the same salary elsewhere is Â£27,850. 
rogressive, in that the higher burden falls on those who are best equipped to pay. And it helps pay for more generous public services.  
At least in the free provision of student tuition, dental and eye checks, and more generous long-term care packages, there are obvious pay-backs from paying higher tax. 
An uplift in the quality of service is more debatable, as Scotland has long had more inputs per head into schools and the health service.
What is changing fastest in the Scottish budget is the amount going into social security benefits. These are being gradually devolved. Cold weather payments are the latest to move to Holyrood, meaning a Â£50 flat fee per winter, rather than qualifying through temperature drops over a sustained period.
xpected to cost more than twice as much as it did before. With the intention of prioritising dignity and fairness in allocating welfare payments, and with entirely new benefits being created, such as the Scottish Child Payment, it is a more generous system. 
reasury provides Holyrood with the funds that would have been allocated to Scots if none of this budget were devolved.
SFC reckons that the Scottish government is having to raid other budgets this year for Â£400m to have a more generous system, rising to Â£800m next year, and to Â£1.4bn within five years.
It is, emphasises John Swinney, about choices. Some choices were forced on him: to delay delivery of government projects, though he did little to spell out which ones: a choice not to set a pay policy for next financial year, when it could inflame the unresolved disputes over pay in the current year.
made on tax come with downsides or at least risks.
One is that raising tax in a recession sucks money out of consumer spending and hurts business revenue and economic growth.
A counter-argument to that is that the same pounds put into the pay of a public sector worker or someone on benefits may be more likely to be spent in the economy. If it is a direct transfer, it can be efficient. Lots of other government spending may be less so.
r risk is that these 'behavioural effects' become more significant. We don't know the point at which people decide that Scotland's taxes are too high and they choose to leave, because every such decision is different, and often influenced by other factors.
Even at a high salary of Â£100,000, the gap between tax paid in Scotland and the bill in England is unlikely, on its own, to make it worthwhile for someone to sell their home and move out of Scotland.
But there is a perception issue for a country that aspires to attract people in, to fill vacancies in its health service, to work in senior positions at its universities, to start up businesses, or to build up tech companies with high-earning employees.
't have to make a calculation of how much higher tax might be. A perception of a country that levies higher tax, and is on a course of continuing to diverge in that direction, while not having much growth, may be a less attractive one for an internationally mobile high-value worker. 
Or it may have the makings of a 'social contract' - one of John Swinney's favourite phrases on budget day - which potential immigrants find attractive.
Either way, both the UK and Scotland seem to be on a journey towards resolving the tensions of wanting Scandinavian level services with American-level tax. 
Conservatives at Westminster are offering a big state for now, though some hanker for a much smaller one.
Scotland is moving faster towards the Scandi choice. But it will require a much more efficiently productive economy, breaking out of chronic low growth that will deliver on that vision. 
SFC report on the state of the economy was grim: unemployment forecast to rise to 4.7%, though from a low base, now at 3.3%; house prices falling by more than 5% and not fully recovering over five years; a recession through next year, which doesn't look as bad as the Bank of England forecast. 
And while it may be shallow, recovery is forecast to be weak - recovering to pre-recession output at the start of 2025, and not getting back to pre-Covid levels of late 2019 until the third quarter of 2025.
By 2026, when growth might reach 2%, the SFC indicates that we may be facing a new challenge of deflating prices.
After last decade's exceptionally weak recovery from the financial crash, this decade looks grim as well, in growth of the economy, and in an unprecedented fall in disposable household income. 
Without faster growth, meeting high expectations of public services will require higher and higher levels of tax."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63994465
health	Ulster Hospital: Bed pressures 'worse than during Covid'	"Emergency department situation 'worse than during Covid'
urrent pressure on hospital beds is ""worse than it was during Covid"", according to a senior manager at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.
Seaneen Pettigrew works in the hospital's discharge hub and her role is to free up beds by facilitating the discharge of medically-fit patients.
She said they were having difficulty securing care in the community for vulnerable patients leaving hospital.
Ms Pettigrew said demand for carers ""is currently outstripping supply"".
""We've more patients attending emergency department (ED), we've more patients coming through the hospital and more patients with complex needs who are needing more support on discharge than maybe previously,"" she said.
BBC News NI was granted access to the hospital's discharge hub this week, as well as its emergency department.
On Wednesday afternoon, 135 patients were in the emergency department, with 50 of those waiting for admission to a ward.
At the same time, there were 67 patients in the hospital who were ready to be discharged into the community, but could not leave because of delays securing onward care. 
One patient, who required admission to the hospital, had been waiting nearly 60 hours in the emergency department.
Seven ambulances were also waiting outside with patients onboard.
Andrew Dobbin, a consultant at the Ulster Hospital, warned that patients waiting long periods in emergency departments to be admitted are ""going to come to harm"".
He said there was ""almost a one-in-one out-policy"" due to delays discharging medically-fit patients.
Dr Dobbin said it had become normal to see 50 patients waiting in the department for admission to wards and for hospital staff to be under ""significant pressure"".
""We know, as our Royal College of Emergency Medicine has said, that crowding and long waits in emergency departments are directly linked to harm for patients and we know that patients staying here for long periods of time are going to come to harm.""
He added there were two reasons why emergency departments were facing ""significant problems"".
""The first thing is demand has increased and the second problem, which is the main problem at the moment, is that we have a significant number of patients who need to continue their care in hospital that we cannot move through our system to create the capacity to run an efficient, safe, effective emergency department.""
In the hospital's discharge hub a team of nurses, social workers, administrative staff and occupational therapists work seven days a week sourcing suitable placements for patients who are ready to leave hospital. 
Ms Pettigrew told BBC News NI that the ""picture is worse than it was during Covid"" because of the demand.
""The challenges we are having would be in accessing domiciliary care and sourcing appropriate care homes to facilitate patient discharge, and as a result those patients are delayed in hospital awaiting their care package or care home.""
Ms Pettigrew said the team at the discharge hub were appealing to patients and their families to work with them. 
""Given the challenges we may have to look at an alternative interim bed to go to, to await your package or await your home of choice.
""We know its not ideal, but it frees up the hospital bed for those patients waiting to come in through ED to also get the treatment that your loved one will have had.""
rge hub manager said there was a need to increase the number of care workers both within care homes and the domiciliary care sector. 
""It is a very complex issue within domiciliary care, the demand for the service is outstripping what's available at the minute.
""And then within our care home sector it is the appropriate care home placements for patients - potentially those who have complex nursing needs, complex behavioural needs.  It's trying to source the right placements for those patients,"" Ms Pettigrew explained. 
Separately, the number of people waiting for a first appointment with a consultant increased by 20,000 in a year, according to the latest figures from the Department of Health. 
More than 375,000 people were waiting to see a specialist at the end of September, up more than 5% from the same time last year.
Department of Health said its target by March next year is that at least 50% of people should not be waiting any longer than nine weeks for a first outpatient appointment.
urrent number of patients waiting longer than nine weeks is 82%, with over half of people on a waiting list for more than a year.
figures also show that almost 124,000 people were waiting to be admitted to hospital for inpatient or day care treatment.
And almost 164,000 patients were still waiting for a diagnostic test at the end of September - up 11% on the same time last year."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63746844
technology	EE to block pirate music mobile sites and apps	"EE is to become the first UK mobile network to block access to pirate music websites.
Industry body the British Phonographic Institute (BPI) successfully petitioned the courts to block file-sharing site The Pirate Bay in 2012.
High Court subsequently ordered broadband providers, including EE, to block more than 70 websites which allow people to download music illegally.
EE now plans to extend this ban to its mobile network.
An EE spokesperson said: ""Historically the majority of piracy took place on fixed line networks, but as network speeds increase and content file sizes for music decreases, mobile networks are seeing a rise in piracy. EE believe in supporting content creators by combatting piracy across both our mobile and fixed networks.""
Vodafone, Three, and O2 have been approached for comment.
Online piracy costs the record industry Â£200m a year, the BPI says.
Kiaron Whitehead, a lawyer for the BPI, said: ""A quarter of people now connect to the internet over 3G, 4G and 5G rather than broadband and wi-fi.
""That growth brings with it the risk of increased music piracy.
""The operators of these pirate sites make millions of pounds a year, without a penny going to the creators of the music they exploit. 
""We are therefore pleased that EE - which was the first mobile network to launch 5G to the UK population - has now become the first mobile network to block pirate sites.""
But Chris Elkins, co-founder and chief business development officer at Muso, a data company measuring unlicensed demand for digital content, told BBC News combating piracy was about more than simply blocking websites. 
""One of the things we've found is there needs to be a combination of legal effort and site blocking,"" he said. 
""Website blocking is really important... it needs to become routine and more cost-effective, and part of the arsenal that all media companies can utilise.
""And the legal offer - such as Spotify - is an example of a really positive service that has engaged consumers.
""It's about enforcing, making sure the piracy is harder to find, and creating stronger and stronger legal offers that the audience can engage with."""	/news/technology-62123815
entertainment	Prince Harry and Meghan say they didn't step back over privacy concerns	"WATCH: A clip from the first episode of the Harry and Meghan Netflix series
Duke and Duchess of Sussex have said they never cited privacy as a reason for stepping back from royal life.
Prince Harry and Meghan's global press secretary said a ""distorted narrative"" had been created.
It follows suggestions from some commentators that their Netflix series, which launched this week, is at odds with their reasons for leaving the UK.
ment said this was ""entirely untrue"".
It said they always intended to keep up public duties after leaving the royal family.
r decision to step back from royal life in early January 2020 was announced in two coordinated statements from the duke and duchess and Buckingham Palace.
In their statement at the time, the Sussexes said: ""We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth and our patronages.
""This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.""
At the time, one interpretation of their decision led to commentary suggesting that press intrusion, particularly that affecting their then-newborn son Archie, may have been a factor.
uple have engaged in separate legal battles against newspaper publishers, including over privacy, since they told several of the UK's biggest tabloid titles they would no longer cooperate with them.
Press intrusion is a theme that runs throughout the first three episodes of the new Netflix documentary, Harry & Meghan, which is co-produced by the couple.
And since the release of the episodes and two minute-long trailers, some commentators cited in the media have suggested they have changed their tune on the subject of privacy.
For example, Dickie Arbiter, a former press secretary to the late Queen, told GB News after watching the first three episodes on Thursday: ""They left because they wanted privacy. 
""Well, so much for privacy in this documentary because we are seeing a lot of family photographs.""
Another critic responding to one of the trailers was quoted by a newspaper as saying: ""They've blown their own protestations out of the water and detonated their own privacy policy.""
Sussexes' global press secretary, Ashley Hansen, said in a written statement: ""The Duke and Duchess have never cited privacy as the reason for stepping back. This distorted narrative was intended to trap the couple into silence.
""In fact, their statement announcing their decision to step back mentions nothing of privacy and reiterates their desire to continue their roles and public duties. Any suggestion otherwise speaks to a key point of this series.
""They are choosing to share their story, on their terms, and yet the tabloid media has created an entirely untrue narrative that permeates press coverage and public opinion. The facts are right in front of them."""	/news/uk-63922657

Some members at the Goju-Ryu Karate Academy in Newcastle, said they were uncomfortable wearing the suits.
roach to sensei Aaron Milan-Vega resulted in an option of wearing black.
Earlier this year it was announced female competitors at Wimbledon would be allowed to wear dark-coloured undershorts from next year.
ge black belt member Sylvie Gatherar approached her teacher with the idea.
15-year-old said: ""I think it's important to talk about things with your mentors in sport.
""Wearing white is like a paranoia in the back of your mind thinking 'what if this happens?', and that can affect performance and make it hard to concentrate. 
""I also think a lot of women don't do martial arts as they think it's too male-based.""
Mr Milan-Vega said he was ""keen to listen"" to his female members and has given all members the option of wearing darker trousers with the traditional white karate top.
""Maybe it's been a bit taboo in the past but it's important men listen and open it up for debate,"" he said.
""We used to be male-dominated but now we've got four women black belts and we're trying to make the sport more comfortable.""

politics	Pat Finucane: UK government in legal breach over investigation	"UK government remains in breach of its legal obligation to carry out an investigation into the murder of Pat Finucane, the High Court has ruled.
39-year-old Belfast solicitor was shot by loyalist gunmen in front of his wife and children in his home in 1989.
His family has campaigned for a public inquiry into his murder after several examinations of the case found state forces colluded in the attack.
His widow legally challenged the government over the lack of an inquiry.
In his ruling on Wednesday, the judge Mr Justice Scoffield quashed the government's decision not to establish a public inquiry.
He also said that former Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis had unlawfully failed to reconsider calling an inquiry after a police review process had ended.
judge said the government must make a new decision to address investigative deficiencies over the murder.
He said that Mr Finucane's widow Geraldine found herself ""in a sorry situation"" nearly four years after the UK Supreme Court declared that previous investigation into the killing failed to meet the standards required by Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
judge said: ""I have no hesitation in concluding that the United Kingdom government... remains in breach of Article 2 on the basis of the ongoing delay in completing an investigation which satisfies the requirements of that provision.""
Mr Finucane was described in court as the victim of a scheme in which loyalist paramilitaries were infiltrated, resourced and manipulated to target those identified for assassination.
A barrister for his widow argued that only a public inquiry would uncover the full extent of a state-operated policy of ""extrajudicial executions"".
In February 2019 the Supreme Court identified a continued breach of the requirement to hold an Article 2-compliant investigation.
Since then Mrs Finucane has mounted further legal battles against the government's response to that ruling.
In November 2020 Mr Lewis announced there would not be a public inquiry at that stage because he wanted other police reviews of the case to run their course.
He was ordered to pay Â£7,500 damages to Mrs Finucane for the excessive delay in reaching his position.
ge centred on the legality of his decision to await the outcome of reviews by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.
Mrs Finucane's legal team argued that the PSNI had now finished its work, while the ombudsman's process would not be completed until at least 2025.
It was argued that the decision taken by Mr Lewis was irrational, unlawful and a breach of human rights.
Although then Prime Minister David Cameron apologised in 2012 for the ""shocking"" levels of collusion in the case, the court heard that no members of the security forces had been held accountable for the killing.
A barrister representing the Northern Ireland secretary said there was no suggestion that the Supreme Court's findings against the government had not been accepted.
But he argued that Mr Lewis had been legally entitled to await the outcome of other police reviews.
judge rejected that those reviews would be ""capable of discharging"" the government's obligations in terms of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
He decided against compelling the government to establish a public inquiry, saying that it should be given an opportunity to consider its next step.
judge ordered current Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris to reconsider the government's response to the Supreme Court's findings.
He said he understood Mrs Finucane's concerns that the government had simply postponed ""a difficult choice in favour of buying further time"".
He added: ""If the secretary of state wishes to make a new case that an Article 2-compliant investigation is no longer feasible or would now be futile, he should do so.
""Ifâ¦ he does not make any such case but is nonetheless not prepared to establish a public inquiry or some other mechanism in order to remedy the Article 2 deficiencies identified by the Supreme Court... he should state that clearly and give his reasons."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64053473

A spokesperson said it had appointed dozens more staff since the inspection.
regulator found there was ""excellent care"" provided, but also ""low staff morale"" due to ""unrelenting pressures"" in terms of a lack of staff and beds.
Catherine Campbell, CQC head of hospital inspection, said: ""While people could access the service when they needed, it was worrying that they did not always receive the right care promptly due to pressures on bed capacity.""
report found there were ""significant numbers of patients unable to leave the hospital as they were waiting for onward care packages to be set up"".
rust has been told it ""must"" ensure that suitable equipment is provided in the escalation areas to meet the needs of patients.
It must also ""continue to act to recruit to vacant roles across the organisation,"" and ""ensure staff have time to complete training"".
rust was also told it ""should"" ensure all patients records were completed in full, consider an upgrade of some wards and continue to work with system partners to discharge patients appropriately.
Steve Williamson, chief executive of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, said since the inspection almost 40 additional registered nurses had been appointed as well as more than 20 healthcare support workers. 
He said: ""Improving our staffing levels will help to free up time for mandatory and specialist training and to support our ward leaders in nurturing open and supportive cultures within their teams.
Mr Williamson added that extra beds and assessment spaces had recently opened in the new frailty and same day emergency care unit, and they ""continued to work with health and care system partners"" on speeding up discharges.
CQC acknowledged the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Integrated Care Board was ""doing everything it can to improve this situation"" and said it ""would not hesitate to take action if needed to protect patients"" in the future.

politics	Tory MPs say they will continue naming asylum hotels	"Some Tory MPs have vowed not to be ""silenced"", after a refugee charity called for politicians to stop naming hotels housing people seeking asylum.
Refugee Council has written to the Commons Speaker urging him to ask MPs not to identify hotels to protect the safety of those staying there.
But several Tories said they would still ""name and shame"" hotels getting taxpayer money to house migrants.
UK spends almost Â£7m a day on hotels for asylum seekers and refugees.
Last month an immigration processing centre in Dover, Kent, was firebombed in an attack police have said was motivated by extreme right-wing terrorist ideology. 
In the Refugee Council letter, first reported by the Guardian, the charity's chief executive Enver Soloman said the ""horrific"" incident highlighted how asylum seekers were vulnerable to violent attacks by extremists. 
""It has been Home Office practice to not publicly name hotels where people are staying in order to guard their safety and privacy, but we know that increasingly MPs are naming specific premises when they raise this issue,"" he wrote. 
""It is of course right that MPs should be able to raise any constituency issue in Parliament, but this can be done without identifying a specific hotel and potentially making it more vulnerable to attack.""
Campaign group Hope Not Hate said it had recorded 182 visits from anti-immigration activists to migrant accommodation sites so far this year, some of which involved asylum seekers and security staff being harassed and filmed. 
However, Tory MP Lee Anderson, who represents Ashfield, wrote on Facebook: ""Like many of you, I am sick and tired of seeing our hospitality abused and people who are simply economic migrants cheating our system via small boats and dodgy human rights legislation.
""I will not be silenced and will name and shame these greedy hotel owners.""
Brendan Clarke-Smith, Tory MP for Bassetlaw, said he would always be ""welcoming to those in genuine need"" but posted a similar message, saying: ""I will not be silenced and will use the privileges given to me as a Member of Parliament to continue to speak out on this issue.""
Former Conservative minister David Davis has also raised concerns about plans to house asylum seekers at a specific hotel in his constituency of Haltemprice and Howden, as well as another which is already being used for the purpose. 
In response to the Refugee Council letter, he told the BBC: ""In most cases, and in most constituencies, the housing arrangements of migrants are hardly a secret.
""It is normally the case that hotels, or other facilities, housing migrants or asylum seekers [are] well known so I cannot see any strength in calls to restrict the freedom of speech of Members of Parliament in this matter.""
He added: ""It is particularly important for MPs to speak out about the housing of migrants in their constituency when it directly relates to the provision of services on which our constituents and the migrants rely such as healthcare and education.""
Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson, who chairs the Commons home affairs committee, said there was ""little to be gained from publicising the exact hotels"" asylum seekers were staying in, which she said could put them ""at greater risk"". 
A spokeswoman for Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle declined to comment.
Meanwhile, Home Office Minister Robert Jenrick suggested the government may have to ask rural areas and smaller towns to accommodate more migrants if the number of arrivals remained high. 
government is under pressure to tackle the increasing number of people crossing the Channel in small boats. 
Over the weekend the number of migrants who had made the dangerous journey so far this year passed 40,000 - the highest number since figures began to be collected in 2018.

sports	Eddie Jones: How England head coach ran out of road	"At times, the side hustles strayed to centre stage.
For England fans watching the 2019 Rugby World Cup from the sofa, the picture would sometimes cut from Eddie Jones glowering in the stands to a commercial break, and a wide shot of a food market in Sapporo.
Jones would be there, too - eating the meat from a giant crab leg and aiming a cheery thumbs-up to the camera to promote Japan's tourist board. 
A year earlier, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) had to apologise after Jones insulted the Welsh and Irish at a speaking gig for a Japanese truck-maker.
Australian would also spend his holidays from England duty coaching rival players as part of a long-standing, but awkward-looking, arrangement with a Tokyo club side.
His latest freelance project was a book. Entitled Leadership, its target audience was not confined to rugby circles - but there were some juicy insights thrown in. 
Mako Vunipola and George Ford discovered Jones regretted picking them for the World Cup final - the biggest match of their lives. Maro Itoje denied the book's claim he was having acting classes to improve his communication. 
Buried in it was a prediction about how Jones and England would eventually part ways.
""It's a sign of honour and wisdom to know when your race is run,"" wrote Jones. ""You've reached the end point and it is the moment for someone else with fresh energy and resolve to drive your organisation to a new destination.
""Of course it will happen to me and probably in not too many years from nowâ¦""
In the end, it was only one. The book was published on 25 November 2021. On 26 November 2022, Jones' side were booed off by the fans still remaining in a fast-emptying Twickenham.
r, the RFU, rather than Jones, decided he had run out of road.
Defeat by South Africa was England's sixth Test loss of the year. Statistically it is their worst since a chaotic 2008, when three different men took the reins. 
underlying trends in terms of tries scored, metres made, line breaks and defenders beaten are all down. But you don't need stats to see the void where a functioning game-plan and belief should be.
Jones' case to continue to the end of this contract and the conclusion of England's World Cup campaign would have been simple.
Every time he has gone to a World Cup, his sides have punched above their weight. 
Australia beat favourites New Zealand before pushing England to the limit in the 2003 final. He was on the staff of the South Africa side that won the 2007 tournament. His Japan team busted the Boks in Brighton in 2015.
run-up to the 2019 tournament wasn't smooth. England finished fifth in the 2018 Six Nations. A losing run stretched to six successive games in South Africa that summer. There were calls for him to be sacked. He stayed, though, and at the start of 2019 his masterplan materialised.
In Dublin, in their opening match of the year, England swept past Grand Slam champions and All Blacks conquerors Ireland. It was a display of immense power and minute precision.
g 91 seconds alone delivered variety, ambition, cohesion and a try.
Less than nine months later, New Zealand were put on the back foot by a similar blitz in the World Cup semi-final in Yokohama and never recovered. 
games were the twin peaks of Jones' time with England, along with an astonishing starting streak that took in a Grand Slam, two Six Nations titles and a 3-0 whitewashing of Australia.
ree years, though, have been fumbled, since being overpowered by South Africa in the 2019 World Cup final.

m was downscaled fast. This England never got to be measured against legends of the past, and the future Jones envisaged never emerged.
He said his team was being upskilled into a modern, adaptable, agile outfit that could outfox any opponent by France 2023.
ry sounded good. The reality did not look it.
As Jones searched for a solution, the coaching picture around him shifted like a kaleidoscope.
Neal Hatley, Scott Wisemantel, Simon Amor, Jason Ryles, John Mitchell and Anthony Seibold have all left posts since the 2019 World Cup.
And, over this autumn, patience in the process ran out.
grumbles from Twickenham's stands grew too loud for the RFU, which earns nearly 85% of its revenue from the stadium, to ignore.
Jones shed tears when he was sacked by Australia in 2005. This time, his regrets may be fewer.
His final chance to win a World Cup as a head coach may have gone. But, after seven years, his exit expands his horizons beyond Bagshot, where he lives and works - clocking into the England training centre for 17 hours a day during the season.
He has been linked with the United States job and Paris-based club Racing 92.
For now though, having warned his players of the dangers of commercial distractions, Jones' diary suddenly has a whole lot more time for them."	/sport/rugby-union/63795234
politics	Londoners could vote for two more MPs at an election	"Londoners could vote for more MPs at the next general election as part of constituency boundary changes. 
Boundary Commission for England has published its final revised proposals to be finalised by 2023.
How the boundaries are set can be controversial as moving the borders can bring in voters who are in favour of different political parties.
Electoral boundaries, which divide parliamentary constituencies, change every five years. 
re revised to stay in keeping with population changes, so that MPs represent roughly the same number of voters each.
Under the current proposed revision in London, Labour would have potentially won an extra three seats in the 2019 general election.
But across the country, the Conservative Party would have won five more seats.
If the new boundaries are in place in time for the next general election, which has to take place in 2025 at the latest, the number of MPs in London would increase by two, with 75 constituencies in total.
Conservatives could gain support in former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Uxbridge & South Ruislip constituency as it would include some new areas that are more Tory leaning.
ry MP Iain Duncan Smith could be at a disadvantage in Chingford & Woodford Green, where the new boundaries would take in more of Redbridge and become, in theory, more Labour leaning.
Some constituencies would no longer exist at all, like Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey's Kingston & Surbiton seat, because Kingston town centre would be absorbed into Richmond Park, which is held by his fellow Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney. 
Sir Ed has said he would contest the newly created Surbiton & the Maldens seat.
As for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, his Holborn & St Pancras seat would remain largely unchanged. 
And shadow health secretary Wes Streeting would see moderate changes to the borders of his Ilford North seat, but they would be unlikely to make much difference politically.
ublic can have their say until 5 December on the Boundary Commission for England's third and final consultation on the new electoral map, with the final recommendations expected to be submitted to Parliament in July.

He has already attended events in Maidenhead, Newport and Dundee this month.
Wicks will also walk 30 miles (48km) in an ultra-marathon challenge on Friday.
Wicks, 37, whose online workouts during the pandemic reached huge audiences, said he was encouraging families to take up Parkrun events regularly.
Wicks, who was awarded an MBE for his work, said: ""I'm a massive advocate of moving the body to help the mind, and walking and talking with family and friends has always been really important to me. 
""Walk with Joe is an easy and accessible way for people of all abilities to come together and reconnect, while helping to raise money for children and young people across the UK. 
""By getting together, we can make a real difference. I'm so excited to meet the families and lead some of the routes.
""I hope everyone comes along to support such a great cause.""
Walkers will also be asked to make donations to BBC Children in Need, which supports children and young people in communities across the UK.

health	Newcastle mental health charity overwhelmed by demand	"A mental health charity has paused new referrals until January because of a huge rise in requests for help. 
Recovery College Collective (ReCoCo) said rising demand in the last six months was largely due to longer NHS mental health services waiting times.
People with mental health issues had increased after the pandemic and with the cost of living crisis, it said.
Newcastle charity said it would direct people to other services or put them on courses for the new year.
Despite the recent surge in requests for help, ReCoCo's co-director Angela Glasscott fears demand has not yet peaked.
""It's potentially overwhelming for us,"" she said.
""There's so much backlog in the whole system, so we're getting people who are sitting on waiting lists for everything else. 
""Unfortunately, we have had to close our doors until January while we're dealing with that backlog.""
rity, which has 15 staff - half of them part-time, offers a range of support including mindfulness workshops, understanding medication sessions and suicide prevention. 
People can choose as much support as they want and either sign up for a block of classes or do drop-in sessions.
rity said attendance had doubled since this time last year and while it usually receives eight referrals a week, during one week in September that ""exploded"" to 80. 
It already has 2,000 people on its books and says demand will continue to grow over the winter months. 
Lucy Graves, a mental health social worker in Gateshead, says it is a vital service.
""A lot of mental health services have a lot of referral criteria,"" she said.
""The waiting lists are massive. People can go and ask for support and be waiting a very long time. Here, you can walk in, feel welcomed, and get signed up straight away.""
Alexandra started attending ReCoCo when the charity was recommended by her GP and said the sessions have helped build her confidence.
""Here, you can say you're not all right and people say 'yeah, fair enough',"" she said. 
""No-one is uncomfortable with you talking about mental health. It's a safe space to do that.""

Annan-based senior immunisation nurse Jane Naylor has played a significant part in carrying out that programme across the region.
She has not kept count of how many people she has vaccinated but it runs to thousands. ""I've jabbed a fair few folk, put it that way,"" she said.
Covid shook up her life as an immunisation nurse.
""We were a very small team of maybe about 15 to 20 people,"" she said.
""We worked quietly behind the scenes, vaccinating children, the elderly - you know - everything from the cradle to the grave.
""We were so small that nobody really knew about us - we just got on with it and protected everybody.""
was before it ""all kicked off"" and the team was switched to carrying out Covid swab tests in April 2020.
""I must admit we were absolutely petrified because it was scary - we didn't know what to expect really,"" she said.
""There were days when we we just stood and we cried because we just thought: 'I don't want to come into work - I really don't'.
""But we did, we came in and we saw some really poorly people driving up in cars, got them tested and away they went.""
Of their normal work, only baby vaccinations carried on - everything else was put on hold until the first Covid vaccines came out in December that year.
""Even that was scary times,"" said Jane.
""We weren't quite sure what to expect from this Pfizer vaccine because we were told you can't move it once you have mixed it up.
""You felt as if you had like a ticking time bomb in your hands, thinking I'd better not move that as if it was going to explode or something.""
She went out into care homes and then to vaccination centres at Mountainhall in Dumfries and the Newington Sports Centre in Annan.
Jane said it was great to be able to give out vaccines.
""That was brilliant, that was amazing - we just thought thank goodness for that because we are going to protect people and as a nurse that's what you want to do,"" she said.
""You want to make people well, you want to keep them well, you want to make them feel safe.
""It was an absolute relief, not only for us - but I think for the general public as well, to say thank goodness, we're actually going to see a light at the end of the tunnel.""
She moved from delivering vaccinations to overseeing the whole project but reckons she must have administered thousands of injections over the past two years.
A team of seven or eight at the Newington Sports Centre would deal with about 400 people a day.
""On average we would probably do about 60 people a day and that was five days a week so you would be doing, you know, over 300-a-week,"" she said.
""There's probably people that have done a lot more than me.""
As well as at the main centres, the team travelled across the area to Canonbie, Langholm, Moffat, Lockerbie and Lochmaben.
She said people in Dumfries and Galloway had been great - although there were exceptions.
""You get people that come in that are quite argumentative actually,"" she said.
""They come in and they say: 'I'm not having that vaccine'.
""I try to explain to my patients these diseases haven't gone away - your dyptheria, tetanus, polio, whooping cough - it is just that we have protected ourselves against the worst of those symptoms.""
She said it was all about giving a ""positive message"" about vaccines and, now, encouraging people not to give in to ""vaccine fatigue"".
""A little jab in your arm to save your life - I don't think that's much to ask,"" she said.
""We are not asking you to run a marathon, we are just asking you to sit down, listen to us for a couple of minutes, get a jab and bye-bye and thank you very much.""
She said that Scotland's response had been impressive.
""We've just stepped up and done it and that's it,"" she said.
""You know it just has to be done.
""And that's a great attitude to have - it is very Scottish - come on, just get on with it."""	/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-63987721

health	China Covid: Beijing eases some curbs despite rising cases	"China has slightly relaxed some of its Covid restrictions even as case numbers rise to their highest levels in months.
Quarantine for close contacts will be cut from seven days in a state facility to five days and three days at home.
Officials will also stop recording secondary contacts - meaning many people will avoid having to quarantine.
ght easing comes weeks after Xi Jinping was re-instated as party leader for a historic third term.
Mr Xi held his first Covid meeting with his newly elected Standing Committee on Thursday. 
China's zero-Covid policy has saved lives in the country of 1.4 billion people but also dealt a punishing blow to the economy and ordinary people's lives.
re is increasing public fatigue over lockdowns and travel restrictions. 
Stories of suffering and desperation have also circulated on social media, fuelling many outbursts of civic anger.
China's National Health Commission (NHC) insisted the changes did not amount to ""relaxing prevention and control, let alone opening up"", but were instead designed to adapt to a changing Covid situation.
NHC also said it would develop a plan to speed up vaccinations.
On Friday, the changes were announced even as the country grapples with its worst wave of Covid in months.
f Beijing, Guangzhou and Zhengzhou are currently seeing record numbers. 
On Thursday, China recorded over 10,500 new Covid cases - the highest daily total since April when China shut down its largest city Shanghai to combat a wave there.
People in China, and analysts watching the country, have been waiting for some indication from the government that strict Zero-Covid measures might be eased.
On the one hand, Beijing is not officially backing down from its commitment to its current strategy, but it has announced a series of measures it has described as ""adapting"" to the situation rather than ""relaxing"" the policy.
For Chinese people who have become exhausted by Zero-Covid it doesn't really matter if the government finds the need to save face semantically, as long as the changes are real and that they are.
moves announced today may not seem like much if you are not living in China but, inside the country, three years into a crisis, with no indication of when or how an off ramp may appear, any steps towards re-opening are steps which are not going backwards.
Ending the punishment for airlines carrying infected passengers will mean more flights, more seats, cheaper inbound tickets, and an end to abrupt Covid-induced cancellations. This is significant.
A reduction of seven days in hotel quarantine plus three days at home to five days plus three is only a small alteration but the expectation is that this could continue to come down at some point in the future.
Again, for a country with an economy being smashed by Zero-Covid, baby steps are better than no steps.
Raising the bar for centralised quarantine inside China will also ease tensions for ordinary people, if only because it provides a glimmer of light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
It is hard to explain to people in other countries just how fed up with Zero-Covid locals have become. They were living through this crisis well before the rest of the world and while other countries have now found a way to move on, they're still stuck with it, as if China has been frozen in a massive 2020 time block.
Despite the small changes however, most restrictions still remain in place. Mr Xi has insisted on sticking to a stringent zero-Covid policy involving lockdowns even as the rest of the world has moved on. 
means in many cities residents have been subject to sudden restrictions on their movement and disruptions to work and schooling.
For example, this week in Guangzhou - the current epicentre of the Covid wave in China - locals in one district were barred from venturing outside and only one member of each household was allowed outside to grocery shop.
Public transport has been suspended while schools and workplaces are also shut down.
In Zhengzhou, another Covid centre at the moment, lockdowns there prompted many workers living at a vast factory owned by Taiwanese iPhone-maker Foxconn to flee the area on foot to escape restrictions."	/news/world-asia-china-63594255
business	Red Bull loses trademark dispute with gin firm Bullards	"A small gin-maker which dates back to 1837 has won a legal battle against energy drinks manufacturer Red Bull.
Norwich-based Bullards was told by lawyers acting for Red Bull there was a ""likelihood of confusion on behalf of the public"" as both brand names ""include the term bull"".
A hearing ruled Red Bull's opposition to the trademark application failed. 
A Red Bull spokesperson said: ""We do not believe it appropriate to comment on such a legal matter.""
Russell Evans, of Bullards, said he was ""glad"" they had taken a stance and did not ""cave in to the Goliaths"".
Red Bull had asked Bullards to delete a series of goods and services from its trademark application and registration, including energy drinks, events and non-alcoholic beverages.
Allan James, senior hearing officer at the UK Intellectual Property Office, wrote as part of his decision: ""Bullards is not in any way a logical brand extension of Red Bull.""
Bullards was founded by Richard Bullard, making beer and importing wine and spirits, before it was taken over by national brewery Watneys in 1963.
Bullards name was revived in 2015, with the company focusing on gin.
Austrian firm Red Bull was launched in 1987, some 150 years after Bullards.
Russell Evans, of Bullards, said some people had advised him to do as Red Bull asked as they had ""deeper pockets than us"".
""But it just seemed wrong to just cave in to the Goliaths so we decided to take a stance and I'm glad we did,"" he added.
""It just begs the question as to why they think they can do things like this when all they did was start something that's now been thrown out but it's cost me Â£30,000 to defend.""
He said that Bullards did not want to make energy drinks, but Red Bull ""also wanted us to not do soft drinks, which we do, and they also wanted us to stop doing events, which is ridiculous"".
""My view was even though we don't want to do energy drinks, I didn't want to concede to them the fact that they had the right to do so and we didn't,"" he said.
Luke Portnow, trade mark attorney for Bullards, said: ""We stood firm that Bullards and Red Bull are of such different trade, no amount of reputation in energy drinks was enough to prevent use and registration here.""
George Bullard, a great-great-great-grandson of the brand's founder, said: ""We're thrilled with the hearing outcome and the continuity which it embodies.""

politics	Fox hunting: Fresh demands to toughen laws ahead of hundreds of meets	"re are fresh calls to strengthen the ban around fox hunting ahead of more than 200 meets on Boxing Day.
Countryside Alliance says it is the first time in three years traditional meets will go ahead in full.
Using dogs to chase or kill foxes was made illegal in England and Wales in 2004 in the Hunting Act.
Labour has called for stricter laws around fox hunting after it claimed there have been less than 450 convictions in over a decade.
Official figures compiled by Labour show 438 convictions - including 42 last year - were secured since 2010 under the Hunting Act.
Labour wants to close ""loopholes"" in the law and says trail hunting - which involves laying a scent for hounds to chase instead of a live animal - is being used as a ""smokescreen"" for the illegal hunting of foxes.
Countryside Alliance, which campaigns for the return of fox hunting, accused Labour of harbouring a ""pointless political vendetta against hunting"".
Chairman Nick Herbert said: ""Labour's position is utterly illogical and the large number of prosecutions under the Hunting Act only shows that the legislation is perfectly effective.""
Reacting to Labour's figures a government spokesman said: ""The Hunting Act 2004 makes it an offence to hunt a wild mammal with dogs and anyone who believes that an offence has taken place should report the matter to the police.

Under plans, the grant would open to people whose mortgage payments had risen by more than 10% of their income.
It could be paid for by reversing tax cuts for banks, the party has said.
Sir Ed Davey said: ""No family should face losing their home because of the Conservative's reckless mismanagement of the economy.""
Liberal Democrat leader will give a speech in London on Sunday, after the death of Queen Elizabeth II led to his party's annual conference being cancelled in September. 
He will attack the Conservatives for planning tax rises and cuts to public services, likening ministers to ""bank robbers asking for a loan to buy the getaway car"". 
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said the government had ""trashed"" the economy and that struggling families were seeing their mortgage payments go up by ""hundreds of pounds a month"".
Sir Ed said: ""I am quite alarmed that the Conservatives who caused this mess are not actually trying to help.""
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said the proposed grant would only go to those who were ""really struggling"" - for example, those facing repossession or homelessness.
Asked why the help did not apply to renters, Sir Ed said the party did have a package for those renting and highlighted the housing benefit support already available. 
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is due to deliver an autumn budget on 17 November, but has already warned of ""eye-wateringly difficult decisions"". 
udget was taken after the tax plans of Liz Truss sparked turmoil in financial markets.
Following a backlash, she was forced to sack her chancellor and reverse her proposals. She later resigned as prime minister, to be replaced by Rishi Sunak.
Sir Ed argued that Conservative actions had ""added hundreds [of pounds] to people's monthly mortgages"". 
""The government has a responsibility to step in and fix their own mess, by providing grants to those struggling to afford eye-watering mortgage hikes.""
Sir Ed will also use his speech to attack Mr Sunak's re-appointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary, less than a week after she had to resign for breaking data security rules. 
""Johnson-like integrity, Johnson-like judgement - Nadhim Zahawi said it was time for Boris 2.0. With Rishi Sunak, it looks like he got his wish,"" he is expected to say. 
Looking ahead to the Liberal Democrats' general election prospects, Sir Ed will argue that his party is well-positioned to win seats in traditional Conservative heartlands, dubbed ""the blue wall"". 
In the past year, the party has had success beating the Tories in by-elections in Shropshire, Buckinghamshire and Devon. However it remains one of the smaller parties at Westminster with just 14 MPs.
Under the Liberal Democrat's mortgage protection fund, grants would be offered to homeowners to protect them from losing their homes or falling into arrears.
rty estimates this would cost Â£3bn and says it could be paid for by reversing cuts to the bank levy and bank surcharge. 
rage interest rate charged by mortgage lenders has hit its highest level for 14 years.
A homeowner is considered to be in arrears if they miss two or more months' repayments, However, lenders are required to make reasonable attempts to reach an agreement with those struggling to meet their payments. "	/news/uk-politics-63514047

politics	UK faces tougher austerity era - ex-Bank chief	"UK faces a ""more difficult"" era of austerity than the one after the 2008 financial crisis in order to stabilise the economy, a former governor of the Bank of England has warned.
Lord Mervyn King said the average person could face ""significantly higher taxes"" to fund public spending.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is scheduled to set out his economic plans on 31 October.
He has already scrapped almost all the tax cuts announced under Liz Truss.
Mr Hunt has said: ""This government will take the difficult decisions necessary to ensure there is trust and confidence in our national finances.
""That means decisions of eye-watering difficulty.""
Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Lord King said that ""it is time to front up"" with the public about the difficulties the country is facing.
He said ""public expenditure isn't going down, if anything it will go up therefore taxes will have to rise to fill the gap which is there at present"".
""That doesn't make a very happy picture for the next few years,"" said Lord King. 
""But what we need is a government that will actually tell us honestly there is a reduction in our national standard of living because we've decided to help Ukraine and confront Russia and that means that all of us are going to have to share the burden, we can't just put all of it on our children and grandchildren.""
After the 2007-2008 financial crisis, when the banking sector came close to collapse, the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government announced the sharpest cuts in public spending since the end of World War Two. 
Asked if the UK could be facing a similar period of austerity, Lord King, who was governor at the time, said: ""In some ways it could be more difficult.""
He said: ""The challenge is if we want European levels of welfare payments and public spending, you cannot finance that with American levels of tax rates, so we may need to confront the need to have significantly higher taxes on the average person.
""There isn't enough money there among the rich to get it back."" 
Mr Hunt has reversed nearly all the tax cuts set out in September's mini-budget. This included a 1p cut in income tax which was due in April. A decision to cut the top rate of tax for people earning Â£150,000 or more had already been scrapped. 
Uncertainty remains, however, about public spending, as the Conservative Party undertakes another leadership race to choose a leader and prime minister to replace Ms Truss.  
Last week, Ms Truss said she was committed to a Tory manifesto pledge in 2019, made by the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson,  to raise pensions in line with prices.   
riple lock means state pension payments rise by whatever is higher - inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.
On Sunday, Rishi Sunak declared he was in the running to take over as Tory leader and prime minister and said he would ""deliver on the promise of the 2019 manifesto"". 
Leadership rival Penny Mordaunt said: ""We have a majority and a mandate to deliver a true 2019 manifesto."" Mr Johnson is also expected to announce his candidacy, according to Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg but is yet to make a formal statement.
On Sunday, Lord King also reiterated criticism of central banks for failing to curb inflation which is now running at a 40-year high of 10.1%. 
He said major central banks, including the Bank of England, had continued to ""print money"" - through a measure known as quantitative easing - to support their economies during Covid lockdowns. This, he said, had contributed to rising inflation.
Lord King was governor of the Bank of England between 2003 and 2013 during which time it launched quantitative easing. But he said there was a difference between that period when major economies were dealing with the global financial crisis and the impact of Covid lockdowns. 
""Engaging in quantitative easing in 2009 was to stop the economy from going into another recession because the amount of money in the economy was going down,"" he said.
""Here in the last couple of years the amount of money in the economy has grown very rapidly and at a pace that was bound to lead to higher inflation."""	/news/business-63364240
health	Urology: Aidan O'Brien's patients 'missed out on essential care'	"An inquiry into the clinical practice of a consultant urologist has heard how he refused to involve specialist cancer care nurses on his team.
A senior cancer specialist said patients under Mr Aidan O'Brien's care at Craigavon Area Hospital missed out due to the ""luck of the draw"".
All other patients received this care, the specialist said.
quiry is examining Mr O'Brien's work at the Southern Health trust between January 2019 and June 2020.
Earlier in November, the inquiry heard that almost 600 patients received ""suboptimal care"" as his patients.
Dr Dermot Hughes was involved in a review of nine serious incidents involving the urologist.
He told the inquiry he found it unusual that cancer care nurses were not involved in any of his cases.
Dr Hughes said that, in his experience, it was normal practice for care to be shared and that cancer care nurses were integral.
""That way, there is seamless care - so there is a clinical care nurse specialist either to support the patient or to be with the patient or to inform the patient of their illness,"" said Dr Hughes.
""In my experience, the professional giving the care should be the person referring the patient to the clinical care specialist. 
""But the issue here in the Southern Trust is that, clearly, Mr O'Brien did not work with clinical work specialists in his oncology clinics. 
""He did not involve them in the classic roles of cancer nurse specialists in terms of holistic assessment, informing patients of their disease and discussing their options.""
Dr Hughes said his reviews found that this situation had been raised by nurses with the trust but that it had failed to act.   
""The practice in the Southern Trust was that all other patients received this care in tandem with their consultant, but a separate cohort did not,"" he said.
""That issue was known but not dealt with.""
quiry, chaired by Christine Smith KC, also heard from urologist Mr Hugh Gilbert who worked in the review team with Dr Hughes. 
He described the benefits of having a care nurse assigned for cancer patients undergoing treatment, saying ""it continuously allows the patient access to information and support"".
""It just so happens that the best-placed person for that is a cancer nurse specialist as they have not only knowledge of the medical aspects of care but also in the nursing aspects of care which are fundamental to a patient's wellbeing,"" said Mr Gilbert.
""At the time of discussion (of a patient's diagnosis), a key worker is appointed and that is usually, almost inevitably, a cancer nurse specialist. 
""They are named and their name is put on all printed materials.""
Dr Hughes said families were concerned to learn from the review team that their relatives were being treated differently and missed out on vital support.
""The role of the cancer nurse specialist really is essential.
""It is informative; patients receive better experience and the families found it difficult to know that the majority of patients received this and their cohort did not.
""The care that is delivered by those nurses in the Southern Trust was exemplary. 
""But for these patients it was the luck of the draw because they were allocated a particular professional, they didn't get this service.""
Mr O'Brien worked at the Southern Health Trust from 1992 until his retirement in July 2020.
He was temporarily excluded from the workplace in 2017 before returning under supervision.

technology	Microsoft-Activision deal: Gamers sue to stop merger	"Microsoft faces legal action from 10 gamers to block its merger with Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.
wsuit filed in a US federal court says the $69bn (Â£56bn) deal by the Xbox console maker to purchase its rival will ""create a monopoly in the video game industry"".
mplaint comes two weeks after US regulators filed a case with an administrative judge to block the deal. 
merger would be the largest tech deal ever in the video gaming market. 
roposed acquisition would give Microsoft ""far-outsized market power in the video game industry,"" according to the complaint ""with the ability to foreclose rivals, limit output, reduce consumer choice, raise prices, and further inhibit competition.""
However, Microsoft is defending the proposed acquisition. ""This deal will expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers as we seek to bring more games to more people,"" according to a spokesman.  
Almost two weeks ago, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) raised similar concerns in their complaint. The US business watchdog said Activision was one of a small number of top video game developers that made high-quality games for multiple devices.
roposed acquisition would give Microsoft ""both the means and motive to harm competition"" by manipulating pricing, making games worse on its competitors' video game consoles, ""or withholding content from competitors entirely, resulting in harm to consumers,"" the agency said in a press release.  
After the FTC filed its lawsuit, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the company had ""complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court"".
Microsoft also announced it will make Call of Duty available on Nintendo for 10 years if the purchase went through and made a similar offer to rival Sony which makes the PlayStation console.
""This sounds alarming, so I want to reinforce my confidence that this deal will close,"" Activision Blizzard chief executive Bobby Kotick wrote in a letter to staff that was shared on the company's website. ""The allegation that this deal is anti-competitive doesn't align with the facts, and we believe we'll win this challenge.""

health	Angela Rayner: Covid contract VIP lane was 'a scandal of epic proportions'	"""VIP lane"" to fast track companies recommended by MPs and peers for Covid contracts was a ""scandal of epic proportions"", Labour has said.
Deputy leader Angela Rayner said it ""allowed the shameful waste of taxpayers' money and inexcusable profiteering by Tory cronies"".
But Minister Nick Gibb said at the start of the pandemic ""we were desperate"" to get protective equipment.
Labour is trying to force ministers to publish correspondence about contracts.
At a Commons debate later, the party will present a motion to MPs calling for the release of documents and advice relating to government contracts awarded to one company, PPE Medpro. 
government has faced questions over the company's alleged links to Conservative peer Michelle Mone. 
If Labour's motion passes then the government would have to publish the documents, although they may argue they can be redacted for legal reasons or because of commercial sensitivity. 
Conservative MPs are expected to abstain from the vote, which would allow the motion to pass. 
f the so-called VIP lane was to treat offers of personal protective equipment (PPE) with greater urgency if they came from a supplier recommended by ministers, government officials or MPs and peers from any party. 
Schools Minister Mr Gibb said the government saved ""hundreds of thousands of lives"" by procuring PPE at speed at the beginning of the pandemic. 
""The government had to do everything it could to persuade manufacturers to shift their production,"" he told BBC Breakfast. 
However, Ms Rayner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't accept that cronyism and this level of scandal is to do with a panic.""
Between May and June 2020, PPE Medpro was awarded two government contracts worth Â£203m to supply masks and medical gowns.
Unusually, the company was only a few weeks old when it signed the first of these agreements. 
In December 2020, BBC News reported that millions of medical gowns the firm supplied, worth Â£122m, had never been used. 
PPE Medpro said at the time that it had delivered 100% of the contract to the terms specified and that it had supplied equipment ""fully in accordance with the agreed contract, which included clear terms as to technical specification and performance criteria of the products"".
Department of Health said: ""Due diligence was carried out on all companies that were referred to the department and every company was subjected to the same checks.""
rtment is currently in mediation with PPE Medpro over what it has described as an ""underperforming contract"" and said it was unable to comment on specifics. 
Glasgow-born businesswoman Baroness Mone, who joined the House of Lords in 2015, is being investigated by the Lords commissioner for standards over her ""alleged involvement"" in procuring contracts for the company.
However, the commissioner says he is unable to finalise or publish his report because ""the matter is under investigation by the police or another agency as part of a criminal investigation"".
Properties linked to the company have previously been searched by the National Crime Agency.
Emails released under Freedom of Information laws show Baroness Mone referring the company to a government minister during the pandemic.
Last month, Ms Rayner accused the government of a ""total failure of due diligence"" and a ""conflict of interest"" in awarding the contracts to PPE Medpro.
She was responding to an investigation in the Guardian based on leaked documents that alleged Baroness Mone had financially benefited from the company.
She told MPs it appeared ""tens of millions of pounds"" from the money awarded to the company ""ended up in offshore accounts connected to the individuals involved"". 
Baroness Mone has not responded to requests for comment. 
However, asked in December 2020 about reports she was linked to the company, her lawyers told BBC News she ""had no role or function in PPE Medpro, nor in the process by which contracts were awarded to PPE Medpro"".
Separately, Matt Hancock has accused Baroness Mone of being aggressive and threatening when trying to secure another government contract for Covid tests. 
In his book, Pandemic Diaries, Mr Hancock claimed she had demanded ""urgent help"" to secure contracts in an email in June 2021, when he was health secretary. 
Mr Hancock has not named the firm but the Daily Mail reported it was not PPE Medpro. 
He said he was later told the tests had not won any contracts because they had not passed the standards required and he chose not to reply to the ""extraordinarily aggressive email"". "	/news/uk-politics-63870910

sports	Tokyo Olympics: Laura and Jason Kenny win gold medals as son Albie watches from home	"They were already Great Britain's golden couple but Jason and Laura Kenny cemented their place in Olympic history with a gold medal each at Tokyo 2020.
Yet arguably their proudest moment came a year earlier.
Laura posted a video on Instagram in June 2020 of her running carefully alongside their then two-year-old son Albie as he successfully learned to ride a bike.external-link
re two of the strongest track cyclists in the world and they are also the best parents they can be to Albie, who will be four in August.
And, as for any parent trying to find the sweet spot between chasing their dreams and raising their child, it does not always come easily.
""I have never missed you more little man,"" Laura posted alongside an image of Albie watching her on television when she won team pursuit silver on Tuesday - the first time she has missed out on gold at the Olympics.
ree days later she was back on the top of the podium as Laura and Katie Archibald put on a cycling masterclass to dominate the women's madison to become the first British woman to win a gold medal at three Olympics.
On the final day of action, Jason was re-writing history himself as he won a seventh gold medal in a thrilling keirin race, becoming the most successful British Olympian of all time.
When it was announced that both husband and wife would represent GB in Tokyo, Laura said she ""massively underestimated how hard it would be to juggle both being a parent and us both being athletes"".external-link
As the 29-year-old was making her return to the sport after giving birth, an endeavour in which she was supported by fellow mum and Olympic champion Jess Ennis-Hill, she said she had to build her training around Albie rather than the other way round.
ge was made even more difficult by the coronavirus lockdown, meaning the pair could no longer rely on the support of grandparents to help care for Albie while they trained.
But the Kennys are ""tough"", says six-time Olympic champion Sir Chris Hoy.
ughness is what it took for Laura to return from a broken shoulder and arm sustained 18 months before the Games.
It is how Jason, 33, got back to being one of Britain's best after taking a year away from the sport post-Rio.
And toughness has surely been required to do all of that while raising a toddler.
""Albie came along and it just changed everything,"" Laura told the BBC before the Games.
""I just sort of relaxed a lot more. Every time I go home I just switch off. I always thought I wanted to be a young mum and I didn't want to let it get in the way of my career.
""I wanted to prove to myself that I could do both.""
Albie might make the logistics of finding time to train more complicated, but as both aimed to make their mark in the history books he has also provided vital motivation.
""I'd never been injured before, certainly not to that extent,"" she said of the injuries sustained in two major crashes in early 2020.
""It was the hardest couple of weeks in my career because I thought 'why am I doing this?' I do it all for Albie now. I've not sacrificed all this time with him for no reason.""
Jason now has nine medals in total, adding keirin gold and team sprint silver in Tokyo, to surpass Sir Bradley Wiggins, who also has eight in all.
According to data company Nielsen Gracenote, between them the married couple have won a third of all the gold medals claimed by Great Britain in the history of Olympic track cycling.
Sir Chris knows what it takes to achieve such greatness but he never tried to do it while being a parent, instead waiting until he had retired to have children.
""I've got no idea [what that's like],"" he said.
""It adds another dimension to the stress and difficulty that being a parent can bring.
""It balances it out with the joy you get from it and also the perspective. When you are lining up for an Olympic final, perspective is one of the things that can really help you cope with pressure.
""They complement each other. Jason's calmness can settle Laura when she might get a bit nervous or worry about things too much. She drags Jason up and picks his spirits up. They live for their sport and for their little boy Albie. 
""It just makes you so happy to see nice folk succeeding in life.""
Even their relationship has followed Olympic cycles. Laura took to Twitter to announce they were ""dating"" when they were caught kissing on camera at the London 2012 beach volleyball final.
got married after returning from Rio 2016 and Albie was born a year later.
r are now adding a Tokyo chapter to their Olympic story and both Jason and Hoy believe there will be much more to come from Laura at Paris 2024. And Jason hasn't 100% ruled out a fifth Games appearance.
Jason said before the Games his wife would ""trump"" any medal record he sets, adding it ""would be short-lived"".
""In two or three Games' time we will be looking back and Laura could have 10 gold medals,"" Hoy agreed. ""The best is possibly yet to come from Laura. I firmly expect Laura to be standing alone above Jason and above Bradley.""
And Laura may not even be the most successful Kenny, with Albie apparently well on the way in his cycling education.
""He's got a lot of expectation,"" joked Sir Chris.
""The poor lad has got a lot of pressure. He's got to take up something entirely different."""	/sport/olympics/58069122
sports	Antrim Football Final: Curses, resilience and family - Cargin's story	"It's almost hard to believe about a club fancied to land a sixth Antrim Football title in eight years on Sunday but Cargin used to be renowned for losing county Finals.
When they take to the field at Corrigan Park against a St Mary's Aghagallon who have never won the title, it will be the Erin's Own outfit's 21st Antrim Final in 35 years.
Looking back at those deciders since 1987, Cargin lost seven of their first eight finals before securing back-to-back titles in 1999 and 2000 with victories over St Paul's - the second of which we will have to elaborate on later.
Geordie McGuckin, the former club secretary whose tenure included being the man delegated to eloquently explain the occasional playing field indiscretion to the prying press, has seen them all and a lot more.
After the Toome club won their first Antrim Championship in 1974, they didn't reach another county decider until the 1987 defeat by St John's and four further final reverses occurred before they got their hands on the 1995 title.
It hasn't quite gone down in legend like the infamous Mayo curse but there was a tale doing the rounds that somebody had put a spell on the Cargin team during the 21-year famine.
""People listened to silly old craic about somebody cursing Cargin,"" recalls Geordie. 
""Some guy, I can't remember who it was, said Cargin would 'win one silver [Antrim title] and one alone'.""
And even after the Toome men broke their losing sequence by beating St John's in 1995, further final reverses followed in 1996 and 1998 against St Paul's and the Johnnies.
Irish News' match report from the 1996 finalexternal-link detailed a half-time scuffle involving ""players, substitutes, officials and even a few spectators"" as the west Belfast club edged a 1-11 to 0-13 win.
But that outbreak of hostilities was small beer compared to the infamous 2000 decider at Casement Park against St Paul's which ended in chaos as personnel from both clubs and spectators waded into each other out on the pitch for close to five minutes.
When the brawl broke out in the fifth minute of injury time, Cargin were 0-9 to 0-5 ahead and while they were initially declared winners, disciplinary chiefs stripped the Erin's Own outfit of the title, although that decision was overturned years later and the record books now document the Toome club as 2000 champions.
""I was having to go to the disciplinary board quite often,"" recalls McGuckin of that turbulent but successful period in Cargin's history.
With players and the clubs both receiving bans, the 2000 final and its aftermath did no favours to Antrim manager Brian White, whose side - replete with Cargin and St Paul's players - had earned the county's first win in an Ulster Championship match in 18 years four months earlier before taking Derry to a replay in the provincial semi-final.
""2000 caused a big rift with the Cargin players all walking away from the county. Brian White was hugely miffed about it all,"" says McGuckin.
A year later, St Gall's won the first of their remarkable sequence of 13 Antrim titles in 14 years which was only interrupted by Cargin's 2006 final win over Lamh Dhearg.
St Gall's period of dominance, which included landing the Ulster and All-Ireland titles in 2009-10, saw them overcoming Cargin in four Antrim finals before the Toome men had long-awaited revenge by beating the west Belfast club in the 2016 decider, which followed their 2015 triumph over Lamh Dhearg.
re was to be one final instalment in Cargin's rivalry with that great St Gall's team in an 2018 Antrim semi-final as Tomas McCann's last-kick 13th-metre free to the net saw the Toome men snatch a dramatic one-point victory in a moment that became a YouTube hit.
A few weeks later, neighbours Creggan were edged out in a dour and low-scoring final with further triumphs following against Lamh Dhearg, after a replay, and Creggan once more as the Erin's Own clinched their first Antrim three-in-a-row two years ago.
""Cargin is a resilient place and the club is all about the family and the family connection,"" adds McGuckin.
""If I was to name Sunday's team, they would nearly all have connections to previous Cargin teams down through the years.""
majority of the club's players have their secondary education at gaelic football hotbeds St Patrick's Maghera, St Mary's Magherafelt or St Pius' Magherafelt, which McGuckin says has been a crucial factor in Cargin's success.
And the production line seems set to continue as four Cargin boys were part of Kevin Brady's St Mary's Magherafelt squad which won this year's MacRory Cup, with the Erin's Own manager Ronan Devlin able to see the quartet's progress at close quarters given his involvement in Brady's backroom team.
mas McCann was back to his last-ditch heroics in the semi-final a couple of weeks ago against last year's champions Creggan as his point secured a dramatic one-point win which prevented the game going to penalties.
After that game, McCann's first thought was for the family of club stalwart Paddy 'Punk' Devlin, who had passed away that week after a brave and long battle against illness.
Paddy's own son Brian Og is part of the Cargin squad but has been out of action this season because of a dislocated shoulder while his brothers Brian and JC are club stalwarts, with the latter the club's senior manager for a time.
As for Sunday's game at Corrigan Park, Pat Shivers' availability after having his semi-final red card overturned is a boost for Cargin but McGuckin is refusing to having any truck with suggestions that the Erin's Own are racing certainties to win the club's 11th Antrim title.
""I remember going in really hot favourites against Rossa in 1989. Some of the Rossa people made an absolute fortunate because Cargin were completely and utterly unbackable favourites and an old Rossa team beat them handily,"" recalls Geordie.
""There is no complacency about Cargin. We have had the scars of too many defeats,"" he insists.

politics	Is Nicola Sturgeon losing her grip on the SNP?	"f Stephen Flynn as the SNP's Westminster leader has been portrayed by other parties as a blow for the authority of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
Mr Flynn is replacing a close ally of Ms Sturgeon in Ian Blackford, and won a contest against another in Alison Thewliss.
But with the two politicians insisting they will work together towards their shared goal of Scottish independence, has talk of divisions within Scotland's most dominant political force been overstated?
SNP has been quick to dismiss any notion of schisms within the party as ""complete fiction"".
Ms Sturgeon swiftly congratulated Mr Flynn and his deputy Mhairi Black as a ""truly formidable team"", saying she was ""looking forward to working with them both"".
She has also insisted that the move to replace Mr Blackford was ""not a coup"" - but it is a fact that Mr Flynn's name was being linked with moves to replace the Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP in the weeks before he decided to step down.
Mr Flynn initially denied he was planning a leadership bid despite talk of him being ""on manoeuvres"". 
But the Aberdeen South MP has since conceded that something was going on, stating that ""it's not unusual in political parties for people to court the support or opinion of their colleagues"".
me off the back of months of speculation about whether there could be a change, which was so widespread that Boris Johnson used to poke fun at Mr Blackford about it on a weekly basis at prime minister's questions.
Mr Flynn was floated as an alternative who might prove a punchier figure, who would have more of a go at the Westminster establishment - and perhaps, whispered some, the SNP's internal one.
After Mr Blackford announced his departure, Mr Flynn hoped for a coronation - one ally told BBC Scotland they would be ""astonished"" if anyone else ran for the job - and it is understood that the 34-year-old met Ms Sturgeon for talks.
However those hopes were dashed when Alison Thewliss - a Glasgow MP widely seen as being much closer to the first minister - announced she would be running. 
Ms Thewliss stressed her credentials as a ""team player"", saying she would ""work closer and smarter"" with the Scottish government, and ultimately won the backing of 17 MPs to Mr Flynn's 26.
So it may be the case that recent events have not played out in exactly the way either Mr Flynn or Ms Sturgeon might have wanted.
But now that Mr Flynn is in the post, both will be looking forward - because the role of the SNP's Westminster group might be about to become more important than ever before.
Stephen Flynn takes part in his first Prime Minister's Questions
With plans for an independence referendum next year having hit the buffers, the party is looking to use the next general election as a single-issue campaign.
means the constitutional question could be answered not by people voting Yes or No, but by putting a cross in a box next to the name of someone like Stephen Flynn or Alison Thewliss.
MPs like John McNally and Marion Fellows may not have garnered a huge profile in politics to date, but they are going to be on the frontline of what their party hopes will be the decisive contest in its independence campaign.
re have been some rumblings about the strategy already, with high profile MP Angus MacNeil suggesting that a snap Holyrood election might be better suited as a ""de facto referendum"" than a general election would be.
And Ms Black and Stewart McDonald have both sought to talk down some of the rhetoric which flew around about Scotland being ""oppressed"" or a ""colony"" in the wake of November's Supreme Court ruling.
So the key question about Mr Flynn's regime is whether he can pull his group together and get them marching in unison ahead of the next election, which is currently expected in 2024.
Westminster group has always been slightly more restive, being further from Ms Sturgeon's control and lacking a clear purpose as the third party in a parliament all of its members would like to leave.
But there have been rumblings of discontent in the first minister's back yard at Holyrood too.
In October, the SNP suffered its largest ever backbench rebellion over the government's plans to make it easier for people to change their legally recognised gender. 
One minister resigned to vote against the plans, and eight other MSPs broke the whip - accounting for 20% of the party's backbench group.
ue back in parliament in the days before the Christmas break, and there will be a series of further votes on amendments before the big vote whether the bill becomes law.
It is still expected to pass, and ministers hope this will put the issue to bed at least from a parliamentary standpoint.
And it is fair to say that there are not many other issues like gender reform coming up at Holyrood on which SNP members would be likely to rebel en masse.
But there has been criticism on some other fronts too, with SNP members of Holyrood's finance committee hitting out about the lack of detail in financial plans for the National Care Service.
me committee is set to hold an inquiry into ""effective decision-making by government"". 
It's possible this could signal an outbreak of independent thinking from MSPs in a parliament where party whips have been utterly dominant.
Does all of this add up to a real headache for Ms Sturgeon?
It may be more the case that these grumbles are side-effects of the greater question facing the independence movement, as its strategy begins to pivot away from holding a referendum next year.
For the entirety of Ms Sturgeon's record-breaking tenure as first minister, the plan has been to secure and win a referendum.
She has repeatedly predicted that Westminster opposition to indyref2 would prove unsustainable, and would crumble in the face of one more electoral mandate. It has not.
And having pushed a case to the Supreme Court and lost, the SNP leader is now drawing up plans for a de facto referendum - an approach she previously used to write off as a ""unionist trap"" when proposed by opponents within the SNP.
re are a great many questions to be answered about how a de facto referendum would work, and whether it could actually deliver independence with international recognition. 
It may be that this uncertainty is what has sparked questions about Ms Sturgeon's grip on her party too.
She will hold a special party conference in the new year in a bid to settle the issue of process - and if she can do that, it's entirely possibly she will put the wider questions about her authority to bed too.
If the independence movement and its political representatives are focused on the greater prize and feel it is truly close at hand, they will frankly have less time to spend on infighting.
And unlike at Westminster, there does not appear to be any particular challenge to Ms Sturgeon's leadership from ambitious colleagues.
Not only is nobody plotting a move against the first minister, the leadership doesn't seem to have any succession plans of its own in the pipeline. 
re are few obvious signs of a future first minister being groomed within the ministerial team.
So in the next phase of the debate, Ms Sturgeon's position is still assured. But given she is hoping the coming years will answer the constitutional question once and for all, this period will likely prove decisive in terms of her own future too."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63886994
business	US jobs growth solid but slowing amid inflation fight	"Jobs growth in the US is continuing at a solid, though slowing pace, despite rising prices and higher borrowing costs weighing on the economy. 
Employers added 261,000 jobs in October, while the unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.7%, the US Labor Department said on Friday.
ws comes as the economy remains a top concern for voters ahead of next week's midterm elections.
Despite a strong labour market, soaring costs have hit public confidence.
Consumer prices are rising at a pace not seen since the early 1980s. Inflation, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, is up 8.2% over the 12 months to September. 
While the rate has slowed since June as motor fuel prices fall, the cost of groceries, medical bills and many other items continues to climb.
ue has weighed on Democrats, who were already fighting an uphill battle to maintain their slim hold of Congress. 
""People are depressed and often people vote with their pocketbooks,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief US economist at S&P Global Ratings. ""Inflation is almost everywhere. People are squeezed at the checkout stand, they're squeezed with their rental payments, when they try to buy a home.""
White House has made the case that some slowdown is expected - and healthy - as the economy returns to normal after the surge in activity when it reopened from lockdowns.
And for now, government figures suggest there has only been mild softening in the labour market.
Although the unemployment rate ticked up from 3.5% in September, the 261,000 jobs added last month was far better than economists had expected, with healthcare and manufacturing firms helping to drive the hiring. 
Wage gains were also strong, despite not keeping pace with inflation, with average hourly pay up 4.7% over the past year.
""We're going to do what it takes to bring inflation down,"" President Joe Biden said Friday, responding to the latest figures. ""But as long as I'm president, I'm not going to accept an argument that the problem is that too many Americans are finding good jobs. ""
With prices still rising sharply, however, analysts say they expect to see job losses increase next year, as consumers start to curb their spending and the central bank raises interest rates to rein in rising costs.
Since March, when interest rates were hovering near zero, the Federal Reserve has hiked borrowing costs six times, moves that have rippled out to the public in the form of sharply higher rates for home, car and business loans. 
By making borrowing more expensive, the bank hopes to cool demand among businesses and households, in turn easing the pressures pushing up prices.
""The US economy continues to create far more jobs than population growth can accommodate, putting more upward pressure on wages and prices,"" said Ron Temple, head of US Equities at Lazard Asset Management.
""The Fed has attacked the inflation challenge aggressively, but will be forced to remain on the offensive as long as the labour markets remain resilient.""
Some sectors, such as housing and technology, have been hit hard already and anecdotal reports of job cuts and hiring freezes have increased, as firms prepare for a downturn.
On Thursday, payments firm Stripe on Thursday said it was axing 14% of its workforce, while Lyft, a taxi firm that is Uber's main rival, said it was cutting 700 jobs. 
Elon Musk told Twitter staff the company would impose widespread job cuts, and Amazon also said it would halt hiring for corporate positions across the company. 
""We think that 2022 represents the beginning of a different economic climate,"" Stripe executives wrote in an email to staff. ""Our business is fundamentally well-positioned to weather harsh circumstances... however, we do need to match the pace of our investments with the realities around us.""
But the ongoing strength of the labour market has raised hopes that the US may be able to avoid a severe recession.
Dane Brecher helps to run Plastic Crafts, a 40-person family-owned manufacturing company in New York that his grandfather started in 1934. 
usiness has felt the effects of higher interest rates, opting to pay cash when it recently bought new machinery, instead of borrowing as it might have a few months ago.
But it does not have major debts and sales have been steady. While there may be some signs of slowdown, he said he is not worried about a serious downturn.
""If interest rates were a little less, I'm sure we'd be looking to expand more,"" he said. ""We're just going to stay the course... we're in a good place. Unfortunately, I don't know if the rest of the country is, but we're OK."""	/news/business-63507546

sports	Novak Djokovic: Serb lands in Australia after ban overturned	"Novak Djokovic has been welcomed back into Australia almost a year after he was deported over his Covid vaccine status.
Officials confirmed the 21-time Grand Slam champion, 35, had landed in the country for January's Australian Open.
Serb Djokovic, a nine-time Australian Open winner, had an automatic three-year visa ban overturned in November.
""I think that he is going to be again the player to beat,"" said Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley.
Last January, when Djokovic arrived in Australia for the 2022 tournament, Covid cases were skyrocketing and government rules required anyone entering the country to be vaccinated - unless they had a valid medication exemption.
Djokovic, who was detained by the Australian Border Force on entering the country and forced to stay at an immigration hotel, claimed he had obtained a medical exemption to defend his title without being vaccinated because he had recently recovered from Covid-19.
However, after 10 days of legal argument, the government ruled he did not meet the requirements for entry, so his visa was cancelled and he was automatically not allowed to return to Australia until 2025.
Djokovic's detention dominated the headlines in the build-up to the tournament, with crowds gathering outside his hotel campaigning for and against his eventual deportation.
Immigration Minister Andrew Giles - whose government came to power in May - overturned the ban last month and Djokovic said he was ""very happy"" on hearing the news.
xpect a backlash to the player's return and added: ""We welcome him back to Australia.
""I have a great deal of confidence in the Australian public. I have a lot of confidence that the fans will react how we hope they will react."" 
Djokovic, the world number five, said in November he was relieved to be able to return to Melbourne.
""[The] Australian Open has been my most successful Grand Slam,"" he added. ""I made some of the best memories there.
""Of course, I want to go back there, I want to play tennis, do what I do best, hopefully have a great Australian summer.""
Djokovic, who is one Grand Slam title behind Rafael Nadal's record of 22, is scheduled to play in the Adelaide International, beginning Sunday, with the Australian Open starting in Melbourne on 16 January. "	/sport/tennis/64101511
health	Ellie Simmonds: A World Without Dwarfism? - documentary explores views on new drug	"""I'm worried that this drug could be the end of dwarfism altogether,"" says Ellie Simmonds in new BBC documentary, Ellie Simmonds: A World Without Dwarfism?
In the programme, which airs on BBC One on Tuesday 5 April at 21:00 BST, the 27-year-old five-time Paralympic Champion explores a new drug called vosoritide, which has been developed to treat children with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism.
rug is already available in the US and the NHS has run trials for a potential roll-out in the United Kingdom.
Whilst many see the drug as a helpful breakthrough, Simmonds has concerns that it could potentially, ""eradicate dwarfism"". 
""Is it about changing who we are? I'm not a fan of that,"" she says early on in the film.
Simmonds was born with achondroplasia, which stunts growth in arms and legs. She has achieved massive sporting success, including eight Paralympic medals and 14 World Championship gold medals.
""If I wasn't a dwarf, I wouldn't have gone to the Paralympics and made a career as an athlete that way,"" she recently told BBC Sport, ""so I thought, 'gosh, if this drug was around when I was a kid, would I actually be who I am today?'""
Over the course of the documentary, Simmonds meets parents and children in the UK and US who are using vosoritide, in order to explore their motives and experiences. She also meets people with dwarfism who oppose its roll-out. 
After filming the documentary, Simmonds spoke to BBC Sport about how she felt after hearing from all of these different opinions.
""It's great that people have choice,"" she said. However, she added: ""If I had a child, because I knew what it's like having dwarfism, I wouldn't choose the drug.""
rity Restricted Growth Association UK defines achondroplasiaexternal-link as a rare genetic condition that causes poor bone growth, resulting in shortened limbs. The average height of someone with achondroplasia is around four feet.
Most children with achondroplasia are born to average size parents and many live healthy lives. There are some medical complications associated with achondroplasia, however.
As set out by to Great Ormond Street Hospitalexternal-link, infants with achondroplasia often have a curve in the lower spine, that may require a brace and some also develop bow legs, which can be treated with surgery. RGUK lists some more rare associated problems as hearing impairment, breathing problems in young children, hydrocephalus, spinal stenosis, leading to compression of nerves to the limbs.
Vosoritide is designed to improve growth in children with achondroplasia, who have open epiphyses (growth plates), meaning they have the potential to grow. Patients take a daily dose and have regular check-ups.
rug may cause serious side effects including a temporary decrease in blood pressure in some patients.
Last November, vosoritide was approved for use in the US, for children over the age of five and in the EU, for children over two.
A year of injections are reportedexternal-link to cost around $332,000 (Â£240,000).
During the film, Simmonds expresses concern that some parents of children with achondroplasia may want to use the drug irrespective of whether their child suffers any associated health problems.
Simmonds meets others in the dwarfism community who share those concerns, including American couple Joe Stramondo and Leah Smith.
""The assumption is that dwarfism is a problem that needs to be fixed,"" says Joe, in the film, adding, ""largely, the folks in the dwarfism community celebrate our differences"".
In order to get a better idea of why the drug is being trialled, Simmonds meets with Dr Melita Irving, who led the UK trials at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. Simmonds wants to know what the metrics of success are.
""The main thing that we measure is growth,"" Irving explains. ""If your bones are growing, that's because they're responding to the drug.""
As per the European Medicines Agencyexternal-link, from a sample of 121 children aged 5-17, those who received vosoritide grew about 1.57cm more during the one year of treatment than those receiving a placebo. The results also suggested that the improvement in growth is maintained while using the drug. The recommendation is to use injections until the patient is unlikely to grow any further.
As to fears about what implications this may have for the dwarfism community, Irving suggests that the aim is to deal with health complications.
""The intention with trialling this drug is not to eradicate dwarfism,"" she tells Simmonds. 
""Yes, dwarfism is an identity, but I also see achondroplasia as being linked with significant medical problems as well and so, one of the purposes of trialling this drug is to see if we can eradicate those complications, rather than eradicate dwarfism,"" she adds.
In 2019, the Restricted Growth Association UK published a statementexternal-link saying they would ""support any medical advancements that reduce the health complications of people with achondroplasia, avoid surgery, remove chronic pain and allow people to live every aspect of their lives to the fullest.""
However, they also added that they do not view increased height as ""an important outcome"" and that, ""if it is shown that this is the only benefit of vosoritide and there is no reduction in the health complications,"" they would no longer support the development of the drug.
During the film, Simmonds meets some of those involved in the NHS trial.
One of those children is 10-year-old Talia. Since taking the medication, she has grown six centimetres in 12 months, which is two centimetres more than the average for a child her age with dwarfism.
Her mother Rocana cites different reasons for participating, including that increased limb length allows her daughter to perform tasks like running or catching more easily. She also speaks about health problems that Talia faced earlier in life, including bowed legs, spinal problems and sleep apnoea.
In California, Simmonds meets the Haider family, who enrolled on the US trial of vosoritide and are strong advocates. Ahmin, 12, who has used the drug for three years, describes why he wants to continue.
""I'm satisfied with who I am, but I want to be better,"" he tells Simmonds. ""Being taller will give me opportunities, it will make my life easier, it would put me on a level playing field with more people,"" he adds.
majority of children with achondroplasia are born to average height parents and one of the delicate questions the film navigates is around those parents making decisions on behalf of their children.
""When they've been living every day as average height parents, they don't know what it's actually like to live with dwarfism,"" Simmonds said. 
However, she did also say that it had to be down to the legal guardians to make these calls.
For Simmonds, it is important to show that dwarfism is not something that needs to be ""cured"".
""As a dwarfism community, we have a role to play when it comes to parents who are nervous and unsure about what their child's life is going to be like. We need to show people that it's not all doom and gloom.""
Simmonds told BBC Sport that she has always felt happy with her own body. From a very young age, she has been involved in sport.
""I went to my first World Championships in 2006, when I was 12; the Beijing 2008 Olympics when I was 13; at London 2012, I was 17,"" she said. 
""I was at peak performance. My body was my tool - it was something that won me gold medals, so I never saw it in a negative way.""
However, she appreciates that not everyone has had such a happy experience.
One of the challenging scenes in the film is when Simmonds chats to her team-mate Will Perry, who also has achondroplasia. 
Perry has spoken publicly about the abuse he has received because of his dwarfism.
He admits that there are times when he wishes he was average height.
""I always get asked the question, 'if you could swap to be a normal person, would you?',"" he tells Simmonds.
""For me, it's 50/50. When we're out at the Paralympics, collecting amazing experiences, you go, 'no, not for the world', but then, when you get in the situations I've been campaigning for more recently, when you have to miss out on things like team sports such as rugby and football, it makes you think, 'actually I really wish I was normal'.""
Simmonds says that it's been eye-opening to speak to people with different experiences.
""I feel very lucky that I haven't really gone through that because of who I am.""
Vosoritide is awaiting National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approval in the UK.
On the NICE websiteexternal-link, it says: ""The scoping exercise will be rescheduled to take place at a later date in 2023.""
When asked what she would like for people to take away from watching the film, Simmonds replied: ""I want people to see that, yes, society is different and that's amazing. Let's embrace that. Don't treat anyone differently - we're all human beings."""	/sport/swimming/60934176

technology	BGMI: Why India has blocked the popular combat mobile game	"A popular combat and survival game similar to hit video game PlayerUnknown's Battleground (PUBG) has been blocked in India.
Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) has been taken off the Google and Apple app stores. 
Google said it had blocked access to the game in the country after receiving a government order.
Developer Krafton confirmed the news and said it was talking to authorities to understand why it was suspended.
BGMI is a rebranded avatar of PUBG, which was among a slew of Chinese-origin apps blocked by the Indian government in 2020.
2020 took place against the backdrop of tensions between the two countries along a disputed Himalayan border.
In several phases throughout the year, India banned apps like WeChat Work and TikTok, that had Chinese links.
""The government had banned these apps citing security concerns, data of Indian citizens going out etc, but it was essentially meant to put pressure on China over the border conflict,"" says tech analyst Prasanto K Roy.
PUBG was developed by a subsidiary of the South Korean company, Krafton, and operated in India through Tencent Games, a division of the Chinese multinational Tencent Holdings.
mpany cut ties with Tencent in India and released BGMI in 2021. A year after its launch, the Krafton said the game had 100 million registered users in India. 
In June, PUBG made headlines again after a 16-year-old boy in Lucknow city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh allegedly shot his mother dead for scolding him about playing the game.
renewed a debate about the violence in such games and also came up in the ongoing session of the parliament.
In response to an MP's question about such apps, the government said it was looking into reports of rebranded and similar sounding apps.
urrent BGMI ban links itself back to the Chinese apps ban, says Mr Roy.
""Since 2020, the government had added a further layer of scrutiny to funding sources which come from a country with which India shares a land border,"" he says. ""It has also been looking harder and harder at apps with Chinese origin.""
r, the government and the Reserve Bank of India have been cracking down on lending-related apps. ""These apps are not regulated and triggered genuine issues but the scrutiny has essentially to do with the concerns with China,"" he says.
While BGMI is published by the South Korea's Krafton, China's Tencent Holdings has a 13.6% stake in the company through its subsidiary Image Frame Investment.
Under intense government scrutiny, Mr Roy says, apps that are Chinese-owned or have significant Chinese investment will continue to find it extremely difficult to operate in India."	/news/world-asia-india-62344926
business	Cardiff company offers unlimited holidays to reward staff	"A production company has introduced ""unlimited"" annual leave in a bid to reward staff and maximise productivity. 
Big companies such as Netflix, LinkedIn and Goldman Sachs have introduced some unlimited paid holiday leave in recent years. 
Cardiff-based EatSleep Media, which has 13 staff, said it was about ""giving power back"" to them.
An expert said empowering employees improved morale, but clear expectations were necessary. 
EatSleep, which makes documentaries, podcasts and online videos, said it asked its team to work ""very flexibly"", including on evenings, weekends and sometimes abroad. 
Co-founder Alex Feeney said: ""We ask a lot of them, and there are some long days in there, so to not offer some flexibility in return didn't seem quite right.""
He said they always told new staff ""we're not here to parent them"" and that they want employees to be treated like adults in their work.  
""So, if we're empowering them to do that, why wouldn't we do that with other aspects of the work-life balance?"" he said. 
He added when staff came to the end of a big project they could be a bit ""fried"" and the firm didn't want them to worry about whether they could then book time off or whether they needed to save annual leave. 
Mr Feeney said it was about ""giving power back to our team"" based on their needs and ""where the company is at the time"". 
""We want people to be able to go: 'Do you know what - I'm going to take that day, because I deserve it'. Or 'I'm going to take that day I feel a bit fried', or 'I'm going to take that week because I've looked at the workflow and things are a bit quiet'.""
He said it also ""simplified the process"" for the company, as they no longer needed to keep track of things like time in lieu. 
Unlimited paid time off (UPTO) originated at small Silicon Valley start-ups and has become much more common in recent years. 
But the concept is still quite rare, with data from a 2021 survey suggesting just 4% of US companies offer it.
And what sounds like a boundless benefit does often come with caveats. 
Mr Feeney said no-one at EatSleep had yet booked off a longer period of leave, such as a month to three months, and while such a large single block wasn't ""beyond the bounds of possibility"" it would need to be considered against the needs of the company. 
Prof Michael Christie, of Aberystwyth University's Business School, said UPTO was not ""more widespread"" at the moment, but was part of a broader movement towards more flexible working practices post Covid. 
""If employers start reducing the constraints of defined working hours - so rather than saying you have to work nine to five, five days a week - by being more flexible, that allows employees to manage their commitments,"" he said. 
""Empowering employees also improves morale. You don't feel like you're being told to do X, Y and Z - and it allows people to take control of their situations.""
While the idea has been embraced by some businesses, others have experimented with UPTO, only to end the policy and revert to original holiday arrangements.
A 2018 survey showed workers with UPTO took fewer holidays than those with a fixed allocation. 
Prof Christie said there was evidence employees often don't take enough holiday with UPTO and it was necessary for a minimum amount of leave to be set. 
He said there also needed to be ""a clearly defined expectation"" in a UPTO workplace around the practical limits of how much leave someone could actually take against a company's demands. 
""As an employer, you need to make sure your employees are aware of their commitments to that firm,"" he said. 
Mr Feeney said there had been a range of responses to the scheme at EatSleep from people outside the company, including some asking for a job and others dismissing it as part of ""snowflake culture"". 
He added the company's research of others who tried and failed with UPTO had found some workers felt ""obliged not to take time off"" because co-workers had not. 
Mr Feeney said: ""It's like a reverse psychology effect and we're really aware of that. We really want people to take that holiday because we appreciate that they come back refreshed, recharged and ready for the next project.""
He said they had set a lower limit of leave and that in some cases they'd tell people to take leave if they hadn't booked any.
Mr Feeney said it was important for every company to do what worked for them and UPTO wouldn't fit with every business. "	/news/uk-wales-62671704

politics	Ukrainian refugees told to leave hotel next month	"One of almost 60 Ukrainian refugees who have been told they have a month to leave a Perthshire hotel says she hopes to be able to stay in the area.
Nataliia Parkhomenko has been living in the Killin Hotel since July and expected to be there until February.
refugees have now been told that they will have to leave their temporary accommodation next month.
Scottish government said it was doing what it could to accommodate people wishing to stay in Killin.
Its minister for refugees from Ukraine said it was constantly reviewing its temporary accommodation provision and did not expect people to be rebuilding their lives from hotels.
Nataliia has worked in a local cafe near the hotel for two months and said she felt at home in the area.
She told BBC Scotland's The Nine: ""I don't feel like a refugee here. 
""It's really good because people here try to help a lot with, for example, to find a place to work, or to help with English classes."" 
Nataliia said she was surprised when she was told the refugees would have to relocate.
""We built our plans according to this schedule,"" she said. ""But I understand the hotel where we live, it's like temporary accommodation for us. 
""So we will be happy with any other place the government will give us to live.""
Nataliia works with three other Ukrainians at the Real Food Cafe in Killin.
Owner Sarah Heward said she was devastated at the prospect of potentially losing them.
She said: ""This is real, this is people's lives. It's people's livelihoods.""
refugees came to Scotland under the super sponsor scheme.
Neil Gray, the Scottish government's minister for refugees from Ukraine, said hotels by their nature were temporary accommodation.
He said the government wanted the refugees to be in long-term, sustainable accommodation.
He added: ""A lot of people had contacted us wanting to move into a more central location
""We don't expect people to be building their lives from hotel accommodation. We're also wanting to give people choice over where they are staying. 
""So for some people in Killin, they want to be closer to Stirling. 
""We understand that and we'll do what we can to offer that opportunity.
""For those that are keen to stay in Killin, we're working with the hotel and Stirling Council to ensure that we can offer people that choice.""
A Stirling Council spokesperson said: ""We are continuing to work with guests to support moves from temporary accommodation, based on their individual needs."""	/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-63413097
business	People cut back on food, fuel and clothes as prices rise, BBC survey suggests	"People struggling with the soaring cost of living are cutting back on food and car journeys to save money, according to a BBC-commissioned survey.
More than half (56%) the 4,011 people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals.
findings reveal the widespread impact of prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. 
Many people have cut spending on clothes and socialising. Some say their mental health has been affected.
wo-thirds of those surveyed also suggested government support provided so far was insufficient.
BBC-commissioned survey of 4,011 UK adults in early June lifts a lid on how the economic climate is affecting lives and financial, physical and mental health.
f domestic energy, petrol, and food have all increased significantly in recent months, and the findings suggest more than eight in 10 people (81%) are worried about the rising cost of living.
Concern has grown since the start of the year when 69% of those asked said they were worried in a similar BBC survey.
In the latest results, two thirds (66%) of those with worries said this was having a negative effect on their mental health. Nearly half (45%) said their physical health had been affected.
Day-to-day, individuals are making further changes to manage their budgets. The survey suggests this can be as simple as going on fewer nights out, or getting a haircut less often.
For charity worker Janine Colwill, from Easington, and those she talks to, the changes have been more fundamental.
""We get together with the family every Sunday, religiously, for Sunday roast - but my family and other families are starting to grow their own vegetables,"" she said.
""Those people who may not have worried about these things before are now worrying about them constantly.
""With advances in technology, I never would have thought that people would be relying on a food bank or growing their own - and just penny-pinching,"" she said.
urvey suggests people are finding various ways to manage and save their money. The findings include: 
About half (52%) expect to work more hours in the next six months to help to pay the bills.
, the UK's largest supermarket, said in a trading update for the three months to 28 May that it was seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to inflation, such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. 
Chief executive Ken Murphy also said people are switching to cheaper own-label brands for goods including bread and pasta which have seen prices soar due to the war between Ukraine and Russia, both of which are major wheat exporters.  
Prices, as measured by inflation, are rising at a rate of 9% a year, the fastest for 40 years. Interest rates, which also affect the cost of living, were increased to 1.25% on Thursday by the Bank of England - the highest they have been for 13 years.
uation is being driven, to a significant degree, by global factors such as the cost of oil, gas and food. 
But there are UK-specific issues which are adding to inflation such as the tight labour market. Job vacancies are at a record high of 1.3 million meaning employers face paying higher wages to fill roles. 
Also, the UK's dominant services sector - which includes the likes of accountancy and law firms, as well as restaurants and pubs - is seeing price rises. 
Drivers now have to spend Â£103 for petrol and Â£106 for diesel to fill a family car, according to the RAC. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) has predicted food prices will rise at a rate of 15% this summer as households pay more for staples such as bread, meat, dairy and fruit and vegetables.
A typical household in England, Wales and Scotland is likely to see a rise in its annual domestic gas and electricity bill of Â£800 in October, on top of a Â£700 rise in April.
urge in inflation is hitting wide and hitting deep, with the effects leading to significant changes in the way lives are being lived well beyond those on low incomes. 
Large swathes of Britain's middle income working households are having to make material cutbacks and even after that are part of a new class of those ""just about managing"".  
In practice this has meant energy bill direct debits wiping out people's entire disposable income, some food banks running out of food donations, or their donors becoming users. 
And it may be changing attitudes, with nearly two-thirds of those asked saying even after the recent package of support for energy bills from the government, that it is not enough. And the numbers suggest a similar proportion think the support in place needs to last at least a year longer.
Inflation this high certainly changes the economy and our spending behaviour. 
But the figures raise a question about whether the high levels of government support in the pandemic and in this energy crisis too, are now becoming baked into public expectations.
Soaring prices have led the government to announce a package of financial support directed primarily at those on low incomes. This includes a Â£400 discount on all energy bills in October, in addition to payments totalling Â£650 to people on means-tested benefits. Pensioners will get more this winter, as will billpayers with disabilities.
However, the BBC survey reveals that 64% of those asked said this support was insufficient to help people with the rising cost of living.
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said vulnerable households would receive Â£1,200 which he said was part of a ""very large"" amount of support, on top of what had already been provided.
He said the first payments would come in July, and would continue into the autumn to offset the key driver of the rising cost of living for households, which was energy bills.
""That, of course, is yet to filter through to people, which is why I suspect people are saying they want more support,"" he told the BBC.
""As this gathers pace, it will be clear to people that this will be a comprehensive package.""
mpact of rising household costs has already led to the financial regulator warning lenders that they need to do more to help those in financial difficulty and support vulnerable customers.
""Early action is important for those struggling with debt,"" said Sheldon Mills, of the Financial Conduct Authority."	/news/business-61813857

sports	Ona Carbonell wants her story to show 'it's possible to be a mother and an athlete'	"When Ona Carbonell was told she could not breastfeed her son at the Tokyo Olympics, she felt she was being made to choose between her family and her sporting career.
Artistic swimmer Carbonell, 31, is a three-time Olympian and has won more than 30 major medals.
In August 2020 she gave birth to her first child - Kai - and was advised by doctors to take six months off training. She was back within four weeks, and within 11 months was ready to compete at the Olympics.
We spoke to Carbonell recently, as a film documenting her journey from giving birth to competing in Tokyo launched on Rakuten TV.
""I hope my story shows other women it's possible to be a mother and an athlete,"" she says. ""It's a wonderful thing.""
film - called Starting Over - is a study in the serious sacrifices needed to juggle elite sport and motherhood. At times we see Carbonell crying in her car - too tired to drive home from training and thinking of giving up.
""I am incredibly exhausted and I'm feeling a lot of pressure,"" she says. ""I get home and I don't even have the energy to pick Kai up.""
Of course, this was all happening during a global pandemic too, meaning training on Zoom and plans thrown into disarray by competitions being rescheduled.
As a breastfeeding mother, among the practical impacts on Carbonell was the fact her pattern of pumping milk for Kai was disrupted.
She speaks in the film about how exhausting that can be, but says that if she doesn't do it she will feel sore and swollen.
rough it all, her drive to compete at another Olympics is clear - but the challenges don't let up.
As part of the Games' Covid-19 safety protocols, organisers initially banned athletes' families attending.
Several athletes raised the issue of breastfeeding mothers, including Canadian basketball player Kim Gaucher, who won an appealexternal-link to take her baby to Tokyo. She called it ""the right decision for women in sports.""
But even after the rules were changed - with Tokyo 2020 organisers saying ""nursing children"" could travel to Tokyo ""when necessary"" - Carbonell had an incredibly tough decision to make.
She said: ""The Olympics told me I could bring my son, but he would have to stay in a separate place.
""That would have meant that every time I had to breastfeed my son, I would have to break the Olympic bubble - possibly putting myself, my son and the whole team at risk."" 
Carbonell said she understood the Covid pandemic meant caution was needed, but that she shouldn't have had to make the decision to leave Kai at home.
""If it's possible to bring your coach, it should be possible to bring your husband or a parent along with your baby,"" she says.
When Carbonell returned from the Games, Kai no longer breastfed.
""I didn't think this would end like this and wanted to continue for more time,"" she says. ""But that's one of the great obstacles for a female athlete and hopefully this will change in the coming years.""
Carbonell believes the issue goes beyond the pandemic and says she has never seen a woman breastfeeding a baby in an Olympic village.
She also says athletes can be discouraged from starting families, and that ""being pregnant is worse than being injured"".
So what does Carbonell think could be done to make things easier?
""It would be good if there were more rooms for mothers to breastfeed in,"" she says.
""We also need more information for new mothers. I'm pregnant at the moment with my second child and I'm still training, but it's very confusing to figure out what we can and cannot do."" 
For now, Carbonell is hoping her story can show other female athletes that motherhood can be compatible with sport - given the right environment and support.
""Some of my team-mates decided to postpone being mothers and, in the end, it was too late for them,"" she says. 
""It's not necessary."""	/sport/swimming/60595455
health	Parents urged to get children flu vaccine as infections rise	"Parents are being urged to get their children a flu vaccine after a 70% jump in hospitalisations of patients under five.
UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said an 11% fall in vaccine uptake among two and three-year-olds came as flu circulated at higher levels.
All children in this age group can get vaccinated at their GP surgery.
wo doctors from Bristol said their son getting ill with the flu was ""every parent's worst nightmare"".
Covid restrictions have meant most young children have never encountered flu and have no natural immunity to the virus, the UKHSA said.
reased risk has coincided with the uptake of the flu vaccine among two-year-olds standing at 31% and 33% among three-year-olds.
figures are down by around 11% compared to the past two years, the UKHSA said.
Anjali and Ben Wildblood from Bristol saw their two-year-old son Rafa become ""very sick"" with flu just days before he was due to have the vaccine.
r, who are both NHS consultants, said their concerns prompted them to take him to A&E where he was treated and sent home.
""But his condition got worse again, with a soaring temperature and exhaustion - he had no strength whatsoever and what was so extremely worrying was that he barely had the strength to breathe - every parent's worst nightmare,"" they said.
After returning to hospital, Rafa was admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit where he was put under general anaesthetic and intubated.
His swab results came back showing he had influenza type A and after two days in the unit he gradually began to improve.
He is now home and doing well.
""No parent wants this for their child or to go through a similar terrible experience.
""We urge other parents of two to three-year-olds to ensure your child gets their flu vaccine as soon as possible,"" his parents said.
Dr Conall Watson, consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: ""Young children are particularly vulnerable to becoming very poorly from flu.
""For the third week running we have seen hospitalisation rates among children under five jump up, with a 70% increase in just the last week.""
Parents are encouraged to contact their GP if they have not received an invite for a nasal spray vaccination for a child aged two or three as of 31 August.
All primary school children and some secondary school children are also eligible for the flu nasal spray this year, which is usually given in school.

entertainment	Love Actually director Richard Curtis uncomfortable with movie's lack of diversity	"Love Actually director Richard Curtis has said he feels ""a bit stupid"" about parts of his 2003 Christmas rom-com, including its lack of diversity.
Curtis admitted elements of the movie are now ""bound to feel out of date"".
British filmmaker added that many people's ongoing love for his film was ""really touching"", however.
Curtis made the remarks on The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later, a one-hour special broadcast on US TV channel ABC.
He appeared on the programme alongside stars Hugh Grant, Dame Emma Thompson and Bill Nighy, as well as Laura Linney and Thomas Brodie-Sangster.
Asked by anchor Diane Sawyer if there were any elements of the film that ""made you wince"", Curtis replied: ""There are things that you would change, but thank God society is changing.
""My film is bound in some moments to feel out of date,"" he said. ""The lack of diversity makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit stupid.
""There is such extraordinary love that goes on every minute in so many ways [in life generally], all the way around the world, and makes me wish my film was better.
""It makes me wish I'd made a documentary just to kind of observe it.""
He later added how films, when done well, can ""act as a reminder of how lovely things can be and how there are all sorts of things which we might pass by, which are in fact the best moments in our lives"".
r-studded Love Actually pulls together a string of separate but inter-linked romantic tales into one festive feast, which many viewers continue to devour to this day, while others find it sickly and in parts problematic and sexist.
x office smash hit received two Golden Globe awards as well as rather mixed reviews from critics.
At the time, Variety's Todd McCarthy called it ""a roundly entertaining romantic comedy"" and a ""doggedly cheery confection"", while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times labelled it as ""a belly-flop into the sea of romantic comedy"".
In a retrospective review, BBC Culture's Nicholas Barber noted how ""there's actually no love in Love Actually"", suggesting ""Lust Actually"" might have been a better title.
During the aforementioned ABC show, some of its stars praised Curtis, with Dame Emma describing the Comic Relief co-creator as a man with a ""golden heart"".
""He's truly a good person [and] in our business that's something that [is] to be treasured.""
Grant added that the Love Actually script is ""a bit psychotic"", or in other words: ""Richard on steroids"".
""But the thing is with him, what you have to remember is when he writes about love, he means it,"" said Grant. ""And that is quite rare.
""I did drunkenly watch a bit of Love Actually a few months ago with my wife, and she was the one who said, 'Oh look, it's all about pain, it's all about suffering'.""
Love Actually cast reunites for Comic Relief
Nighy, who won a Bafta for best actor in a supporting role for his contribution in the film, said it was ""wonderful to be a part of"". 
""It's amazing the way it's entered the language,"" he said.
""I have people coming up to me saying it got me through my chemotherapy, or it got me through my divorce, or I watch it whenever I'm alone. And people do it.""
Elsewhere on the programme, Nighy's co-star Grant, who portrayed a fictional UK prime minister in Love Actually, said his famous Downing Street dance is ""the most excruciating scene ever committed to celluloid"".
In the scene he is seen gyrating around the offices of Number 10 Girls Aloud's version of The Pointer Sisters' 1983 track Jump, before being caught by his personal secretary.
Down the years, many people have recreated the dance online, such as former WBO heavyweight champion Joseph Parker.
Boxer Joseph Parker recreates Love Actually dance routine at home
""I think I saw it in the script and thought 'I'll hate doing that',"" recalled Grant. ""No Englishman can dance when they're sober at 8am in the morning,"" he joked.
""And to this day, you know, there's many people, and I agree with them, and we think it's the most excruciating scene ever committed to celluloid.
""But then some people like it.""
Director Curtis said the actor - who he also cast in Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill - had been ""grumpy"" about performing the routine, but went through with it due to ""contractual obligation""."	/news/entertainment-arts-63805817
health	Christmas: The theatre group bringing joy to care homes	"A theatre company has been bringing festive cheer to care homes across Northern Ireland with a series of performances specially created for people living with dementia.
Commedia of Errors' nostalgia-filled Christmas shows feature classic songs and poetry.
For many care homes, it has marked the return to face-to-face performances after the Covid-19 pandemic.
""It is such a joy to be part of,"" said theatre-maker Benjamin Gould.
uring variety show, called Plays Aloud, has been visiting people in care homes and dementia care units across Northern Ireland.
Directed by Clare McMahon and Benjamin Gould, the shows have been funded by Arts Council Northern Ireland and Halifax Foundation NI.
""We have developed over the years a more specialised style of performance,"" said Mr Gould.
""It focuses on engagement so a lot of it is to do with encouraging the audience to sing and recite poetry with us. 
""It's not just about standing there performing. It's about sharing the experience with the residents and it has a little bit more of a communal feel to it.""
Mr Gould said he can see the mood of residents ""changing dramatically"" during performances.
""If you go in and somebody's having a bad day, they are not really happy and engaging but you hit on the right song and suddenly you see them light up and they'll start singing along and they'll start dancing and that positive mood will carry on maybe even days after we've left,"" he said.
""Because memory can be so intrinsically linked to music and poetry you could have somebody who is not verbal before you come in and if you hit on the right song or the right piece of poetry, they'll start reciting along with you, start singing along with you and they'll actually be able to hold a conversation with you as well.
""It's a lonely place if you're not able to engage and if you get to do that then it becomes much more positive for them.""
Christmas tour features four performers working in groups of two to ensure the group can pay a visit to a care home in every county of Northern Ireland.
""It's beautiful sometimes,"" said performer Rosie McClelland.
""There was a time when a lady, who hadn't really spoken for a while, started to recite every single word of a poem because she had learnt it at primary school.
""It's wonderful how those core memories still exist and that's why we want to bring the core memories and give them that nostalgia feeling.""
Performer Adam Dougal said it was a privilege to be part of the show.
""I think music is a very powerful thing and it can evoke memories - we all associate a certain song with a time in our life,"" he said.
""It can be very moving. What we're trying to do is have a connection with that audience because we're in a very intimate environment.
""It can be very emotional and it can be very uplifting as well.
""Sometimes family members are there and for them to witness their relative, their mum or dad, enjoying themselves, coming out of their shells, can be a really special thing and quite moving.""
Fiona McAnespie, from Radius Housing, said she has seen a positive impact on residents, and their families.
""Some of our residents would be limited in communication due to their dementia but they'll be citing poetry or singing along,"" she said.
""I have seen relatives in tears because they maybe haven't heard their mum or dad speak or react for a long time."" 
She said people living with dementia can often retain long-term memories, which is why the old songs and poetry used in the performances can have such an impact.
""We obviously can see that it brings back a memory to them and for some it may be something that was played on their wedding day or something they recited at school,"" she said.
""The reaction is really quite phenomenal when you see it."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64024395
health	Strep A links investigated after child's death in Powys	"Links with the invasive group A streptococcal disease (iGAS) are being investigated after the death of a child in Powys, health experts have said.
Public Health Wales is working with local health officials and the council following a possible link to a ""very rare complication"" of the disease.
PHW's Dr Ardiana Gjini said people ""identified for public health action have already been contacted"".
""We remind parents to be vigilant for signs and symptoms,"" she said.
Most often, symptoms are mild - a sore throat or a skin infection that can be easily treated with antibiotics.
But strep A can cause a range of symptoms and one is scarlet fever, which mostly affects young children and, again, needs antibiotics.
Very rarely, strep A can also cause invasive group A streptococcal infection or iGAS which happens when the bacteria gets past the body's immune defences.
NHS Wales' 111 phone service took more than 18,000 calls on the weekend - more than double that of the same period last year - amid concern about strep A symptoms.
re have been 15 confirmed deaths of children with strep A since September, including Hanna Roap, seven, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan.
Her father, Hasan Roap, 37, has previously told BBC Wales how his family had been ""traumatised"" and ""devastated"" by her death within 24 hours of being taken ill.
Dr Gjini, a consultant in communicable disease control, said: ""While we understand that parents are likely to be worried, cases of invasive group A streptococcal infection (iGAS) remain rare in Wales, and children have a very low risk of contracting the disease.""
PHW has made a symptom checker for parents with a traffic light system to help them decide when to get medical help.
Referring to the child's death in Powys, Dr Gjini said: ""We offer our deepest condolences to the family, friends and all those affected.  
""A multi-agency incident management team is following normal processes, and investigating links to invasive group A streptococcal disease (iGAS), a very rare complication of group A streptococcal infection.
""People identified for public health action have already been contacted and provided with appropriate treatment and advice.
""Individuals who have not been contacted do not need to take any specific action.

business	Cost of living: Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward	"Ministers are facing growing calls to bring forward large increases in benefits and the state pension which will be paid from next April.
Charities want benefits to increase now to help people struggling with the cost of living, particularly energy bills.
A well-established system means the annual increase in benefits will match this September's inflation rate - but will only be paid from April 2023.
reasury says there are technical constraints in making earlier payments.
Debt charity Stepchange said the government needed to address the shortfall between people's costs and their incomes. 
Richard Lane, from the charity, said: ""While we don't doubt that policymakers are aware of the problem, at present the measures being taken to plug the gap are simply not sufficient to help many households avoid incurring debt as a result of the rising cost of living.""
Last month, Citizens Advice called on ministers to increase benefits in line with the current rate of inflation. 
State benefits including universal credit, older benefits such as disability support and jobseeker's allowance, and the state pension increase once a year, in April, to match the rising cost of living.
re pegged to the inflation rate the previous September, although the state pension can also be linked to higher earnings or 2.5% - known as the triple lock.
Benefits and the state pension went up by 3.1% in April this year, to match the inflation rate in September 2021.
At present, that is some way behind the rate at which prices are rising, which was at a 40-year high of 9% in April according to the latest official figures.
Forecasts suggest the rate of price rises could climb by this September. In turn, that would mean a rise in benefits and the state pension of close to 10% in April 2023.
In reality, people are paying higher prices for things now, but will receive higher benefits later.
""Intervention is urgently needed to catch people before they fall into crisis in the months to come because our social security system should be able to provide the protection to weather this storm,"" said Michael Clarke, head of information programmes at the charity Turn2us.
""The government must act as a matter of priority and ensure that as a minimum, benefit levels are increased to meet the true cost of living and they assess their own practices of benefit deductions so that money is not taken away from people at a time where they need it most.""
Economists at leading think tanks said there would be little effect on the public finances - and the Â£250bn welfare bill - if the Treasury decided to bring forward some or all of that increase.
""There is pressure on the government to fast-track the rise,"" said Robert Joyce, deputy director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic research group. ""There has been a reluctance to do something so far.""
Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said that keeping people waiting until next April was ""a recipe for more debt"".
""The main thing is the need to provide more support for those highly reliant on benefits,"" he said. 
He said some people on the state pension would be among the most vulnerable to rising energy bills in the coming winter.
Pensioners Mike Gibbons 75 and his wife Ev, 72 have six daughters between them but the rising cost fuel makes visiting them very expensive. 
At the same time, the Southampton-based couple are grappling with an Â£88 monthly rise in energy bills after their provider PurePlanet went bust and they moved to Shell.
Mr Gibbons says that each 450-500 mile trip to see some of their family in Newcastle-under-Lyme now costs Â£25 more in petrol.
Mrs Gibbons said: ""It's making it more difficult to see our family on a regular basis because you just can't afford it anymore the money's not there. We just can't see our children as much as we'd like to.""
Imran Hussain, director of policy and campaigns at charity Action for Children, said that ""more and more families are starting to run out of road as they face inflation at its highest level in a generation, spiralling energy bills set to rise further and an entirely inadequate benefits system"".
He said: ""They need help with meeting basic living costs now, not warm words hinting at action in the future.""
re are no plans in the Treasury to increase benefits or the state pension before next April.
One of the key reasons for that, according to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is that the welfare systems involved made it technically difficult to change the uprating and paying of older benefits before April.
It is possible to alter universal credit payments relatively quickly, as was done during the pandemic. Other payments such as disability support could take months to change.
Mr Joyce said that IT issues were no excuse for inaction. 
""Even if they need a few months' notice, that is better than waiting another year,"" he said.
Mr Handscomb, from the Resolution Foundation - which focuses on people on lower incomes, said: ""If they get started now, they can do it before the next energy price rise in October.""
He said that the benefits system was the best way to get money to those who needed it but, even if that proved impossible, there were other ways to help people out. This targeted support could include paying more to aid people to pay their energy bills.

sports	Rocky Fielding misses weight for British and Commonwealth light-heavyweight title bout	"Rocky Fielding has missed the weight for his British and Commonwealth light-heavyweight championship bout against Dan Azeez.
Fielding, 35, weighed in a pound over the 175lbs limit but the fight will still go ahead in Bournemouth.
Azeez can add the Commonwealth belt to the British title he already holds, but Fielding cannot win either title.
""I don't read too much into the weight. It is what it is,"" Azeez said of his opponent's failure to make weight.
""Whether he comes over the weight, under the weight, we've still got Saturday night to deal with and that's what I'm focused on.""
fight in Bournemouth is part of the card headlined by hometown fighter Chris Billam-Smith's cruiserweight bout against Kosovo's Armend Xhoxhaj.
Were Fielding to win on Saturday, Azeez would remain the British champion and the Commonwealth title would stay vacant.
Azeez, 33, faces his toughest test to date in the form of former WBA (Regular) super-middleweight champion Fielding.
Fielding is 30-2 in his career, with his only defeats against then-world champions Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Callum Smith at super-middleweight.
Azeez is undefeated in 17 fights and has slowly made a name for himself in the division since dismantling Hosea Burton in November 2021."	/sport/boxing/63988054
entertainment	Nandi Bushell releases debut single written to 'cheer up Dad'	"A schoolgirl who has performed with some of the world's biggest rock stars has released a new single inspired by her dad's health struggles.
Nandi Bushell, 12, of Ipswich, Suffolk, has bookended this month by drumming at the Foo Fighters' Taylor Hawkins memorial gig and launching her track. 
multi-instrumentalist has also won the attention of Barack Obama and tech giant Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
Nandi said: ""I wrote a song to cheer [my dad] up.""
mpanying video to The Shadows, released on 30 September, charts Nandi's journey from toying around with instruments in her former South African home as a toddler to playing guitars and drums with her dad, with current studio footage of her playing a grand piano.
Quick Q&A with drumming star Nandi Bushell
""The single is about how my dad went through depression... because his auto-immune disease was worsening,"" said Nandi. 
""He told me and he was really upset so I made a song about it.""
Mr Bushell said he felt Nandi's song had ""genuinely helped him"" and hoped it would have the same impact on other people.
""I was having flare-ups all over my body and I was feeling really, really terrible,"" he said.
""Nandi was asking me questions and I was describing how I felt trapped in the bed and in my room, and she said how she wanted to do something to cheer me up. I said all my rainbows felt like they were turning to black. 
""She said, 'Let me put these words into the song,' and finished it by saying, 'I'll be there for you'. I thought this is incredible, [it was] such a beautiful moment.""
r hope the track will reach a wide audience, fuelled in part by Nandi's 2.5m social media followers, a forthcoming appearance on children's TV programme Blue Peter this Monday and her meeting this week with Apple chief Mr Cook.
Her profile has been boosted following a string of extraordinary events including performing with Lenny Kravitz, appearing on US talk show Ellen and writing a song in 2021 with ex-Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and his son Roman, which former US President Barack Obama posted on his Facebook page.
However, it is her enduring link-up with Foo Fighters that has continued to make headlines after she challenged frontman Dave Grohl to a drum battle during one of the coronavirus lockdowns. It led him to write Nandi a song and he invited her to perform with them at The Forum in Los Angeles last year.
It was there that the band's drummer Taylor Hawkins, who died aged 50 earlier this year, gave the young prodigy his drumsticks.
Poignantly, Nandi used them during her performance for Learn to Fly at his Wembley Stadium tribute gig.
""There was this balcony where I could see the gig happening - it was emotional,"" said Nandi.
She said appearing at both gigs, along with playing at the Queen's Platinum Jubilee concert where she cried after meeting her hero Stephen Fry, had been the highlights of her life so far.
But for now her sights are set on her single release and her forthcoming EP, Into The Abyss, released later this year.
""If one person who is going through a difficult time listens to that song and decides to reach out for help, then that is a measure of success,"" said Mr Bushell.

Highlights of the exhibition, set up by the Harley Foundation, include a Michelangelo painting - Madonna of Silence - and the pearl earring worn by King Charles I at his execution after the English Civil War.
Parts of the collection are being recalled from loans to museums around the country to make up the exhibition but organisers said many items had never been on display before.
Director of The Harley Foundation Lisa Gee described the collection as ""world class"" - particularly the portraits.
She said: ""Historic portraits were almost always flattering, filtered images which are like the social media of their day but behind the gleaming fabrics and jewels were fully rounded individuals.
""Despite their starched clothing, they were as human as we are.""
Also going on display are 17th Century silver wine fountains made for William of Orange before he became King of England and a series of tapestries.

business	Diesel prices reach record of over Â£1.80 a litre	"UK diesel prices rose to a record of just over Â£1.80 a litre as efforts to stop importing fuel from Russia pushed up costs for retailers, the RAC said.
After the previous record of Â£1.79 was set in March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prices dipped but have risen again in recent weeks.
RAC said petrol prices went up by nearly 3p a litre since the start of May and were Â£1.66 a litre on average.
It said if EU members agreed to ban Russian oil, prices could rise further.
EU has been focusing for weeks on how to wean itself off Russian energy and has plans to phase out Russian crude oil over six months.
However, countries are split on how soon they wind down dependence - Hungary has rejected the proposal as unacceptable and the Czech and Slovak governments want a transition period.
UK is not as dependent on Russian oil as the EU is, however, almost a fifth of all UK diesel consumption was provided by Russian imports in 2020.
UK is also affected when global prices rise, despite its plans to stop Russian oil imports by the end of the year.
""Efforts to move away from importing Russian diesel have led to a tightening of supply and pushed up the price retailers pay for diesel,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams.
""Unfortunately, drivers with diesel vehicles need to brace themselves for yet more pain at the pumps."" 
In recent weeks, fuel sales have fallen as drivers have cut back on the number of journeys they make due to higher pump prices
Petrol station operator Ascona Group, which owns 60 UK petrol stations, said the amount of fuel it sold had dropped by 200,000 litres a week compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Managing director Darren Briggs said customers were making Â£20 to Â£30 fuel purchases ""last a little bit longer"".
Office for National Statistics revealed last week that the UK's economy shrank by 0.1% in March and said higher prices, including those at the petrol pumps, were ""really beginning to bite"".
wnturn came ahead of the impact of higher energy bills in April, which has sparked fears from analysts that the UK economy is at risk of a recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods - later this year.
Cutting diesel imports is tough
Analysis by Ben King, BBC business reporter
Cutting energy imports from Russia is a vital part of the West's plan to put the squeeze on the Putin regime and its war machine.
But when it comes to diesel, it's particularly tough - not least for the UK.
Diesel is produced by refining crude oil, and before the war, much of the UK's diesel supply was made in Russia and shipped to Britain in tankers.
Diesel supplies across the world were low before the crisis began, and the uncertainty surrounding the latest round of EU sanctions is helping to push those prices higher.
Most European countries are already reducing their imports of Russian oil and diesel - and imports from the Middle East and elsewhere are taking up some of the slack. But securing those extra supplies means paying higher prices. 
figures from the data firm Vortexa showed that just over half Europe's diesel imports were still coming from Russia. 
And the Asian head of the major oil trading firm Vitol, Mike Muller, warned earlier this month that EU rules which came into force on Sunday could make trading with Russia even harder, for instance by making it impossible to pay Russian suppliers.
's not likely to mean pumps running dry in the UK, says analyst Neil Crosby, who follows the diesel market for OilX.
""The UK itself may manage more or less to get by, but retail prices are not liable to cool any time soon,"" he said.  
In a bid to curb rising fuel prices, Chancellor Rishi Sunak cut the fuel duty by 5p a litre after previous record prices were seen in March.
RAC said then the cut was ""a drop in the ocean"" and now claimed drivers would be better off if had Mr Sunak reduced VAT on fuel.
""Had Mr Sunak reduced VAT to 15% as we called on him to do instead of cutting duty by 5p, drivers of diesel vehicles would be around 2p a litre better off, or Â£1 for every full tank,"" Mr Williams said.
""As it is, drivers are still paying 27p VAT on petrol and 29p on diesel, which is just the same as before the Spring Statement.""
reasury said it had introduced the ""biggest ever cut to all fuel duty rates - worth Â£5bn when taken together with the fuel duty freeze"".
""It will save the average UK car driver around Â£100, van driver around Â£200 and haulier over Â£1,500, based on average fuel consumption,"" a statement said.
government said businesses in general pay VAT on their sales but recover the tax on their purchases, meaning many can reclaim any VAT incurred when buying fuel.

Ahead of the invasion, fuel prices had already been rising after demand increased following the reopening of economies from coronavirus lockdowns."	/news/business-61463280
technology	Is it goodbye - finally - to the fax machine?	"fax machine is about to be pushed closer to the dustbin of history.
- formally known as a facsimile machine - was once a regular feature of British offices. 
But now the UK's communications regulator Ofcom is consulting on changes to telecoms rules that could formalise its obsolescence.
It would mean telecoms providers would no longer be required to provide fax services under the universal service obligation (USO).
""We're proposing changes to the rules"" Ofcom said.
Currently there are two designated telecoms providers responsible for universal service in the UK - BT and KCOM (in the Hull area only).
In 2003, Ofcom set up the USO, when fax machines were more prevalent and not so many people were connected by email and online messaging services. 
USO required BT and KCOM to provide fax services.
Ofcom said: ""Not only are alternatives to fax machines now more widely available, migration of telephone networks to internet protocol (IP) technology means fax services can no longer be guaranteed to work in the same way.""
regulator consulted widely on this last year: ""We considered it was appropriate for fax to be removed from the USO, given its limited ongoing use."" 
Millions of faxes have been sent and received over the years, some becoming landmarks in our communications history.
worked by allowing users to send an exact copy of a page of text or images to the recipient, using a telephone line.
f the reasons they were used in big-money transactions with tight deadlines, such as house sales, as they enabled contracts to be exchanged quickly and accurately.
Footballers' agents used faxing to secure the transfer of players, although the method has been retired by the Premier League.
Clubs now have the option of sending desktop faxes and scanned documents via email.
Basketball player Michael Jordan was responsible for one of the most famous faxes in sporting history in 1995, when he sent the message ""I'm back""  to the Chicago Bulls to let them know he was coming out of retirement. 
In recent years faxes have become more limited in use although are still working in some professions like medical administration, law enforcement and conveyancing. 
According to reports a few hundred fax machines are still in use within the NHS. 
In 2018 there was an immediate ban on the health service buying them, with the aim of phasing them out by 2020. 
At the time it was reported that many hospitals were still reliant on the machines, with thousands still in use.
Ofcom expects to publish a statement about the changes in early 2023."	/news/technology-63472371

Suffolk Police said a bomb disposal team from Colchester was called to Melford Hall, in Long Melford, on Wednesday.
Andrew Hagger, from the Suffolk Big Night Out, said he was ""gutted"" the show would not go ahead - but safety had to come first.
One device was found by a detectorist checking manhole covers, he said.
Melford Hall is a Grade I listed, National Trust property and dates from the 16th Century. 
Mr Hagger, events administrator for the charity Project Seven, said the event was last held in 2019 and had been cancelled three times due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
He said it last raised about Â£20,000 and the funds benefitted about 51 organisations. 
""I'm gutted, a lot of different organisations put in a lot of hard work and now won't get a donation,"" he said.
All tickets would be refunded and everyone's safety was ""paramount"" he added. 
He said he hoped it would go ahead in the same location next year. 
Suffolk Police said it was called at 16:15 GMT on Wednesday and the bomb squad arrived at 18:20. 
No evacuations took place and at 00:42 GMT the team left with the devices, to dispose of them safely, it added. 
A National Trust spokeswoman said the devices were ""cleared by the police overnight"".
""Following their advice, we now need to make sure the wider area is safe,"" she said.

politics	Sex education: Parents lose legal challenge against curriculum	"Parents have lost a legal challenge against the teaching of young children about gender identity and sex in primary schools across Wales.
Campaigners launched a judicial review in the High Court against the Welsh government's new relationships and sexuality education (RSE) curriculum.
It was launched in September and sees the mandatory teaching of these topics to pupils from the age of three.
gal challenge was rejected but claimants plan to appeal.
It follows a two-day legal hearing in November at the Civil Justice Centre in Cardiff.
mants were five parents of children of school age living in Wales who objected on religious and or philosophical grounds to their children being taught the subjects. 
Mrs Justice Steyn said: ""Teaching should be neutral from a religious perspective, but it is not required to be value neutral.""
It referenced sex education that aims to encourage ""tolerance between human beings irrespective of their sexual orientation and identity"" and enables children to deal critically with influences from society.
urt found the introduction of mandatory RSE had been ""the product of a process of careful consideration"".
All five claimants have ""moral and philosophical objections"" to the curriculum and wanted to exercise rights of excusal on behalf of their children to the classes, said Paul Diamond representing them. 
""The proposed teaching of RSE in Wales is specifically constructed to be value-laden since much of the teaching, particularly that regarding LGBTQ+, will concern not facts of a scientific nature but highly contentious theories relating to moral and behavioural choices made by individuals,"" he added.
""Were it to be taught as a stand-alone class and subject to a right of excusal, there would clearly not be any possibility of indoctrination.
""At stake in the present case is the question of whether there is any limit to what can be taught to children in schools or, ultimately, any place including the home and whether the state is to endorse the values of modern, liberal democracy or adopt instead a form of ideological totalitarianism."" 
However, Jonathan Moffett, representing the Welsh government, rejected the language used by the claimants.
He described ""such hyperbolic rhetoric"" as ""unhelpful"", adding the claimants had failed to identify ""what allegedly unlawful teaching"" the new curriculum would adopt and instead ""resort to broad assertions"".
""The claimants have not pointed to any passages in the code or the guidance that authorise or positively approve teaching that advocates or promotes any particular identity or sexual lifestyle over another, or that encourage children to self-identify in a particular way,"" he added.
In the judgement, Mrs Justice Steyn said: ""Openness to a plurality of ideas and the ability to engage sensitively, critically and respectfully with such debates, which RSE seeks to encourage and develop, fully accords with the aim of pluralism in a liberal and democratic state.""
Welcoming the judgment, education minister Jeremy Miles said he was ""appalled by the misinformation that has been purposefully spread by some campaigners"". 
He added: ""Parents can expect schools to engage with them about their plans for teaching RSE and to be able to raise any constructive questions or anxieties they have about those plans. 
""We will work closely with schools and communities to ensure that they are heard and they are clear about what their children will and will not be taught.""
Kim Isherwood, one of the claimants and spokeswoman for the campaign, said: ""We asked the High Court to recognise the overreach of power by the government, we asked the court to help us protect our children from future emotional, physical, and psychological harm. 
""The evidence we provided to the court referenced and highlighted concerning levels of betrayal, deceit and false claims made by the government, but it appears as though the judge agrees with them - not only do we parents not have rights, but they were never there to begin with.""
He added that the team plans to appeal the ruling to ""fight harder to protect our children from a dangerous woke agenda gone off the rails""."	/news/uk-wales-64067393

follows the death of a man at Manston, which may have been caused by diphtheria. 
Health secretary Steve Barclay said the risk to the public was ""very low"". 
During a visit to the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, Mr Barclay said a ""very high uptake"" of diphtheria vaccinations within the British public meant many people were well protected. 
He stressed that the situation was being monitored ""closely"".
Diphtheria is a highly contagious infection that affects the nose, throat and sometimes cause ulcers on the skin.
According to the NHS website, it is spread by coughs and sneezes or through close contact with someone who is infected, and in serious cases can be fatal.
It can also be spread by sharing items such as cups, cutlery, clothing or bedding with an infected person. 
UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there had been an ""increase"" in cases of diphtheria reported among migrants arriving in the UK.
It has confirmed 50 cases were identified as of 25 November, including among children. The figure stood at 39 on November 10.
Public health experts have raised concerns about the spread of the disease as migrants were moved to hotels.
UKHSA report said 38 of the cases have been reported in south-east England, with some cases also detected across London, the West Midlands and the north-east of England.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said any asylum seekers who may have the infection but are already in hotels will be told to isolate in their rooms while they are treated. 
He later confirmed the isolation centres would be similar to those used to curb infections during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Mr Jenrick told the Commons: ""From today, no-one presenting with symptoms will progress into the asylum accommodation system.
""They will either remain at Manston, isolating for a short period, or they will travel to a designated isolation centre in secure transport where they will be treated until deemed medically fit.""
reatment of migrants at the processing centre in Kent has triggered a wave of campaigns and concern from health professionals and campaigners. 
At one point, the facility designed to hold 1,600 people contained 4,000. 
Charity Detention Action launched a legal campaign to remove migrants housed in the facility for longer than 24 hours.  
Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the overcrowding was caused by a lack of suitable accommodation.
She told MPs: ""What I have refused to do is to prematurely release thousands of people into local communities without having anywhere for them to stay.""
A post-mortem examination is being carried out to determine the cause of death of the man who died after being held at Manston.  A test indicated ""diphtheria may be the cause"" of his illness, government officials have said."	/news/uk-63788016

Others will ask: if a Holyrood majority for indyref2 is not accepted as a mandate by Westminster then what is the democratic route to independence?

Plan A - that Westminster would accept a Holyrood majority for indyref2 as a mandate has failed. 
Plan B - that the courts might allow a referendum without Westminster consent has failed.

Ms Sturgeon has previously said she would seek to win more than 50% of the vote in the election and if successful would claim that as a mandate for independence. 
She recommitted to that plan in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling but left some of the details to a special SNP conference to be held in the New Year. 
It would be a huge gamble. 
In its best ever election result in 2015, the SNP fell just short of 50%.

Even some on Nicola Sturgeon's side privately hope she will back off this all-or-nothing approach. 
Because if this Plan C fails, it would be time for a new independence strategy and presumably new leadership of the SNP. 
Nicola Sturgeon refuses to be drawn on what would happen in these circumstances, except to say: ""if we can't win, we don't deserve to be independent""."	/news/uk-scotland-63729280

four-month-old boy is in a hospital in Auckland awaiting urgent treatment to correct a heart disorder. 
His parents had blocked the operation and sought a court ruling that he receive blood from unvaccinated donors.
But the High Court ruled the operation was in the child's ""best interest"".
Justice Ian Gault ordered that the boy - identified as Baby W in court documents - be placed under the guardianship of the court ""from the date of the order until completion of his surgery and post-operative recovery"". 
He dismissed the parents' request for unvaccinated blood and agreed with health authorities that the boy's ""survival [was] actually dependent on the application being granted"". 
But he emphasised that the parents remained the boy's primary guardians and said doctors must keep them informed at all times about his treatment and condition. 
Justice Gault also rejected a request from the parents' lawyer, Sue Grey, that a tailored donor service with blood from exclusively unvaccinated donors be established. 
Ms Grey said the long-term effects of the vaccine were ""untested"" and accused doctors of refusing to provide an alternate donor service for ideological reasons. 
But lawyers for the state blood service said the establishment of any direct donor service would have been a ""slippery slope"" and would ""damage an excellent blood service"".

Ms Sanders revealed her situation after Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH) was criticised by a coroner ruling on the death of a two-year-old boy , who died of a respiratory condition caused by exposure to the mould in his flat.
She said the ""horrendous"" mould problem left her son's skin ""red raw and bleeding"".
Ms Sanders said: ""Over the years I've lived here it's just got worse and it's starting to grow.
""The smell is horrendous, it's an odd smell but you know that smell is mould.""
Her 15-year-old son was diagnosed with ""contact dermatitis"", by their GP and they were told it was caused by ""allergens in the air, such as mould, damp and condensation"".
""Where his skin is peeling off it's red raw, it's bleeding it's cracking"", she added.

UK-based research company Airfinity said its model estimates cases in China could reach more than three million a day in January.
Despite the official numbers being low, the World Health Organization has warned the healthcare system in China could be under severe pressure.
Reuters have reported that Chinese hospitals have been overwhelmed during the Christmas period, with footage showing long queues for clinics and patients on hospital beds in the middle of busy waiting rooms.
Videos have been emerging on social media throughout December appearing to show crowded hospitals.
By cross-referencing with other images posted online, the BBC has been able to verify two videos of overcrowding at a children's hospital in the city of Tianjin in northern China.
However we have not been able to verify many of the other videos which have emerged. 
It's difficult to confirm how severe the situation is compared with normal as China strictly controls information coming out of the country.
BBC's team in Beijing have reported on long queues outside health clinics, and on the high demand for fever remedies at pharmacies.
mporary health centres are being set up along with intensive care facilities across the country.
National broadcaster CCTV has reported that Beijing's Chaoyang Hospital will boost its capability as the number of incoming patients increased by fourfold.
It's also been reported that in Shanghai an extra 230,000 hospital beds have been made available. 
re has been a sudden lifting of many of China's Covid restrictions following November's protests against strict lockdowns across the country.
Before the recent relaxation, China had one of the toughest anti-Covid regimes in the world - known as its zero-Covid policy. 
measures included strict lockdowns even if only a handful of Covid cases had been found, mass testing in places where cases were reported, and people with Covid having to isolate at home or under quarantine at government facilities.
Lockdowns have now been scrapped, and quarantine rules have been abolished.
A negative Covid test is no longer required to enter public transport, restaurants, gyms and other public buildings (with the exception of orphanages and care homes).
Chinese authorities have also said they will fully open borders from 8 January with no travel restrictions or quarantine measures for arrivals.
Several countries including the US have imposed Covid testing on visitors from China due to its ongoing Covid surge.
Overall, China says more than 90% of the population has been fully vaccinated. 
However, less than half of people aged 80 and over have received three doses of vaccine. The vaccination rate back in April among this age group was much lower - less than 20%.  
uthorities now say they require local health services to ""strengthen immunization of the whole population, particularly the elderly"".
re are doubts over whether the main vaccines used in China - Sinovac and Sinopharm - are effective against Omicron, the most widespread strain.
China has refused to use Western vaccines widely.
government has given no official explanation. However, national pride may be a factor according to Dr Yu Jie, Senior Research Fellow on China at the international affairs think tank Chatham House:
""I think it's Xi Jinping really thinking of things in terms of economic self-reliance - that need to have China produce and use its own vaccine, rather than import it from somewhere.""

entertainment	Peter Kay announces return to stand-up during I'm A Celebrity	"Comedian Peter Kay has announced his return to stand-up with his first live tour in 12 years.
49-year-old has been largely absent from the spotlight since he cancelled his 2017 tour due to ""unforeseen family circumstances"".
Announcing his new live dates, Kay said: ""It's good to get back to what I love doing best, stand-up comedy.""
His comeback was announced during an ad break in the series launch of ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!
DJ Chris Moyles, rugby player Mike Tindall and singer Boy George were all seen entering the jungle in Sunday's opening episode, but the former health secretary Matt Hancock will not appear until later in the series. 
During the commercial break, Kay was seen carrying a rolled-up carpet into a house while confirming to nearby fans he will return to stand-up comedy next month.
median will embark on a new UK arena tour, spanning from December to August 2023.
What is it like seeing Peter Kay live 38 times?
By Daniel Rosney, BBC News Entertainment reporter
Back in 2010 I worked as a yellow blazer-wearing steward (""no filming of the stage, please"") at the Manchester Arena - something Peter Kay himself had previously done - and it was there that The Tour That Doesn't Tour Tour was on for 20 nights.
It later did go on tour, and returned for a further 20 shows.
Fans would cry tears of laughter at his opening gambit about those in their seats being his employer for the night, along with his impressions of people using an ""I'm ill"" voice to call their boss and bunk off work for the day. 
He'd reference his old jokes as well: ""Every time I go to an Italian restaurant, they give me free garlic breadâ¦ it's why my new catch-phrase is plas-maâ¦ plas-maâ¦."" (because he wanted a free TV set).
While the routine was largely the same every show, I still laughed out loud each time, along with those seeing it for the first time. His observational comedy was something everyone could relate to.
""Have we got any teachers in?"" he'd ask. There'd be a cheer. ""Woah, woah, woah, no shouting out, put your hands up, one rule for oneâ¦""
But it was his encore which proved he's a true showman. He'd impersonate Freddie Mercury, using a shovel as a make-shift guitar, belting out the hits he and audiences loved. 
After a near two-hour comedy gig he became a rock star and people would be on their feet wanting more and they're finally getting it. 
I didn't get to keep my yellow blazer when I traded it in for a BBC lanyard, but given Peter Kay sometimes wore one to show his fans to their seats, he might get one dry-cleaned, just in case.
will mark Kay's first live tour since 2010, when he scored the Guinness World Record for the biggest selling stand-up tour of all time, playing to more than 1.2 million people.
rt concluded with the fans asking Kay whether he had finally bought his mother a bungalow - a reference the comic's previous Mum Wants A Bungalow tour. Kay replied that he had, explaining that his mother now wanted a new carpet to go in it.
In a statement, the Bolton-born comic said: ""It's good to get back to what I love doing best, stand-up comedy, and if there's ever a time people need a laugh it's now.
""And with the cost of living at an all-time high, ticket prices are starting from Â£35 - the same price they were on my previous tour in 2010.""
Kay will begin his tour on 2 December at the Manchester AO Arena before visiting locations including Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield, Belfast, Newcastle, Glasgow and Dublin.
His run will end on 11 August at the Sheffield Utilita Arena. London was absent from the tour locations listed in the advert.
A poster for the event featured Kay holding a sign reading, ""Better late than never"" and described a ticket to his shows as an ""ideal Christmas gift"".
Kay has kept a low profile in recent years. He notably returned to the stage in August 2021 for two special charity events to raise money for Laura Nuttall, a then 20-year-old with an aggressive type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme.
re was also a brief return in January 2021 when he appeared on BBC Radio 2 for a conversation with Cat Deeley - who was filling in after Graham Norton left the station - about his love of music, mixtapes and the musical Mamma Mia.
He also made a surprise appearance at a charity screening of his series Car Share in 2018."	/news/entertainment-arts-63537991
health	Weston General Hospital improves after 'inadequate' rating	"Hospital staff have been praised for helping it improve, but bosses admit there is more to be done.
Weston General Hospital has been upgraded from its ""inadequate"" rating by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
CQC rated the hospital 'requires improvement' after an inspection in August, up from inadequate - the lowest the health regulator can give.
It found staffing was stretched, although there were sufficient numbers to keep patients safe, 
's surgical unit and identification of blood clot risks were areas where improvement was found to be needed.
Concerns were also raised about racist behaviour towards staff, highlighted as a priority to hospital leadership, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
But the report also found that staff provided good care, treated patients with kindness, and that the Weston General's leaders had the skills to run the hospital well and were making improvements.
Chief executive of the NHS trust that runs the hospital, Eugine Yafele, said: ""I absolutely want to congratulate the team at Weston on getting the hospital to be on a firm footing of recovery and improvement.""
Mr Yafele added: ""What this also highlights is there is a steely determination, because the people who have done this are people at Weston, and actually 'requires improvement' is the start.
""I think their ambitions, and the ambitions we have for patients, are to go beyond that.""
Chief Medical Officer Stuart Walker insisted: ""I think its absolutely the case that there has been a very significant improvement.
""Now, that may manifest itself - in CQC function and how they process things - as inadequate to our eye but there has been a major improvement in the quality of care being able to be offered there.""

politics	Haverhill council asks Hancock to quit over I'm a Celeb	"A town council has called on former health secretary Matt Hancock to quit as the local MP after he signed up for I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!
Mr Hancock was suspended by the Conservatives after he joined the ITV show while Parliament was sitting.
Haverhill Town Council has written a letter expressing its ""displeasure"" at his participation on the show and urged him to resign as West Suffolk MP. 
Mr Hancock's office said he ""is still working on constituency matters"".
Earlier in the week, Mr Hancock defended his decision and sources close to him said it was an ""incredible opportunity for him to engage with the 12m Brits"", using his time in the Australian jungle to promote his dyslexia campaign.
ment added: ""Matt has an excellent team working with him in West Suffolk, but producers have agreed that he can communicate with them if there's an urgent constituency matter.""
In a letter to Mr Hancock, Haverhill Town Council's clerk Colin Poole said by a majority vote members directed him to ""express their displeasure"" at the MP's decision to absent himself from constituency duties.
""At a time when unprecedented cost-of-living pressures on your residents are causing real hardship to them... my members believe we need all hands on deck to fight our corner.
""Currently there is nobody to speak for West Suffolk in the House of Commons,"" the letter said.
It added: ""By your actions you have made it clear to everyone that you see your future outside of politics.
""My members ask that you do the honourable thing and resign your seat.""
Mr Hancock's office said the second reading of his Dyslexia Screening and Teacher Training Bill was expected days after the current series ends.
As a result, he said Mr Hancock's appearance on the ITV show was ""an amazing opportunity for Matt to raise the profile of his dyslexia bill and to talk about an issue he really cares about in front of millions of people"".
""As well as raising awareness of dyslexia, Matt will be raising thousands of pounds for charity off the back of his appearance - with donations going to both St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk, and the British Dyslexia Association,"" the spokesman said.
""Matt is still working on constituency matters and has held a number of online meetings this week already.""
Earlier this week, a number of groups, politicians and constituents spoke out against Mr Hancock appearing on the reality show, where contestants face gruelling challenges involving spiders, snakes and bugs.
Mr Hancock has been out of government since he resigned as health secretary, after he broke coronavirus lockdown rules by having an affair in his departmental office.
After that incident, councillors on Newmarket Town Council, also in his constituency, passed a vote of no confidence in the West Suffolk MP.
former health secretary will be a late addition to the ITV show, which returns to Australia this year and will star Euro 2022 winner Jill Scott, ex-rugby star Mike Tindall and singer Boy George, among others.
ry chief whip said Mr Hancock's participation on the show while Parliament was sitting was ""serious enough"" to warrant suspension.
When MPs have the whip suspended, they are kicked out of the party within Parliament, but remain an MP and continue to be paid.

entertainment	An incomplete history of pop on BBC television	"""It's Thursday night, it's seven o'clock, it's Top Of The Pops!""
fans of a certain age, that phrase is dopamine rush. It means homework can be forgotten, the weekend is tantalisingly close, and pop music is about to happen in our drab 1980s living room. 
If you're lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of your childhood crush, Cheryl from Bucks Fizz, who seemed like she'd definitely want to visit your house for a game of Connect 4 (OK, maybe that part was just me).
Of The Pops ruled the roost for 42 years, introducing the UK to Marc Bolan, David Bowie, Madonna, The Stone Roses and the Spice Girls, in an era when pop music was still scarce and exotic. 
But TOTP, as no-one ever called it outside of the print media, wasn't the BBC's only dalliance with the charts.  
In fact, more than 70 different pop and rock shows have elbowed their way into the schedules since the BBC's inception 100 years ago.
Here's a tour of the highlights and low points.
In the BBC's early years, popular music was squeezed into variety shows and magazine programmes, with classical concerts and opera forming the bulk of the corporation's music programming.
ged in 1952, with the debut of The Hit Parade, described by the Radio Times as ""the most ambitious attempt yet made to present popular music on the screen in a directly visual way"".
Based on a US format, it featured about eight songs per half-hour episode, played by an in-house band instead of the original recording artists.
Foreshadowing Top Of The Pops, the show highlighted each song's chart position, with the relevant number built into the staging; while a troupe of dancers called The Stargazers interpreted the lyrics.
It set a template for shows like 1955's Off The Record, where Buddy Holly made his only UK TV appearance; and 1959's Drumbeat, ""30 fast-moving minutes of music in the ultra-modern manner, that will make the old-fashioned 'rug cutters' feel like members of a knitting circle"".
But it was The Six-Five Special (1957-58) that marked the BBC's first real attempt to bring rock and roll to the small screen. 
It's biggest innovation was allowing the audience to roam the studio floor, instead of sitting attentively in tiered seating, giving the show the kinetic energy of a concert.
Six-Five Special burst onto the television on Saturday evening, 16 February 1957.
w was hosted by Radio Luxembourg DJ, Pete Murray, who came up with the catchphrase ""Time to jive on the old six-five"" - a play on its Saturday night time slot, 6:05pm. 
However, Murray almost didn't get the gig, with a young Scottish bodybuilder coming a close second in auditions. 
Producer Jack Good later stood by his decision. ""I think I was right,"" he told TV historian Jeff Evans. ""Sean Connery turned out to be great as James Bond but I didn't think he was cut out for introducing pop music.""
Six-Five Special fell apart when the BBC insisted on adding educational segments, prompting Good to quit for ITV, where his non-stop music show Oh Boy! trounced Six-Five Special in the ratings.
Replacements included 1958's Dig This!, 1963's The 625 Show (where the Beatles made their TV debut) and 1961's Hot Ice and Cool Music which took place, for no apparent reason, on an ice rink.
Of The Pops finally debuted on New Year's Day 1964, broadcast from a converted church in Manchester.
Initially commissioned for six episodes, its gimmick was to focus solely on songs that were climbing up the Top 40; with each programme culminating in the week's number one single. 
In doing so, it gave equal weight to global pop stars, ground-breaking new artists, anodyne family favourites and cheesy novelty nonsense. 
A typical episode from 1978 saw punk upstarts The Boomtown Rats sharing airtime with Father Abraham and the Smurfs. Tonal consistency was neither offered nor desired.
A selection of Top of the Pops' opening titles
Dusty Springfield was the first ever artist to perform, playing I Only Want To Be With You, followed by the Rolling Stones' rambunctious I Wanna Be Your Man.
Beatles' I Want To Hold Your Hand was that week's number one, but the band weren't available to perform, so producer Johnnie Stewart put together a montage of archive footage, newsreels and still images to accompany the song.
While other shows prioritised live music, Top Of The Pops' focus on the singles chart meant it could unashamedly allow artists to mime. In the beginning, they would even show a female assistant putting a needle on the record before bands stated playing. 
A staple of the schedules, The Pops ran for 2,271 episodes, going colour in 1969, expanding to 45 minutes in 1970, and generating a spin off show, TOTP2, in the 1990s.
Memorable moments include Neneh Cherry performing Buffalo Stance while seven months pregnant; Nirvana sabotaging their performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit; and David Bowie suggestively draping his arm around Mick Ronson during Starman - a watershed moment in pop that introduced a generation to androgyny.

w ended in 2006 after falling viewing figures prompted a move to BBC Two and, ultimately, complete cancellation. The final number one on the final programme was Shakira's Hips Don't Lie. 
But the Christmas special has somehow survived, and archive editions are repeated on BBC Four. However, the show's long association with Jimmy Savile means that many episodes are now unbroadcastable.
Where there's music, there's music trivia. And where there's trivia, there are disputes. And disputes makes great television. 
BBC cottoned onto this early on, with Juke Box Jury (1959-67, plus revivals in 1979 and 1989), where celebrity panellists and the studio audience would debate the merits of the week's new releases before declaring them a ""hit"" or a ""miss"".
Host David Jacobs was not particularly enamoured with the format, saying the first episode was ""so very dreadful that by the middle of it I was wishing I could just get up and go"". 
But viewers disagreed. At its peak, the show attracted 12 million viewers, rising to 23 million for a special edition with The Beatles as the panellists. 
Fab Four unanimously voted The Swinging Blue Jeans' Hippy Hippy Shake a ""hit"" but declared The Orchids' Love Hit Me a ""miss"", only to discover the band were in the studio - something John Lennon described as ""a lousy trick"".

Digesting the musical themes of the day was also integral to See You Sunday (1973-75), which looked at the religious themes of songs by Cat Stevens and Randy Newman. 
And BBC Two's Something Else (1978-82) was presented by a team of inexperienced but earnest teenagers, who discussed social issues like unemployment, alcoholism and arranged marriages against a backdrop of music.
It attracted a huge following in the punk and indie scene, with bands like The Undertones, The Clash, Siouxsie and the Banshees playing live; and Paul Weller taking charge of an entire episode, devoted to the topic of inequality.
A discussion on fashion also featured an early TV appearance by George O'Dowd, before he rechristened himself as Boy George.

On a lighter note, kids TV had Cheggers Plays Pop (1978-86) in which human Duracell bunny Keith ""Cheggers"" Chegwin would pit children against each other in a battle of musical knowledge (""True or false, Cameo's hit is called 'Fed Up'?""), interspersed with inflatable assault courses and copious amounts of shaving foam. 
Primetime TV also got Mike Read's Pop Quiz (1981-84) and its petulant offspring Never Mind The Buzzcocks (1996 - present day).
r is best known for its ""intros round"", where two panellists perform an a wordless rendition of a popular song for their teammate to guess.  If you haven't seen Adele humming N*E*R*D's Lapdance to a bewildered Tim Minchin, you haven't lived.
Buzzcocks' take-no-prisoners approach produced dozens of memorable moments. 
Ordinary Boys frontman Preston stormed off the set in 2007, after host Simon Amstell read excerpts from his then-wife Chantelle Hughes' autobiography. 
And in 2013, BBC 6 Music presenter Huey Morgan smashed a mug in apparent frustration with his lyrics being used in the ""next lines"" round.
Preston storms off Never Mind The Buzzcocks
magazine show The O-Zone (1989-2000) also took a less-than-reverential approach to pop stars; a tactic that was frankly necessary in the surly, monosyllabic era of Britpop.
Along the way, it produced some televisual gold.
Witness Jayne Middlemiss asking Eminem ""what have boybands ever done to you?"" or her playfully revealing interview with David Bowie, and tell me this programme wasn't peak music television.
David Bowie speaks to Jayne Middlemiss a day after his 50th birthday concert in New York.
roughout the 1960s and 70s, the day's biggest pop stars were given their own variety shows on BBC One. 
Lulu, Cliff Richard, Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw, Leo Sayer and, er, Val Doonican all had their own series, built around music, but interspersed with sketches from the likes of Dudley Moore, Sid James and even Basil Brush.
Leaning on their music industry connections, the hosts often persuaded huge stars such as Aretha Franklin, Bill Withers and Kate Bush to perform alongside them. 
Aretha Franklin on The Cliff Richard Show in 1970
But Lulu's show came a cropper in 1969 when she booked the Jimi Hendrix Experience as her musical guests.
Freaked out by the stuffy atmosphere, the band got stoned in their dressing room, and plotted to rob Lulu of her planned duet on Hey Joe. 
On stage, they deliberately fumbled the song, before Hendrix declared ""We'd like to stop playing this rubbish,"" and launched into Cream's Sunshine of Your Love, before producers pulled the plug.
Jimi Hendrix pulled off the air during the Happening For Lulu show in 1969
According to rock and roll legend, the stunt got the group banned from BBC Television.
More recently, the BBC has devoted one-off specials to stars like Harry Styles, BTS, Ariana Grande and Adele - whose attempt to infiltrate an Adele impersonator contest became a viral smash.
For as long as Top Of The Pops existed, grumpy old men complained ""that's not real music"". And so the BBC gave them shows of their own, just to shut them up.
It began with 1968's All Systems Freeman. Conceived as ""Radio 1 in vision"", it found DJ Alan ""Fluff"" Freeman playing new releases on a set of turntables while interviewing acts like The Beach Boys and Cat Stevens in oversized headphones. 
When it was cancelled after one series, Freeman was furious. ""That show was a knockout,"" he fumed to Deejay magazine. ""They really should never have taken it off.""
1968 also brought BBC Two's Colour Me Pop, conceived as an alternative to Top Of The Pops, where groups like Fleetwood Mac, The Kinks and The Small Faces played full, 30-minute live shows.
format continued on Disco Two, which devoted an entire show Bob Dylan in July 1970; and In Concert, whose most famous episode captured Neil Young playing Harvest before it was released.
were all dry runs for The Old Grey Whistle Test, an album music magazine programme, broadcast live on BBC Two for 45 weeks every year. 
Commissioned by David Attenborough in 1971, it was broadcast at end of the day's schedule and often exceeded its timeslot, stretching into the night on a heady cocktail of ""good vibes"" and ""serious jams"".
Along the way, it showcased everyone from Bob Marley and Roxy Music to Patti Smith and Meat Loaf - whose first ever performance of Bat Out Of Hell was so popular it was given an unprecedented repeat the following week.
Bob Marley and The Wailers' TV debut on The Old Grey Whistle Test
-back style of presenter ""Whispering"" Bob Harris launched a thousand parodies (most notably, The Fast Show's Jazz Club). But his inquisitive and knowledgeable interviews with artists like Bruce Springsteen and John Lennon are the gold standard.
When the BBC broadcast Live Aid in 1985, Whistle Test's team helmed the coverage - lending the event a gravitas that Top of the Pops' more chummy presenters couldn't have managed.
As the classic rock era faded, so did Whistle Test. It ended in 1988, clearing a path for Laterâ¦ With Jools Holland.
Debuting in 1992, the show's concept was simple but flawless: Five or six bands were crammed into a studio, arranged in a circle, and forced to play live, passing the torch after every song.
""The energy palpably rises in the room and on television as the artists spur each other on,"" recalls co-creator Mark Cooper. ""It's the only show where the musicians feel like they come first and they're singing to each other around a fire pit.""
first episode featured The Neville Brothers, The Christians and D-Influence. But as its reputation grew, a Who's Who of rock graced the studio: REM, Johnny Cash, Kanye West, Arctic Monkeys, Norah Jones, Jay-Z, Smokey Robinson, Bo Diddley, Nick Cave, Radiohead, Oasis, Bon Iver, Lana Del Reyâ¦. joined by up-and-coming artists of every genre, from every corner of the globe.
w also has a reputation for breaking artists: Adele gave her first ever TV performance on Later, months before she released her first album. Portishead put themselves on the map with a mesmerising version of Glory Box in 1994. And Macy Gray, KT Tunstall and Rag N' Bone Man all saw significant sales boosts after early appearances on the show.
Some of the world's most recognisable musicians looked impossibly young when they played their Later debut
""It reveals the nuts and bolts of bands,"" said BjÃ¶rk, a regular guest. Robbie Williams simply dubbed it ""Top of the Pops with pubes"".
w recently celebrated its 30th anniversary - but Cooper, who has just published a book on the show's history, hints that its future wasn't always guaranteed.
""There's always been a slight tension between the BBC's desire to serve popular music and the fact that it doesn't really put very much money into it - hence Whistle Test being shot in a broom cupboard. 
""But the powers that be at the BBC really value popular music and want to create an archive of that. And that's been one of the drivers, I think, for Later lasting.""
BBC has occasionally played its part in manufacturing pop stars, starting in 1966, when it brought The Monkees' anarchic US sitcom to UK viewers. 
ree decades later, it revived the idea in Miami 7, the fake story of the real band S Club 7, as they chased fame and fortune in the US.
Pop star Sheena Easton got her big break on a 1980 edition of The Big Time, a documentary series where each episode followed an aspiring star - a chef, a model, a footballer - as they tried to make it big.
After being advised to avoid drugs by celebrity coach Dusty Springfield, Easton went on to record a Bond theme, have a fling with Prince, and prompt the introduction of Parental Advisory stickers on explicit records. 
Not bad going.

In the 2000s, reality TV produced some of the UK's biggest new stars, but the BBC never fully grasped the nettle. 
ruly exploitative, its answer to Pop Idol was Fame Academy (2002), where contestants were encouraged to take songwriting lessons instead of scratching each other's eyes out.
But by the law of averages, the BBC's talent shows managed to uncover some genuine talent, including Lemar (Fame Academy), Becky Hill (The Voice UK) and Oscar nominee Jessie Buckley (I'd Do Anything).
BBC's own stars have occasionally troubled the charts, too. EastEnders gave us the regrettable chart runs of Anita Dobson and Nick Berry, while Neighbours' overwhelming success in the UK sparked the musical careers of Kylie, Jason and Natalie Imbruglia.
Mr Blobby, The Teletubbies and Fireman Sam all topped the charts, too, for which we're sorry.
And who can forget Kenny Everett's Snot Rap, a cloth-eared rant about hip-hop lyrics, memorable only for the line: ""You can chuck in the word circumcision/ 'Cos we ain't going to Eurovision.""
Speaking of which... 
Broadcasting a major music festival isn't as simple as turning up and pointing a microphone at it. Glastonbury alone needs more than 60 cameras, and miles of cabling under the green fields of Worthy Farm. 
But the BBC has always made a strong case for broadcasting live music, from the Proms to the Jubilee and Radio 1's Big Weekend.
Eurovision was the first and the biggest. The world's most-watched non-sporting event, with an annual audience of over 200 million, it began in 1956 as a technical experiment to see whether a live, simultaneous, international broadcast was possible (in reality, there were so few televisions at the time that the contest was primarily consumed on radio).
first contest was held in Switzerland under the catchy title, ""Grand Prix Eurovision de la Chanson EuropÃ©enne"". Only seven countries took part, not including the UK, who were preoccupied with their own contest, The Festival of British Popular Songs.

, the contest is open to 52 countries, launching the careers of stars like Abba, Celine Dion, Bucks Fizz and Conchita Wurst. 
UK is famously bad at it, but managed to come second in 2022 thanks to Sam Ryder's iron-clad power ballad Space Man. 
, beloved, exasperated Sir Terry Wogan, meanwhile, set the bar for Eurovision commentary.
Sir Terry Wogan's best Eurovision moments
Brit Awards came to the BBC in 1985, just in time for Frankie Goes To Hollywood to win best single for Relax - a song the corporation had banned.
But the show generally ran smoothly until 1989, when Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood presided over an absolute fiasco on live TV. 
Constantly drowned out by Brosettes, they stumbled over their lines and announced the wrong guests on stage (The Four Tops turned out to be a very unimpressed Boy George). 
Government minister Kenneth Baker was booed by the audience and a pre-recorded message from Michael Jackson was never broadcast, despite the show ending several minutes early. 
BBC lost the Brits to ITV three years later - but it still had the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party, where prize categories included Most Brilliant Haircut and Most Horrible Thing, which was invariably won by spiders. 
BBC still covers the Mercury Prize and the Mobo Awards annually, which remain largely tarantula-free.
After bouncing between Channel 4 and ITV, the Glastonbury Festival partnered with the BBC in 1997, since when viewers have enjoyed historic performances by Jay-Z, Stormzy, Pulp, BeyoncÃ©, Bowie, Dolly, The Stones, Adele, Macca and Springsteen. 
But the best moments are always the unplanned ones: Pet Shop Boy Chris Lowe getting trapped behind a video screen. ""Alex from Glasto"" becoming a viral sensation after Dave plucked him from the crowd to rap Thiago Silva. Adele burping in a fan's face and saying: ""Sorry, I had a dirty burger before I came on."" Iconic.
""Would you do it again?"" Highlights from 50 years of Glastonbury
In total, 31.4 million people watched the festival this year, while Kylie Minogue's emotional 2019 set - which came 14 years after a cancer diagnosis forced her to cancel a planned headline slot - is the most-watched Glastonbury performance of all time.
Although Later soldiers on, the BBC no longer has a regular, primetime outlet for pop music on TV. 
mpt, Sounds Like Friday Night, limped off the screens in 2018 after two series.
Produced by Carpool Karaoke creators Fulwell 73, the show was crammed with sketches and stunts, with the result that each episode only featured four or five songs - as opposed to the 10 or 12 Top Of The Pops used to manage. 
When viewership for the second series dipped below 2 million, its days were numbered.
How many of their hits can Little Mix perform in 60 seconds?
result is that pop's biggest names are back in the same situation as their 1950 counterparts, competing for airtime on variety and magazine programmes like Strictly Come Dancing and The One Show.
Music sneaks into the schedules in other ways: The Hit List is a fresh twist on Name That Tune; BBC Three's The Rap Game UK is fiery and compelling; and there's a rich seam of documentaries like My Life As A Rolling Stone, Reclaiming Amy and Bros: After The Screaming Stops..
But let's face it, a weekly pop show doesn't make sense in the streaming era. 
rts are too fickle and fragmented to make compelling viewing, and the thrill of catching your favourite band on Top Of The Pops has been replaced by the ability to watch them 24/7 on YouTube.
But that's not to suggest the BBC's turned its back on pop. In fact, one weekend at Glastonbury adds more music to the BBC's archive than a year's worth of Top of the Pops (at significantly less cost). 
Footage from Reading and Leeds, Radio 1's Live Lounge and Radio 2 In Concert more than doubles that total.
And in 50 years' time, those clips will be just as valuable and nostalgic as those Top Of The Pops repeats are today.

It's a title inspired by world events, according to singer Hayley Williams.
""Every time I can't believe [something] is happening, whether it's planet, politics, social stuff, I'm always, 'this is why we can't have nice things'.""
33-year-old says the break allowed her and the band to reflect and think about everything around them.
""We all really needed it to find our identity apart from Paramore and all the public projection we get in our life,"" she told Radio 1's Future Sounds with Clara Amfo.
""I learned how introverted I really am.""
weekend Hayley, guitarist Taylor York and drummer Zac Farro will be playing their first live shows in more than four years.
Hayley says the time during Covid, when much of the world was forced inside, helped her to reconnect with her roots.
""I don't think I would have slowed down, gotten time with my family,"" she says.
""I was glad we were home because we were part of our own community in Nashville, and we got to be a part of it as citizens, as friends, a daughter, a sister and it wasn't really about Paramore.""
""None of us knew we were going to be forced all the way inside.""
But time away in isolation didn't stop the band from thinking about their fans, and importantly building their album.
""I think if you talk to anybody, it was such a ridiculously tragic time,"" Hayley says.
I thought about the fans, the shows, the whole time we were writing the entire album.""
And the UK was at the forefront of their minds.
""We just have such a cool relationship with our fans around the world. But there is something really special about the UK and the lineage of bands that are from there."" 
""We were really digging up our oldest influences from across the pond. And every time I would imagine playing a show it was some festival in the UK or some crowd that we played in places like Manchester."" 
As for touring the country in 2023? She teases ""it won't be long"".
""We already have the plan,"" she says.
""And I cannot wait for people to find out who we're playing with. I'm just so excited to get back over there.""

sports	Funding for indoor skate park gives Stoke children opportunity	"An indoor skatepark in Stoke-on-Trent has reduced the cost of its classes and bought new equipment to help parents with the cost of living crisis.
Unit 1 Park Works, in Hanley, said the Â£4,500 for equipment from the National Lottery had enabled children to keep their ""social environment"".
rk opened due to a lack of facilities and outdoor skate parks often being unsafe to use in winter.
""We want to make it as cheap as possible,"" founder Jess Siegertsz said.
In 2016 Unit 1 was set up by Ashley Kosciekowski and Ms Siegertsz. 
It had been Mr Kosciekowski's dream to build one for the community of Stoke after growing up without a place to go indoors.
When Ms Siegertsz learnt how to skate, she said her mother ""couldn't believe [Stoke] didn't have a skatepark"".
""My mum donated her life savings, sold her house, just because she saw how passionate we were about the sport and how it would benefit the community,"" Ms Siegertsz said.
""Since the cost of living crisis, everything is so expensive so we have had to reduced our prices to try and encourage people to come,"" the 27-year-old said.
rk received Â£4,500 in funding to buy new equipment such as skateboards, for the children to use. 
kate park has also seen an increase in female skateboarders.
""Sky Brown has been an inspiration for young girls,"" Ms Siegertsz said.
Miss Brown became Team GB's youngest ever Olympic medallist at the age of 13, when she won bronze in the women's park skateboarding at Tokyo 2020.
""We now actually have more female skate students than male students since Sky Brown,"" Ms Siegertsz said.
Unit 1 also runs a women and girls-only night every Wednesday which has now become more popular than the general admission sessions.

business	737 Max: Boeing to pay $200m over charges it misled investors	"Boeing is to pay out $200m (Â£177.5m) over charges that it misled investors about two fatal 737 Max crashes.
US stock market regulator said the aviation giant and its former chief executive Dennis Muilenburg made false statements about safety issues. 
Boeing ""put profits over people"" in an effort to rehabilitate its image, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
737 Max was grounded for 20 months after two crashes killed 346 people.
As part of the settlement Mr Muilenburg will also pay a penalty of $1m.
""In times of crisis and tragedy, it is especially important that public companies and executives provide full, fair, and truthful disclosures to the markets,"" SEC chairman Gary Gensler said in a statement.
Boeing and Mr Muilenburg ""failed in this most basic obligation,"" he added.
SEC's statement also said that both Boeing and Mr Muilenburg did not admit or deny the regulator's findings.
""We will never forget those lost on Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, and we have made broad and deep changes across our company in response to those accidents,"" Boeing said in response to the SEC's announcement.
""Fundamental changes that have strengthened our safety processes and oversight of safety issues, and have enhanced our culture of safety, quality, and transparency,"" the company added.
SEC said a fund will be established for investors who suffered losses due to the misleading information between 2018 and 2019.
ment is largely symbolic. The 737 Max scandal has already cost Boeing tens of billions - another $200m will barely register.
But it does give the SEC the chance to call out Boeing and its ex-chief executive Dennis Muilenburg for making assurances about the plane's safety, when they already knew it had a serious problem - thereby misleading investors.
It's unlikely this will cause Boeing any meaningful harm. Its corporate reputation had already been severely damaged by the affair. The company is now working hard to restore it, and regain public and investor confidence.
For Mr Muilenberg himself, the financial consequences of the settlement won't be that painful either. He received some $60m in compensation and benefits when he left the company. But the fact that the SEC chose to charge him personally sends out a powerful signal.
re have been criticisms in some quarters that the ex-boss has not been properly held to account for his role in the affair. On this occasion, though, the finger has been pointed squarely in his direction.
On 29 October 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after taking off from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, killing all 189 passengers and crew.
Less than five months later, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, another Boeing 737 Max on its way to Kenya, crashed six minutes after leaving Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. All 157 people on board were killed.
rashes were linked to a flight control system called the ""Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System"" (MCAS) in the Boeing 737 Max.
SEC said that ""after the first crash, Boeing and Mr Muilenburg knew that MCAS posed an ongoing airplane safety issue, but assured the public that the 737 Max was safe to fly.
rashes have cost Boeing more than $20bn, including payments to families of those killed in the crashes.
In the wake of the incidents, the US Congress passed new legislation reforming how the country's aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), certifies new planes. 
A small number of trials are expected to start next year to resolve outstanding claims.

sports	Netball World Cup 2019: What's next for England?	"Record crowds watched Tracey Neville's England win their third successive World Cup bronze medal in Liverpool - but it was not the climax the Roses hoped for.
r third place play-off win came one year and three months after they shocked Australia - the most successful netball nation in the world - to win Commonwealth gold. 
As they leave Liverpool without the world title and with Neville leaving her role as head coach, what's next for this Roses team? 
Neville, 42, announced before the World Cup that she would be standing down to start a family.
former international, the sister of former footballers Phil and Gary Neville, was appointed in 2015, having coached domestic side Manchester Thunder for the previous four years.
She was tasked with turning around the fortunes of an England side who had finished fourth at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
She won two World Cup bronzes during her tenure, while also engineering Quad Series victories over Australia and New Zealand, but will forever be remembered as the coach that guided the team to a first major championship gold. 
So how do you fill those shoes?
England Netball chief executive Joanna Adams says she wants the next national coach to be British. It is understood four-time Superleague-winning coach and ex-England wing attack Tamsin Greenway is one of the front-runners for the job, although Adelaide Thunderbirds' Australian boss Tania Obst is also a leading contender.
""I think it's fine to get someone foreign in if they are the best person for the job but I can't think of anyone that would be better than what we've got here in England,"" said former Roses captain Sara Bayman, a BBC pundit.
""There is going to be such a big rebuilding process, so it's not necessarily about who comes in, but what they can offer.
""Tracey was a personality and did a lot for the image of the sport, but now it is very much about bringing in someone who is a developmental coach. It's a real grey area on what the job is.""
Momentum is key to growing a sport's popularity but there is a bit of a gap in netball's scheduling after the World Cup. The English domestic season does not start until January and the next major international event does not come until 2022 - at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games. 
""We have been building up the sport and we have a really strong Superleague and a quad series that keeps netball on the TV and at the forefront of people's minds,"" said England Netball chief executive Adams.
""We have surpassed Sydney [the 2015 World Cup hosts] in ticket sales and we want mums and daughters to love the sport and I think we have done that.""
m lining up to compete in Birmingham will look considerably different to the one who stepped on the podium on Sunday.
Four Commonwealth champions - defenders Geva Mentor, Eboni Usoro-Brown, centre-courter Jade Clarke and shooter Jo Harten - are all in their 30s, and are unlikely to make another major tournament. 
""Some of those players have been around this team for a long time and it's about whether they want to keep going,"" added Adams. 
""It's a tough sport but there is some great talent coming through. We didn't want the legacy of netball not to continue.""
England not winning gold on home soil could be seen as failure, but given the Roses' defeat by eventual champions New Zealand was their eighth semi-final loss in a row, was it a surprise?
Australian and Kiwis have contested every World Cup final since 1991, with the Diamonds winning 11 titles. 
But their dominance is under threat, according to England mid-courter Sasha Corbin.
""Australia have always been on the top,"" she said. ""No-one's ever seemed to take them on, especially for the past few World Cups. You can see how close netball is at the top level now.""

Four African nations finished in the top eight at the World Cup for the first time this year, and South Africa breaking into the top four shows nations are catching up.
So will it just be Australia challenging for New Zealand's World Cup crown in Cape Town in 2023?
""Everyone's getting closer,"" added Bayman. ""England's Commonwealth Games victory on the Gold Coast last year made other nations believe that they could do it. 
""We've seen South Africa in the top four for the first time in 24 years, we see a new world champion for the first time in 16 years. Things are changing in global netball and it's exciting to see.""

rent charity that runs it, as well as the Edinburgh International Film Festival and the Edinburgh Filmhouse, called in administrators.
More than 100 staff in total lost their jobs.
In Aberdeen, where 20 jobs went, it is hoped the venue can still be saved.
Centre for the Moving Image (CMI) was founded in 2010 and has run Belmont since 2014. 
On Thursday it said it had seen sharply rising costs alongside reduced trade due to the effects of the Covid pandemic.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs she was ""hugely concerned"" by the news. 
Charlotte Little from Aberdeen is visually and hearing impaired and works as an access consultant.
She said she was ""absolutely heartbroken and devastated"" at the news - for those losing their jobs, and for the loss of an important venue locally.
""It was a cinema space that made me feel so welcome and so valued as a disabled person that often found other cinemas really daunting,"" she told BBC Scotland.
""Belmont was the only place that I felt like if someone with both hearing loss and sight loss that I could go to not just with friends but by myself, because of the venue space and the staff, they were also so welcoming and eager to help however they could.
""And they would put on some many captioned screenings compared to the other cinemas and I needed that to really experience and enjoy movie-going.
""I called it my second home for many years.""
She said she hoped the Belmont could somehow be saved.
Aygul Salehova is a student who arrived from Azerbaijan a week ago to study film and visual culture at the University of Aberdeen.

""They have a cinema club, a lot of interesting films that we cannot see anywhere else, talks, conversations, discussions around films, film analysis.
""What are we going to do in Aberdeen to see good cinema? 
""Now that it's closed I don't know where the film students are going to gather to have high quality chats and discussions around films. 
""Commercial cinemas are a different thing. They show only very popular films, only mainstream. But what we believe is true cinema should be independent and Belmont was the place for that. ''

business	Energy bills: Half of UK households face fuel poverty, EDF warns	"EDF Energy boss Philippe Commaret warns without more help households face a tough winter
Half of UK households are facing fuel poverty this winter unless the government does more to help with energy bills, EDF has warned.
Philippe Commaret, a senior executive at EDF Energy UK, said without further support, people face a ""catastrophic winter"".
Energy bills are predicted to be nearly three times higher than last winter.
A household is considered to be in fuel poverty if it has to spend 10% or more of its income on energy.
From October, all UK households will start receiving payments providing a Â£400 discount on their fuel bills, with eight million low-income households set to receive an additional Â£650.
But the Liberal Democrats, Labour and most major energy suppliers are calling for further support for households, including for the energy price cap to be frozen at current levels.
government has said no further measures will be announced before a new prime minister is in place from 5 September.
Mr Commaret, EDF Energy UK's managing director for UK customers, told the BBC the current level of support was ""much too low"" and called for additional help to be provided, including short-term help with bills and longer-term solutions such as better insulation for homes.
EDF had seen a 30% rise in calls from customers under stress and struggling to pay their bills, he said.
""All ideas to keep bills for customers flat should be considered,"" Mr Commaret said.
""Without further support from the government, more than half of UK households will likely be in fuel poverty by January.""
""By way of context, I have to mention that we face, despite the support that the government [has] already announced, a dramatic and catastrophic winter for our customer,"" he said.
Energy bosses are becoming increasingly vocal with their ideas for staving off an energy price emergency.  
Keith Anderson, the boss of Scottish Power, is going to present his Â£100bn plan at a meeting with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon later. 
It's a scheme that he has already run past Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who is tipped to be the next chancellor if Liz Truss is prime minister. 
So how would it work? The plan would involve the government guaranteeing loans to the energy companies, enabling them to keep bills frozen while still forking out higher prices for wholesale gas. The so-called deficit fund would be repaid through bills over the next 20 or so years.  
Energy companies want to see more action on this. They are urging members of the next government to treat the energy crisis as it did the Covid pandemic, requiring similar levels of intervention. The furlough scheme, for example, paid the wages of 11 million people and cost around Â£70bn.  
On Friday, the new energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - will be announced.
for an average household is expected to rise to more than Â£3,500 from October, up from the current figure of Â£1,971.
Last winter, the typical bill for homes was Â£1,277.
A sharp rise in wholesale gas prices this week means bills are likely to rise even further next year, to as much as Â£4,650 from January.
On Monday the price of gas soared after Russia said it would close down a key pipeline for maintenance work. Experts fear the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which delivers Russian gas to Germany, may not reopen, making further price rises in the spring more likely.
But it is not just energy prices that are putting the squeeze on households. Overall, inflation reached 10.1% in July, pushed higher by rising food costs, especially for staples such as bread, milk, pasta and butter. Investment bank Citi predicts that inflation could pass 18% next year.
Mr Commaret said any customers concerned about their bill should contact EDF for further support.
Plans to enable households to get discounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak times are set to be announced by the National Grid in the next two weeks.
Mr Commaret said EDF was providing additional help and advice to its 3.4 million UK customers via an app to help customers identify ways to save fuel.
For example, he said UK households could save Â£60 a year by switching off appliances that were not being used.
EDF, which supplies gas and electricity to UK households, is 84% owned by the French state, but will soon be fully nationalised."	/news/business-62643934

Centrica's half-year profits were five times higher than a year earlier, while Shell reported record profits for the April-to-June period.
It comes as gas prices continue to rise, fuelled by the war in Ukraine.
ffecting households, with predictions that energy bills will rise even further next year.
government has said that every household in the UK will get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this autumn as part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices.
But there are calls for more action to help people now, including from personal finance expert Martin Lewis.
British Gas owner Centrica said adjusted operating profit for the six months ending in June rose to Â£1.34bn from Â£262m a year earlier.
rise in profits came from the company's nuclear and oil and gas business, rather than from the British Gas energy supply business which performed much worse. Many firms have been unable to fully pass on the rise in wholesale gas prices to customers. 
Centrica has brought back an interim dividend of 1p per share, after scrapping it for the past three years.
resume payouts to shareholders, even as UK households come under pressure from rising energy bills, has been criticised by some.
Energy analyst David Cox said people would ""react against"" the sight of an energy company rewarding shareholders, as households struggle with bills.
""Any oil and gas company... that's making a profit and giving some of that back to shareholders at this time, will face a backlash, particularly when we're seeing projections of energy bills hitting almost Â£4,000,"" he said.
Mr Cox, who used to work at British Gas, said that the firm had stopped paying a dividend over the past few years as it ""didn't have the money"" to do so. But it had since made profits in its oil and gas exploration operations, which is why it is re-introducing payouts.
""Businesses are there to make a profit, and dividends are one way of sharing that with shareholders,"" he said.
But Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea defended the decision and insisted a lot of the firm's profits were ""going back into society"".
""I know it's difficult to see the word profits, or dividends, or similar words when people are having a tough time. I'm very conscious of this,"" he said.
""Bear in mind, over the next couple of years we are expecting to pay a windfall tax of probably well over Â£600m on our UK gas business off the back of the profits that we're seeing, so a lot of this is going back into society.""
Energy giant Shell also reported strong results on Thursday, with second quarter profits of $11.5bn (Â£9bn).
mpany also announced another $6bn share buyback programme for the current quarter, on top of the $8.5bn of shares it bought back in the first half of 2022. But it did not raise its dividend of 25 cents per share.
Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said soaring profits from Centrica and Shell were ""an insult"" to people struggling to pay their energy bills.
""Energy bills are rising 23 times faster than wages. We need to hold down profits and boost wages,"" she said. ""Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history.""
Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said the profits reported by both Centrica and Shell would be ""greeted with disbelief"" by those facing ""rocketing energy prices"". 
""The government must impose a tougher windfall tax on energy firms. The bulk of these profits should be used to insulate our homes and help cash-strapped households pay for their heating this winter, rather than developing more fossil fuel projects that roast the planet.""
In May, the government announced a windfall tax on UK oil and gas firms that could raise about Â£5bn in the next 12 months.
Gas prices have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies, and wholesale prices have gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
UK energy bills increased by an unprecedented Â£700 in April and are likely to keep rising. One management consultancy, BFY, has warned that a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January, much higher than forecasts earlier this month.
BFY said its forecast reflected the increase in wholesale prices over the past few weeks with the ongoing tensions with Russia sparking concerns over winter supplies.
Many energy suppliers have gone bust over the past year, as they struggled to pass on soaring gas prices to customers. At least 30 energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August 2021.
British Gas said it added more than 200,000 customers in the first half of the year, including 158,000 customers that it picked up from failed supplier Together Energy."	/news/business-62330190
business	Humber ports traffic surpasses pre-pandemic levels - ABP	"rade through the Humber ports has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, in part due to hauliers seeking to avoid delays like those seen in Dover, bosses say.
Dafydd Williams, of Associated British Ports (ABP), said they were seeing ""really strong volumes of goods"" being moved through its terminals.
Speaking to BBC Radio Humberside, Mr Williams said the growth was ""possibly"" due to issues at other ports.
But he said recent investment had also made the ports more attractive.
Port of Dover saw long delays in the summer, due to post-Brexit border checks and amid claims of inadequate staffing from French border police.
""We are seeing some really strong volumes of goods coming through the Humber ports,"" Mr Williams said.
""We think it is possibly in part down to some challenges that other ports, like Dover, have faced where they saw delays. That may have fuelled some people's decision to use the Humber ports.
""But we think it is also because here in the Humber we offer a really good service.""
Mr Williams said ABP had invested Â£50m at its ports in Immingham and Hull, buying new cranes, increasing capacity and improving access to move lorries through the terminal quicker.
He added that the rise in traffic had so far not caused any disruption to the surrounding road network.
Asked if that might change with the planned imposition of additional checks of EU goods, he said two new border control posts had been built - one at Hull and one at Immingham - which should help avoid ""any significant delays or disruption"".
four ports in the Humber region - Hull, Goole, Grimsby and Immingham - take around 17% of the UK's trade, mostly destined for the North and Midlands, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
About 10% of the nation's energy supplies also come through the ports, as well as a quarter of all refined oil imported into the UK.

entertainment	BBC must do more to serve lower income audiences, says Ofcom	"BBC needs to do more to serve audiences on lower incomes, according to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom.
In its annual report, published on Wednesday, Ofcom said people in lower socio-economic groups are less engaged and less satisfied with the BBC.
It will launch an ""in-depth review"" next year into how the corporation connects with these audiences.
However, Ofcom said the BBC had fulfilled its remit, reaching a wide proportion of the UK population.
Eight out of 10 people aged 16 and over in the UK consume some BBC content each week.
Ofcom noted how during its transition to becoming a ""digital first"" organisation, the BBC faced many challenges.
""These include: protecting local audiences as it seeks to make changes to its news and current affairs; improving its complaints handling; and being more transparent about changes it intends to make to its licence-fee funded public services,"" it noted.
rporation recently announced that BBC local radio stations will have a significant number of programmes cut under new plans.
All 39 networks in England will keep their current schedule from 6am to 2pm, but after that shows will be shared.
Ofcom also said it had accepted a request from the BBC to increase its catalogue of older content and series on its iPlayer in order to give ""greater choice and better value for licence-fee payers"".
In response, a BBC spokeswoman noted how the watchdog ""recognises our investment in distinctive UK content"" and ""how we bring audiences together for major national moments"", as well as ""the significance of our trusted, impartial news, which means we're delivering on our remit and delivering value for audiences"".
She added: ""While the BBC is the most used media brand for lower socio-economic groups, we know we have further to go both on and off screen so we are commissioning ever more varied content that reflects UK communities and we've set a new staff target, for 25% of staff to come from lower socio-economic backgrounds to ensure we're serving all audiences.""
report arrives a day after the BBC announced changes to its complaints process, vowing to make it easier and more transparent.
rporation said on Tuesday that in order to ""maintain audience trust"" it would make its complaints website easier to find and use."	/news/entertainment-arts-63805821

Chuks Ifeajuma, from Hampshire, said he voted in favour of action by members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) because ""patients are at risk"".
RCN will strike on Thursday and 20 December at many NHS trusts in England, Northern Ireland and Wales.
Mr Ifeajuma said a substantial pay rise would improve patient care.
government has said the RCN's 19.2% pay claim is unaffordable and it has agreed to meet independent recommendations on pay.
Nurses will still provide emergency care, but routine services will be affected by the strikes.
Mr Ifeajuma, who asked the BBC not to disclose his place of work, said: ""We are campaigning to get better pay for staff to increase staffing levels. 
""So it's not just about the money, it's about the increase in staffing levels and patient care.
""You've got someone working really hard to protect the nation, to serve the people and at the end of the day they still go to the food bank to get food to eat or feed their family. I think that's a slap in the face.""

business	US economy adds more jobs than expected in June	"US economy created 372,000 jobs in June, according to official figures, with employment growing by far more than forecast.
Economists had expected the country to add between 250,000 and 295,000 roles.
unemployment rate also remained close to record lows, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
rong jobs figures are being seen by some analysts as a sign that more US interest rate rises could be on the way.
Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: ""Today's job number should soothe fears of an imminent recession, but it does nothing to relieve fears of considerable further Fed tightening.
""The job market remains severely tight, suggesting still-intense wage pressures.""
unemployment rate stayed at 3.6% in June for the fourth month in a row. 
Like other countries, the cost of living in the US is soaring due to rising food and energy prices. Inflation hit a 40-year high of 8.6% in the year to April and the US Federal Reserve has been increasing borrowing costs to try to cool the rate of  price growth.
Last month, the Fed announced its biggest interest rate rise in nearly 30 years, increasing its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
In the first three months of the year the US economy contracted at an annual pace of 1.6%, and Fed chairman Jay Powell recently admitted to lawmakers that a recession is ""a possibility"".
Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, said the ""strong jobs report contrasts with other recent economic announcements"".
""The US economy and the stock market have both struggled in the first half of 2022, in the face of risks that include a multi-decade high in inflation, aggressive monetary policy tightening, and the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, "" he said. 
""However, jobs reports are lagging economic indicators that are often strong entering a downturn."""	/news/business-62093303

technology	Cyber-attacks on small firms: The US economy's 'Achilles heel'?	"When Elana Graham started selling cyber-security software to small companies five years ago, business was relatively slow.
Now demand is booming, driven by a rapid expansion in remote work that has left small firms vulnerable to attack.
Business at her firm has tripled since the start of the year, she says, reaching an all-time high.
""It was a total head-in-the-sand situation. 'It's not going to happen to me. I'm too small.' That was the overwhelming message that I was hearing five years ago,"" says Ms Graham, co-founder of CYDEF, which is based in Canada. ""But yes, it is happening.""
Cyber-crimes are expected to cost the world $10.5tn (Â£9.3tn) by 2025, according to cyber-security research firm Cyber Ventures. 
On the current trajectory, small businesses will absorb most of the hit.
re three times more likely to be attacked by cyber-criminals compared to large businesses, cloud security firm Barracuda Networks has found. 
And the risks shot up during the pandemic.
Between 2020-21, cyber-attacks on small companies surged by more than 150%, according to RiskRecon, a Mastercard company that evaluates companies' cyber-security risk.
""The pandemic created a whole new set of challenges and small businesses weren't prepared,"" says Mary Ellen Seale, chief executive of the National Cybersecurity Society, a non-profit that helps small businesses create cyber-security plans. 
In March 2020, at the cusp of the pandemic, a survey of small businesses by broadcaster CNBC found that only 20% planned to invest in cyber-protection. 
Covid-19 lockdowns came into force and firms scrambled to move operations online. 
Working remotely meant more personal devices like smartphones, tablets and laptops had access to sensitive corporate information. However, lockdowns strained budgets, limiting how much companies could spend to protect themselves. Costly in-house experts and cyber-security software were often out of reach. 
result was weak cyber-security infrastructure that was ripe for hacking. 
""A lot of the attacks now are coming through them because bad guys know larger organisations have done a pretty good job of protecting their infrastructure. The weakest link is small businesses. And it's really easy to get in there,"" Ms Seale says.
If it's true to say the US is the engine of the world economy, then small and medium-sized businesses are the fuel that drives that engine.
Small businesses create nearly two-thirds of new jobs in the workforce and account for 44% of US economic activity. So what's the secret to their success? What challenges do they face and which are the best cities and regions for them to thrive?

For would-be criminals, such attacks are low risk and high reward, since they are less likely to catch the attention of authorities and often the companies themselves.
It typically takes 200 days from the moment of the hacking until discovery, says Yoohwan Kim, a computer science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In many cases, customer complaints are what alert companies to a problem.
And with one compromised supplier, criminals can access networks of organisations further up the supply chain.
""Large businesses depend on small businesses,"" says Ms Seale. ""They are the lifeblood of the United States, and we need a wake-up call.""
Small businesses account for more than 99% of companies in the US and employ nearly half of all Americans, playing a critical role in the global economy. 
Dr Kim says they are like the economy's ""Achilles heel"".
""They may be a small company but what they sell to large businesses could be very important. If they're hacked, [their product] won't be fed into supply chains and everything will be affected,"" says Dr Kim.
Cyber-attacks can be devastating to small businesses, prompting their products to be removed from supply chains and triggering legal fees, investigations and regulatory filings.
About 60% of small businesses shut down within six months of facing an attack, the National Cybersecurity Alliance estimates.
""The cost could reach thousands of dollars. Some companies simply can't pay that kind of money,"" Dr Kim says. ""They just can't handle it.""
But although small businesses are the most vulnerable, Ms Graham says that most cyber-security tools have been made for big companies, and are often difficult to understand and install without an in-house expert.
""That's a huge challenge for small companies that don't understand what these people are trying to sell them,"" she says.
Experts say there are simple steps small firms can take to improve their protections, such as creating basic response plans and identifying what and where critical data is.
Educating employees on how to avoid and detect attacks is also important, since the vast majority of data breaches involve human error.
Attacks in which cyber-criminals hacked into business emails were the costliest cyber-threat during the pandemic, amounting to $1.8bn in reported losses, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Also known as spear phishing, such hacks use a targeted attack, unlike more traditional strategies like spam, which reaches large numbers of people. Ms Graham describes the tool as ""the new frontier in criminal activity"" and says it has become the most common type of cyber-attack her clients face.
But firms should not despair, says Ms Seale.
""The biggest thing is to convey to small business that it's not hopeless. It's not an unsurmountable task,"" she says."	/news/business-63260648
politics	Mothers in Cambridge start campaign to support congestion charge	"A group of mothers have gathered together to support a controversial traffic scheme which could see a Cambridge congestion charge brought in.
Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP) is proposing a Â£5 charge to be introduced by 2026-27.
But it has sparked opposition from shopkeepers who fear it will hit trade.
Elisabeth Whitebread, from Parents for the Cambridge Sustainable Travel Zone, said it was fair that drivers pay for the pollution their car's produce.
group is holding a protest meeting at Parker's Piece in Cambridge city centre on Saturday, which was also the site of a demonstration against the charging plans in November.
rge would affect private vehicles across the whole city, including Addenbrooke's Hospital and the rest of the BioMedical Campus, between 07:00 and 19:00 on weekdays.
would also see Â£50m of investment to expand the bus network and improved walking and cycling routes.
Cambridgeshire County Council would have final approval of any plans.
Ms Whitebread told BBC Politics East: ""Cambridge is great place to raise children, but we need a transport system fit for the 21st Century.
""There are no easy answers to this sort of thing, and of cause the charges are going to come in, in a staggered way. There will be upfront investment before the charge comes in. 
""I do think it is fair that people who are driving and causing pollution and congestion are the ones who should pay for it. The council has signed up to a climate emergency so it is really time for them to 'walk the walk.'""
Elissa Meschini, Labour councillor and chair of the Greater Cambridge Partnership which is looking to put forward the plans, said:  ""We have to come clean about the challenges we face. All we ask at this point is that people appreciate the extent of the challenge we have to address. We haven't made a final decision and it's important people understand it isn't an easy solution.""
GCP said the scheme would cut the number of car trips in Cambridge by 50% .
John Whitelegg, a visiting professor at Liverpool John Moores University who has studied congestion charge schemes, said: ""I'm surprised to hear the 50% figure. 
""I think that might prove to be wildly out of line with the outcome.""
But Prof Whitelegg, who is a former Green Party spokesperson in sustainable transport, believed congestion charge schemes are the way forward, and people who originally oppose it will come around to supporting it in the end.
""There's a pattern. There is initial opposition, then reluctantly accepting the scheme is being done, and then really liking it and everyone finding the advantages of it,"" he said.
But the plans have provoked strong opposition.
Clare King, 64, who has lived in Cambridge for 30 years and drives across the city every day for her job in a supermarket, said: ""Rather than the 10 minute car journey, I would need to walk to a bus stop, wait for a bus, catch two buses, then get off a bus near work and then walk to work. 
""That journey would take me between 45 and 50 minutes, provided the buses came pretty quickly.
""We need to improve the buses. We don't need to do it through treating residents as cash cows.""
Neil Mackay's family has been running a hardware store in Cambridge for more than 100 years, selling items including heavy duty metal piping, tools, ladders, workwear and gardening equipment.
""The sorts of materials we supply. You can't take those on a bus,"" he said.
""If I was a tradesman coming into Cambridge and I wanted some materials and I had a choice between coming down to see my old friend Neil Mackay in East Road and paying Â£10, or going to an alternative supplier who might be outside the zone - of which there are plenty - who has similarly priced goods, which is he going to do?""

technology	Olly Stephens: Social media links to violence investigated	"Links between harmful social media content seen by children and serious violence have been underestimated, a report has found.
Criminal justice consultancy Crest Advisory has called for a safety rating system to limit children's access to social media content.
Its researchers worked with the parents of Olly Stephens who was murdered in Reading, Berkshire, last year. 
His father said he had been ""groomed, abused and murdered via social media"".
Olly's family have campaigned for stricter online laws to stop harmful content being shared after it transpired the attack on him was planned on 11 social media platforms.
A girl lured 13-year-old Olly out of his house, while the boys who murdered him waited in fields near his home to attack. Two boys, aged 14, were found guilty of his murder. 
report, entitled Fixing Neverland and funded by charity The Dawes Trust, found that young people are routinely exposed to videos of violent acts and adverts for weapons.
It said the technology sector and government organisations have had a ""collective blindspot"" about the relationship between social media and serious youth violence.
It concluded that social media can ""amplify"" conflict and ""accelerate"" its route towards violence. 
Olly's mother, Amanda Stephens, said the government should consider the report's findings for the stalled Online Safety Bill.
""Our children live in an online world that means danger is close, it's under your roof, it can attack them 24 hours a day, there is no respite from its harm.
""Social media companies must be held accountable for the safety of children using their apps,"" she said.
His father, Stuart Stephens, said: ""There's also an anger that these companies are getting away with it. They don't care.""
Key recommendations also included better education about social media as well as standardised age verification controls to make it much harder for children to view harmful material.
It called for a ""five star"" rating scale for social media platforms to indicate how safe they are for children, compiled by the communications watchdog, Ofcom.
Joe Caluori, Crest Advisory's head of research and policy, said children were spending increasing amounts of time in ""unregulated, unsupervised online spaces"".
""Our research shows that parents of primary school aged children are unprepared for the risks their children face online, including petty spats which are allowed to escalate quickly, resulting serious violence which causes life changing injuries and even death, as in the tragic case of Olly Stephens.""

politics	Child abuse survivors lose faith in redress payment scheme	"Some child abuse survivors say they have lost faith in the Scottish government's redress scheme.
gued by delays, failures and broken promises. 
mpensation scheme was set up last December to provide one-off payments for people abused as children in care. 
Scottish government says more than Â£8m has already been paid to survivors of historical abuse and more case workers have been recruited to improve the delivery of the scheme.
Rosie (not her real name) is a working mum who was sexually and emotionally abused by foster carers in East Lothian.
She applied for the Redress Scheme but she thought there would be more support for applicants.
""I thought it was quite difficult,"" she said.  ""I read a small amount in my records and it took me three months to heal from what I'd read.""
Rosie employed a lawyer because the bureaucracy was too difficult for her to deal with emotionally. 
She said the scheme should be quick and compassionate but she found it a ""long and difficult"" process.
She added: ""It's not acceptable for survivors to have to keep reliving their trauma because a public body can't get their skates on and fix things.""
Scotland's Redress Scheme was set up to recognise and acknowledge survivors of historical abuse in care.
It compensates people abused before 1 December 2004 who were under the age of 18 at the time.
As of 30 October, 277 applications have been passed to Redress Scotland for consideration and of those 178 have had a payment.
In total Â£8.57m has been paid to abuse survivors. 
Simon Collins is solicitor for the In Care Abuse Survivors (INCAS) group.
He urged survivors not to turn their backs on the scheme.
He said: ""I'm aware there are delays that have been entirely unacceptable over the period, some survivors have waited 10, 11 months.""
But Mr Collins said he has recently begun to see an increased number of payments.
He added: ""That's very positive because you get the acknowledgement to the survivors, the payment of the redress which, because of the involvement of the government scheme, goes 100 per cent to the survivors, there's no deduction from the fees.
""That positive outcome should be borne in mind.""
Kim Leslie is a partner at Digby Brown Solicitors who have also represented some applicants for the scheme.
She said people are getting put off by delays, a lack of communication and an overly complicated process.
""A survivor has a short window of tolerance for let down,"" she added. ""There is a big difference between what was promised and what is being delivered. 
""So my advice would be to get round the table now and try and implement immediate improvements to make this meet the needs of survivors.""
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government had increased staff numbers working on Redress Scotland due to the ""very high number of applications"". 
He said: ""We're taking care to work our way through those applications in an empathetic manner, to support individuals and get them the answers that they deserve.
""This will be painful process for survivors because it requires them to revisit, to some extent, the horrors of the abuse that they have suffered.""
me was launched after the Redress for Survivors (Historical Child Abuse in Care) (Scotland) Act 2021 received Royal Assent in April last year.
Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry, set up in 2015, is currently examining the abuse of children in care in Scotland.
A restriction order issued by the chair of the inquiry prevents applicants from using their inquiry statement as part of their application - it operates independently of the government.
A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""Scotland's Redress Scheme is designed to be swifter and less adversarial than civil court action, and the number of applications received to date is in line with projections. 
""More than Â£8 million has already been paid out to survivors in less than one year of the scheme being in operation, with 8% of applicants having requested a review out of 189 payment offers.
""As each application is unique to an individual's experience it is not possible to determine an average timescale however priority is given to applicants with a terminal illness and those over 68 years of age.""
Scottish government said that following feedback from survivors the operating model for the Redress Scheme has been improved and that additional case workers have been recruited.
It said practical and emotional support was available to applicants at each stage of the process."	/news/uk-scotland-63648390
sports	Pele: My memories of meeting a football legend	"The last time I saw Pele in person he was behind the counter of a Subway branch in Central London, struggling to fit the salad fillings into a sandwich.
It was March 2015, and no, the Brazilian football legend had not fallen on hard times - it was a publicity stunt courtesy of the US fast food company, with whom the man known as King Pele to his fellow countrymen had one of his many post-career endorsement deals.
By then Pele and I had already met a bunch of times, which was enough to trigger a wide smile when he clocked me among the scrum of journalists. I was fortunate enough to secure a one-to-one interview, but my happiest memory of that afternoon was that Pele looked fit and healthy at the age of 74. 
""You had everyone worried with that hospital business, King,"" I told him. 
""Did you forget I was born in the town of Tres Coracoes (Three Hearts in Portuguese)? It's difficult to put someone who has 'three hearts' in the ground,"" he answered, with a laugh. 
A year earlier, he had looked so frail during his appearance at football governing body Fifa's awards ceremony in Zurich that, like many other Brazilian journalists, I was genuinely worried he wasn't going to be around for much longer.
As it turned out, Pele was already battling kidney problems, which were aggravated by the fact he had actually lost a kidney in the 1970s, damaged by the battering dispensed by opponents throughout his 21-year professional career.
Every time that our paths crossed, I would spend the following days wondering what had just happened. It was like being in the presence of one of the Avengers - one who always seemed happy to see you. 
For many football fans, and Brazilians especially, the man born as Edson Arantes do Nascimento was superhuman - simply the greatest player to have ever kicked a ball. 
Just like John Lennon once said that 'rock and roll' should have been called 'Chuck Berry' for his influence on the musical genre, football should have been dubbed 'Pele'. 
He is still the only person to have won three Fifa World Cups as a player and he was only 17 when Brazil first lifted the trophy in 1958.
welve years later, he was part of a Brazil side that won the title in Mexico with such flair that it still wins polls for the best team ever assembled. 
One of the best compliments to Pele's performance in that tournament came from Italy's Tarcisio Burgnich, the defender charged with man-marking the Brazilian in the final.
""I told myself before the game, 'he's made of skin and bones, just like everyone else'. But I was wrong.""
Pele scored one and set up two more in that game, as Brazil won their - and his - third World Cup. That goal was one of more than 1,200 that he would score in his career.
Pele left an impression that transcended the game and led Andy Warhol, the late US artist, to amend his famous quote about the transient nature of fame.
""Pele was one of the few who contradicted my theory: instead of 15 minutes of fame, he will have 15 centuries,"" Warhol predicted.
Pele the player had already retired from international duty before I was born in 1973, but growing up in Brazil made it impossible to escape hearing over and over again tales of his feats.
But in addition to helping Brazil become the world's most successful footballing country, Pele, a black man, did something even more significant: he rose to the status of national treasure in a land with a shameful past of slavery and a legacy of segregation that persists to these days. 
He was and still is the most famous Brazilian. Everywhere I have travelled - from New York to sub-Saharan Africa - his is the first name anyone mentions after I tell them where I am from. 
Pele, of course, also had his critics. There were those who thought he should have spoken out against the military regime that ruled Brazil with an iron fist between 1964 and 1985 and whose leaders were not shy of piggybacking on the success of the national team.
Pele wasn't the only one his peers who appeared to have turned a blind eye to the repression, but none of them had his charisma.
In a 2021 Netflix documentary, Pele said, in an apologetic tone, that ""footballers wouldn't have made a difference"" to the human rights violations that took place during the years of military rule.
""If I said I didn't know about [the violations], I'd be lying. But we weren't sure of what was happening.""
In later years, Pele would claim that he refused to come back from international retirement to play the 1974 World Cup in protest against the military.
Neither did Pele actively engage with more formal efforts against racism in Brazil, whether in his playing days or after retiring. 
In 2014, he was heavily criticised after appearing to normalise a racist incident in a Brazilian Championship game by saying that he had suffered enough racial abuse in his playing days to ""stop every game I have ever taken part in"". 
Pele's personal life was also marked by controversy - the arrest of his son, Edson, for involvement in drug trafficking, and his refusal to acknowledge Sandra, a daughter born after an affair in the early 1960s. 
In the Netflix documentary, Pele admitted having ""so many affairs that he didn't know how many kids I had"".
Pele hung his boots up for good in 1977 after a stint in the US' ill-fated first professional football league. 
He never went into management and his involvement with the game was largely limited to stints in TV punditry - the scenes of him jumping up and down still wearing his headset in the press box of the Rose Bowl stadium in Los Angeles when Brazil won the 1994 Men's World Cup still bring a tear to my eyes.
He would also appear in soap operas and movies like Escape to Victory and even served as Brazil's Minister for Sport between 1995-98.
Pele endorsed a myriad of national and international companies, which sometimes led to mockery, like when we advertised medicine for erectile dysfunction in the 2000s - although in hindsight it was perhaps a brave move. 
Pele was a go-to source for quotes for national and international media - he never really measured his words much, even if it meant upsetting famous colleagues. 
Brazil's World Cup winning forward Romario once said that ""Pele is a poet with his mouth shut"".
He also could make way off mark predictions. 
It was Pele who predicted in the 1970s that an African team ""would win the World Cup before the 21st Century"". 
He also famously tipped Colombia to win the 1994 World Cup after the South American nation spectacularly demolished Argentina to qualify for the tournament - they were knocked out in the first round after losing to the US. 
But he rolled with the punches.
""I think my history in the game gives me a right to speak my mind,"" he told me in Berlin in 2006, in another surreal moment in which I found myself in a luxury hotel suite with him and his staff watching England's World Cup round of 16 match against Ecuador.
fternoon, he launched into a full-blown rant against everything and everyone who, in his opinion, was unfairly criticising him - including a certain Diego Maradona. It was pure gold for a bombastic article, but unfortunately one that would never see the light of day - the King had already made it clear: ""You are here as a friend, not as a journalist"".
Who was I to go against royalty? But when Brazil got knocked out by France in the quarter-finals of that tournament, Pele's only newspaper interview reacting to the result was given to me.
Since the incredible arrival of Lionel Messi on the scene, many have been tempted to claim Pele had been toppled as the world's best ever footballer. Not in the Brazilian legend's opinion.
""I could score headers and kick with both feet, while Messi tends to use his left much more. He also needs to score a thousand goals,"" Pele told me in London. 
I wish I had the chance to tell Pele one more time in person that the Argentine was also still lacking three World Cup trophies.

politics	Minister Lee Waters calls female opponent's remarks hysterical	"A minister has been told off for accusing a female politician of making ""hysterical"" comments in the Senedd.
Lee Waters said Tory Member of the Senedd Natasha Asghar had thrown ""hysterical labels"" at him, after she said he was ""punishing drivers"".
Presiding Officer Elin Jones said there was a long history of the term ""being used by men to demean women"". 
She said it was an ""inappropriate word"" to use to describe any contribution by any woman in the Senedd.
Ms Jones said the deputy transport minister may have used the term ""naively"" but ""I don't expect to hear it again"".
Ms Asghar, MS South Wales East, had criticised Mr Waters for confirming in a television interview that motorists should expect to see road charges introduced in the future. 
She said: ""People across the country are struggling to make ends meet with the rising cost-of-living pressures, whilst at the same time you are drawing up plans to squeeze even more cash out of them. 
""Deputy minister, will you finally stop punishing drivers at every available opportunity and go back to the drawing board and re-think your 50 mph and road charge plans?""
Responding, Mr Waters said: ""By definition, the [UK] Treasury's reliance on fuel duty to fund large parts of public services will have to be reassessed because people won't be buying petrol. 
""So, some of form of road user charging is inevitable, and is, in fact, being actively worked on by her [Conservative] government in London. 
""So, whenever she comes up with hysterical labels to throw at me, she really needs to think beyond the soundbite to what she's saying, because this is something all governments are doing, because, simply, the rules are changing.""

Mr Price promised to ask all party staff to share their experiences and said he would learn from them.
But he declined to comment on claims he knew of allegations against a party Senedd member a year ago.
Several sources have said there is substantial unease within the party about the way allegations have been dealt with.
Welsh Parliament's Standards Commissioner is investigating serious allegations made against Rhys ab Owen, MS for South Wales central.
Mr ab Owen is suspended in the meantime. Sources have claimed the allegations were in raised in Plaid a year ago.
BBC Wales also learned earlier this week the party has also commissioned a HR firm to look into misconduct allegations in Plaid Cymru, unrelated to Rhys ab Owen.
One source spoke of an ""awful culture"" in the party and a ""lack of leadership"".
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Drive with Gareth Lewis, Mr Price said: ""I've made it very clear that Plaid Cymru, like all parties, has to work to improve its culture and ensure that it has a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.
""I'm concerned to read this and we're committed to ensuring that we do practice those values of inclusivity and creating a safe space.
""As a result of these comments, we will be reaching out to all our staff, giving them a space to share their experiences confidentially.

health	Industrial action by health workers in NI begins	"Healthcare workers from two of Northern Ireland's biggest unions have begun industrial action in a dispute about pay.
Nipsa members started ""indefinite action short of strike"" on Monday.
Unison members are taking similar action on Monday and will follow that with a one-day strike on 12 December.
unions announced their action after the Royal College of Nursing said its members would strike on 15 and 20 December.
Nipsa members are taking the action over three issues: pay, staffing levels within the health service and travel reimbursement.
Unison's action is over pay for its members.
Health workers in Northern Ireland have yet to receive an increase in pay for the 2022-23 financial year.
In July an independent pay review body recommended that they should receive a rise of Â£1,400.
Unison representative Anne Speed told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme the union was seeking an ""inflation-busting pay rise"" for its members.
""What it means is inflation is 11%, and a pay rise actually has to match that in order to protect workers,"" she said.
""What's being awarded is only half of inflation, and health workers are just frustrated, fed up, very disappointed and they're choosing to speak out now.""
Ms Speed added that unions were prepared to negotiate, but the responsibility fell on Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, due political stalemate at Stormont.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew from the executive earlier this year in protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit deal.
In England and Wales, NHS staff have been given a rise of at least Â£1,400.
Unions in Scotland are considering a government offer averaging 7.5%.
re are several reasons why workers are taking industrial action, including the failure by the Stormont executive to trigger a pay increase while the cost of living soars.
Workers in the Unison and Nipsa unions want staff shortages addressed and feel their efforts during the pandemic should be recognised financially.
It will take a lot to resolve the industrial dispute.
But the unions say that for starters, in the absence of devolved government, civil servants could agree to pay workers the recommended rate that has been granted elsewhere.
Nipsa and Unison action will take the form of work to rule - members will only take on work required in their contracts.
Nipsa deputy general secretary PÃ¡draig Mulholland said those who were taking the action were the ""heroes who brought us through Covid and are now standing up for the health service"".
He said that during the action members would:
Unison said its members were frustrated and angry and ""are now the lowest paid part of the UK NHS workforce"".
union said the cost-of-living crisis was biting deep and it was foolish to assume workers would ""suck it up"".
Regarding the strike planned for 12 December, Unison said employers would be advised in the coming days of the full scope of the action.
In a joint statement the unions said the safety of health service patients was ""very important for health staff who will take industrial action"".
""Discussions have already begun to ensure the employers take the necessary steps to protect patients during the dispute,"" they said.
Stormont's Department of Health said the health authorities would work to protect critical services as much as possible during the industrial action.
But it warned that there would ""inevitably be an impact on patient care"".

sports	Winter Olympics: Norway win record 15th gold as Johannes Thingnes Bo takes biathlon victory	"Johannes Thingnes Bo steered Norway to Winter Olympic history as they won a record-breaking 15th gold in Beijing.
Bo's victory in the men's mass start biathlon was his fourth gold of the Games, and his fifth medal overall.
His country's tally surpassed the previous best at a Winter Games of 14, first achieved by Canada in 2010.
Norway's Marte Olsbu Roiseland, meanwhile, has become the first person to win a medal in all four individual biathlon events at a Winter Games.
Roiseland took bronze in the women's mass start biathlon, to add to the gold she earned in the sprint and pursuit biathlon events, and bronze in the individual.
31-year-old also won gold in the mixed relay, meaning she is the first woman to win five biathlon medals in a single Winter Games.

health	Superbug fight 'needs farmers to reduce antibiotic use'	"Health and animal welfare campaigners concerned about the spread of superbugs in humans are calling for a ban on the overuse of antibiotics in farm animals.
routinely using antibiotics in livestock can lead to bacteria becoming resistant and such 'superbugs' could spread to humans.
Sample tests they carried out in rivers near farms, in slurry and in chicken litter found resistant bacteria.
government said it is considering new restrictions on antibiotic use.
A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said: ""We do not support routine preventative use of antibiotics in animals - they should not compensate for poor husbandry practices and we will continue to look into strengthening legislation in this area.""
National Farmers Union said UK farming was ""a leader when it comes to the responsible use of antibiotics"". 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been described by the World Health Organisation as ""one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.""
ruse of antibiotics, in both human medicine and agriculture, has seen them become less effective and led to the rise of 'superbugs' - strains of bacteria that can no longer be treated by certain drugs.
ublished by the UK Health Security Agency shows that the estimated total number of serious antibiotic resistant infections in England rose by 2.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, from 52,842 to 53,985.
Researchers for the Alliance to Save our Antibiotics and World Animal Protection carried out tests for superbugs in rivers alongside a dozen intensive and higher-welfare pig and poultry farms in Warwickshire, Herefordshire, Devon, Norfolk and the Wye Valley and in the slurry from four intensive dairy farms and in one chicken litter sample.
found a range of antibiotic-resistant genes and resistant strains of bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).
gher levels of at least one type of resistance were found downstream of five of out eight intensive farms. None of the four higher welfare outdoor pig or chicken farms tested had higher levels of any type of resistance downstream than was found upstream, according to the report.
""Overall, our findings suggest that factory farms are likely to be discharging resistance genes and superbugs into public waterways,"" concluded the report, which was drawn up with Fera Science and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.
Intensive 'factory' farming methods have been blamed for contributing to the rise in AMR, with claims that a high number of animals kept closely together can be a breeding ground for disease and can lead to antibiotics being given to whole herds or flocks simply to keep illness at bay.
CÃ³ilÃ­n Nunan, scientific adviser to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, said that higher-welfare farming methods were needed to keep the risk of illness and antibiotic use down.
""Most antibiotics taken by people or animals are excreted, along with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. When manure or slurry is spread on land, this increases the number of resistant bacteria in soils and water,"" he said.
""The best way to reduce farming's impact is to make large cuts to antibiotic use, and this means keeping animals in healthier conditions so they rarely need medication."" 
Professor Isabelle Durance, director of the Cardiff Water Research Institute, who was not involved in the study, told the BBC it was accepted that faecal matter entering water bodies can carry with it drug-resistant bacteria and genes, and that could come from farming.
""We know that with faecal material from agricultural production, there is an amount that enters wastewater. You can have perfectly healthy chickens with bacteria that have antimicrobial resistance. As soon as there is faecal material in water bodies there will be anti-microbial resistant bacteria,"" she explained.
But she warned it was ""extremely difficult"" to link the bacteria in rivers to a specific source.
Peter Greig, the co-founder of Pipers Farm, oversees 45 higher-welfare outdoor farms across Somerset, Devon, Cornwall, Wales and East Anglia which, he says, only use antibiotics when sick animals are in need and not as a routine preventative measure.
Mr Greig said he was not surprised by the report's findings: ""It's a no-brainer. The excreta which comes out of an industrial pig or poultry environment is then spread so that it feeds into the groundwater and into the rivers. That causes a major disruption to the balance of nature.""
In January, the EU banned all routine farm antibiotic use and all preventative antibiotic treatments of groups of animals in order to tackle the overuse, and inappropriate use, of the medicines.
government had supported a ban in 2018 but has yet to carry out the public consultation it said it would.
Defra said proposed changes to existing regulations on antibiotic use on farms would be put out for public consultation ""in due course"". 
Meanwhile, the latest annual UK Veterinary Antibiotic Resistance and Sales Surveillance (UK-VARSS) report, published earlier this month, showed sales of antibiotics for use in livestock had reduced by 55% since 2014.
Cat McLaughlin, of The Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture (RUMA) Alliance, said livestock farmers were continuing to ""make positive progress on antibiotic use reduction targets"". 
But she added: ""We must remember that antibiotics are important tools that the veterinary sector needs at its disposal to protect animal health and welfare against disease challenges.'"	/news/science-environment-63666024

technology	Cost of living: Inside the 'foodbank' for data	"With inflation rising to record levels, many people are facing a hard choice: either pay for online access or use the money for essentials like food or heating. BBC Technology reporter Chris Vallance hears from users of one service designed to combat data poverty.
As prices have risen, Lewa and her family have needed to make savings -  she cut back on food but also data: ""Sometimes I would share my internet with my neighbour using her internet,""  she says.
Money was scarce even before the cost of living crisis: ""I lost my husband three years ago. And financially everything became really hard. I've been struggling with three kids, all at different stages. One of them is eight, one is 12 and one of them's 19.
""I remember my son used to go to do his homework at the library. And he he was spending so much time there just because of the internet.""
Lewa - who did not wish the BBC to use her last name - says many people she knows face similar choices, but she has now found help.
National Databank, an organisation founded by Virgin Media O2 and digital inclusion charity the Good Things Foundation, describes itself as like a foodbank  - but for free mobile data, texts and calls.
A donation from Virgin Media O2 - timed to coincide with the databank's first anniversary - means people can now get 20GB of data per month.
About 400 community organisations and groups that work with the Good Things Foundation, can request donations of mobile data - in the form of SIM cards or O2 vouchers - from the databank for the people they support.
Lewa told me that without this help she doesn't know how she would have been able to afford data.
Hafsha Dadabhai Shaikh, who works to help people access free data from the databank, says Lewa's story is typical: ""People out there are making those choices between 'do I have enough money to feed myself and my family this month?...and do I have enough money left over to put in the kitty to buy some data'?"" 
She says data is essential: ""Families are having to go online to see their GPs, order prescriptions, make financial choices as well. Some of the big supermarkets, they all have online loyalty cards, and you need to go online to find the better deals.""
Lewa agrees data is essential, as managing Universal Credit, doctor appointments and prescriptions are all most easily accessed via the internet. Her eldest son recently found a job, and that was through the internet.
general pinch on people's finances as food and energy costs increase, has also fed into big rises in inflation-linked bills from many of the big telecommunications firms.
Some mobile and broadband packages linked to inflation have seen mid-contract increases of as much as 11%, according to price comparison site Uswitch - although these increases only affect some customers. For others, experts say, bills have remained fairly stable.
Ofcom has previously estimated that 1.1 million households are ""struggling to afford their home broadband service"". And a recent survey of 4,000 adults on low incomes, by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, suggested that 7% are in arrears on their internet bills, owing an average of Â£171. 
At a meeting last month at Number 10, attended by the culture secretary Nadine Dorries and the heads of the big broadband and mobile firms, the government says it secured ""strong commitments from broadband and mobile companies to help families worried about bills to stay connected"".
Mark Jackson of ISPReview- a news site which covers internet connectivity - said of the pledges: ""None of this seems particularly new, with most of those same providers already saying they were doing much or all of this"".
government maintains its negotiations have resulted in a range of social tariffs available ""across 99 per cent of the country"".
Social tariffs - low-cost deals which most firms offer to low-income households - can significantly reduce bills. 
But in a letter to broadband suppliers in April, Ms Dorries noted that only 1-2% of Universal Credit claimants take up social tariffs. She called on firms to do more to promote them.
Back at the Databank, Lewa hadn't heard of social tariffs. Ms Dadabhai Shaikh agreed they are not well known. She speculates that ""people don't know about them because most of this information is probably online"".
In fact, communications regulator Ofcom does maintain an online list of firms offering social tariffs - some of the big firms would prefer to be told if a customer is claiming benefits, so these tariffs can be offered automatically. "	/news/technology-61974877

Hazara community lives in isolated ghettos in the city, cordoned off by checkpoints. For many Hazara women karate is a way of fighting back and breaking out of the restrictions they face.

politics	Political parties want to appear tough on immigration but numbers tell different story	"In recent days, the prime minister has said immigration should fall. 
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK's ""immigration dependency"", as he put it, must end.
Even if, in an interview I did with him, he wasn't willing to explicitly say he wanted the numbers to fall.
Sir Keir Starmer says he will not pick ""arbitrary migration targets"" over the number of workers coming to the UK from abroad
And then there are these latest figures. Half a million more people arriving in the UK than leaving in the year to June. Half a million. The highest ever.
ke a step back from the political argument here, and this is an outwardly flattering scenario. A country whose magnetism to so many propels people to our shores in such numbers.
Whatever their circumstances or background, half a million more people concluding their hopes and dreams are better served by moving to the UK than by leaving.
And yet, as so often with the question of immigration, it creates a cascade of political and societal quandaries. 
Opinion polls suggest concerns about immigration eased after the Brexit referendum, but it remains a significant worry for many. 
Not on the scale of the cost of living, the economy or the health service. But important nonetheless.
And none of these issues exist in isolation.
Migration has an impact on these issues too.
It's worth remembering, by the way, that not all political leaders express a desire for the numbers to shrivel. Take the Scottish National Party, for instance, which advocates more immigration.
But for those that do talk about, or at least hint at reducing the numbers, actually delivering that requires difficult decisions. Should fewer international students be allowed in? What about fewer people coming to the UK to work in the NHS? And at what consequence? 
But what too could be the consequence of political rhetoric and observable reality being so out of step, as a swelling population heaps further pressure on school places, the health service and housing?
Almost instantly, the former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage branded it a disgrace, and said that Reform UK, the successor to the Brexit Party, would field candidates everywhere at the next general election.
Let's see.
One recent opinion poll from Deltapoll does suggest that among Conservative-leaning, Leave-backing voters, asylum and immigration is hugely, hugely important.
So how do those voters, many of whom perhaps backed Leave expecting immigration to fall, respond? 
Who do they blame? And where do they turn? And what do the Conservatives and Labour say now?
Home Secretary Suella Braverman said ""we remain committed to reducing migration over time, in line with our manifesto commitment"".
You may remember the Conservatives long promised to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, and it never happened.
Labour said there had been Conservative ""mismanagement"" of the asylum and immigration systems. But they themselves have shifted their frontbench view a million miles from where it was. They want to appear robust on immigration.
But can both big parties at Westminster continue saying this stuff with any credibility if the numbers tell a different story?"	/news/uk-politics-63751867

entertainment	Banksy accuses clothing brand Guess of 'helping themselves' to his artworks	"Banksy has hit out at clothes retailer Guess, claiming the company has used his designs without permission.
graffiti artist posted a photo of the Regent Street store in London, and suggested shoplifters should visit.
He wrote on Instagram: ""They've helped themselves to my artwork without asking, how can it be wrong for you to do the same to their clothes?""
featured Banksy's Flower Thrower graffiti plus clothes bearing his images. Guess has not commented.
US clothing brand has advertised a new collection ""with graffiti by Banksy"".
mpany said the collection was created in collaboration with Brandalised, which licenses designs by graffiti artists.
After the artist posted his message encouraging shoplifting, a criminal offence, Guess closed the store to the public, placed security outside and covered up the window display. Staff in the shop declined to speak to the BBC.
Speaking last month about the collection, Guess chief creative officer Paul Marciano said: ""The graffiti of Banksy has had a phenomenal influence that resonates throughout popular culture.
""This new capsule collection with Brandalised is a way for fashion to show its gratitude.""
Copyright lawyer Liz Ward, founder of Virtuoso Legal, said Guess ""appear to have legitimately sourced the Banksy artwork via a third party, namely Brandalised, who say they have rights to commercialise and use Banksy's artwork on goods"".
She said: ""It isn't known if Banksy approved or even knew about this deal. If he did know about it, then perhaps his comments are there to create some kind of guerrilla marketing campaign. If he didn't know about it, then he must be quite annoyed, especially as such mainstream companies and brands don't accord with his anti-establishment views.
""The short point is that Banksy should be pursing Brandalised and or Guess for infringement of his work. However, given she/he wants to remain anonymous, that may well be impossible.""
Copyright infringement is ""extremely serious and can cause long term commercial damage"", but is normally a civil offence, she added - whereas shoplifting is a criminal offence. 
""Whatever the rights and wrongs of this, it isn't right to encourage shoplifting per se.""
Banksy's representatives declined to comment further, while Brandalised has also not commented.
Earlier this week, Banksy won an appeal to allow him to keep the trademark of one of his most famous images, a monkey wearing a sandwich board, at the EU Intellectual Property Office.
He also revealed on Thursday that he had visited Ukraine to create seven new pieces.
His artwork included a woman in rollers and a gas mask holding a fire extinguisher, and a Vladimir Putin lookalike being thrown to the floor by a child in a judo match. "	/news/entertainment-arts-63682298
health	West Midlands nurses join nationwide strike	"West Midlands nurses walk out in dispute over pay and conditions
Nurses across the West Midlands joined tens of thousands of others across the country for a 12-hour walk-out over pay.
Among them was Shelley Harwood, a nurse for 17 years at Worcestershire Royal Hospital, who said ""pay and conditions are not reflective of the duties"". Others cited cost-of-living concerns.
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is calling for a 19% pay rise.
government says the demand is unaffordable.
Many of those who took part in the walk-out in freezing temperatures said they were struggling due to the rising cost of domestic bills.
Lee Samson, who stood in front of the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire, said: ""We are trying to do extra hours to make ends meet.""
Mr Samson told BBC Radio Hereford and Worcester many nurses had turned to foodbanks for support.
""We just feel we need more of a pay rise to help us with the standards of living,"" he said.
Heather Smith was due to have an operation on Thursday after finding a lump on her breast and said she was ""in tears"" when it was cancelled because of the industrial action.
She said: ""You get yourself all psyched up for something, right this is it, let's go and get it done.""
Speaking to BBC Breakfast earlier, health minister Maria Caulfield said she accepted ""it is difficult"" living on a nurse's wage, but a 19% pay rise was unrealistic.
Dozens of nurses, many holding placards, gathered on the picket line outside Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.
RCN's Lindsey Meeks said: ""We've got our student nurses who can't afford to nurse who are leaving [the profession].""
RCN head Pat Cullen described the situation as a tragedy, and apologised to patients for the disruption to their care. 
Worcestershire Health and Care Trust said minor injury units in Malvern and Tenbury had been closed due to staffing pressures.
Units in Bromsgrove and Evesham remained open, it added.

technology	Inside a US military cyber teamâs defence of Ukraine	"Russia failed to take down Ukrainian computer systems with a massive cyber-attack when it invaded this year, despite many analysts' predictions. The work of a little-known arm of the US military which hunts for adversaries online may be one reason. The BBC was given exclusive access to the cyber-operators involved in these global missions.
In early December last year, a small US military team led by a young major arrived in Ukraine on a reconnaissance trip ahead of a larger deployment. But the major quickly reported that she needed to stay.  
""Within a week we had the whole team there ready to go hunting,"" one of the team recalls. 
me to detect Russians online and their Ukrainian partners made it clear they needed to start work straight away. 
""She looked at the situation and told me the team wouldn't leave,"" Maj Gen William J Hartman, who heads the US Cyber National Mission Force, told the BBC. 
""We almost immediately got the feedback that 'it's different in Ukraine right now'. We didn't redeploy the team, we reinforced the team.""
Since 2014, Ukraine has witnessed some of the world's most significant cyber-attacks, including the first in which a power station was switched off remotely in the dead of winter. 
By late last year, Western intelligence officials were watching Russian military preparations and growing increasingly concerned that a new blizzard of cyber-attacks would accompany an invasion, crippling communications, power, banking and government services, to pave the way for the seizure of power. 
US military Cyber Command wanted to discover whether Russian hackers had already infiltrated Ukrainian systems, hiding deep inside. Within two weeks, their mission became one of its largest deployments with around 40 personnel from across US armed services.
In January they had a front-row seat as Russia began paving the way in cyberspace for a coming invasion in which Ukraine's cyber-defences would be put to an unprecedented test. 
filtration of computer networks had for many years been primarily about espionage - stealing secrets - but recently has been increasingly militarised and linked to more destructive activities like sabotage or preparation for war. 
means a new role for the US military, whose teams are engaged in ""Hunt Forward"" missions, scouring the computer networks of partner countries for signs of penetration. 
""They are hunters and they know the behaviour of their 'prey',"" explains the operator who leads defensive work against Russia. 
US military asked for some operators to remain anonymous and others to be identified only by their first names due to security concerns.
Since 2018, US military operators have been deployed to 20 countries, usually close allies, in Europe, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific region. - although not countries like the UK, Germany or France, which have their own expertise and are less likely to need or want outside help. 
Most of their work has been battling state-hackers from China and North Korea but Russia has been their most persistent adversary. Some countries have seen multiple deployments, including Ukraine, where for the first time cyber attacks were combined with a full-scale war.
Inviting the US military into your country can be sensitive and even controversial domestically, so many partners ask that the US presence remains secret - the teams rarely wear uniform. But increasingly, governments are choosing to make missions public.
In May, Lithuania confirmed a three-month deployment had just finished working on its defence and foreign affairs networks, prioritised because of concerns over threats from Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. 
Croatia hosted the most recent deployment. ""The hunt was thorough and successful, and we discovered and prevented malicious attacks on Croatian state infrastructure,"" Daniel MarkiÄ, the head of the country's security and intelligence agency, says.
""We were able to offer the US a new 'hunting ground' for malicious actors and share our experience and acquired knowledge,"" he adds.
But warm public statements mask the reality that these missions often begin uneasily. 
Even countries allied to the US can be nervous about allowing the US to root around inside sensitive government networks. In fact, revelations from former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden 10 years ago suggested that the US spied on friends as well as enemies.
uspicion means the young men and women arriving on a mission are often faced with a stern test of their diplomatic skills. They show up at an airport hauling dozens of boxes of mysterious technical equipment and need to quickly build trust to get permission to do something sensitive - install that equipment on the host country's government computer networks to scan for threats. 
""That is a pretty scary proposition if you're a host nation,"" explains Gen Hartman. ""You immediately have some concern that we're going to go do something nefarious or it's some super-secret kind of backdoor operation.""
Put simply, the Americans need to convince their hosts they are there to help them - and not to spy on them.
""I'm not interested in your emails,"" is how Mark, who led two teams in the Indo-Pacific region, describes his opening gambit. If a demonstration goes well they can get down to work.
Local partners sometimes sit with US teams around in conference rooms observing closely to make sure nothing untoward is going on. ""We have to make sure we convey that trust,"" says Eric, a 20-year veteran of cyber operations. ""Having people sit side-saddle with us is a big factor in developing that.""  
And although suspicion can never be totally dispelled, a common adversary binds them together.
""The one thing that these partners want is the Russians out of their networks,"" Gen Hartman recalls one of his team telling him. 
US Cyber Command offers an insight into what the Russians, or others, are up to, particularly since it works closely with the National Security Agency, America's largest intelligence agency which monitors communications and cyberspace.
In one case, proof of infiltration came in real-time. One US operator, Chris, who has led multiple European missions, recalls observing someone move suspiciously around the computer network of a partner country. 
What was bizarre was that it appeared to be one of the local network administrators the team was working with. That person was standing right behind Chris. Could it be some kind of insider threat?
""Is that you?"" Chris asked. 
""That is my computer, but I swear that's not me,"" the administrator responded, transfixed as if watching a movie. Someone had stolen his online identity. 
""Finding someone on your network is not a good moment especially when they are using your credentials,"" Chris recalls. That moment conveyed the reality of the threat and in turn helped secure more access. 
US teams say they share what they find to allow the local partner to eject Russians (or other state hackers) rather than do it themselves. They also use commercial tools so that local partners can continue after the mission is over. 
A good relationship can pay dividends. At the end of one mission, US operators say that local partners handed them a parting gift - a computer disc containing malicious software, or malware, from another network the team had not been inside.
Each mission is different and there are some where an adversary has been found on the very first day of looking, explains Shannon who has led two missions in Europe. But it often takes a week or two to unearth more advanced hackers who have burrowed deeper.
A cat-and-mouse game is often played with hackers from Russian intelligence agencies who are particularly adept at changing tactics.
In 2021, it emerged the Russians had used software from a company called SolarWinds to infiltrate the networks of the customers who bought it, including governments.
US operators began looking for traces of their presence. A tech sergeant in Cyber Command who liked puzzles spotted the way the Russians were hiding their code in one European country, General Hartman says. Unscrambling it, he was able to establish the Russians were hiding on a network. Eight different samples of malicious software, all attributed to Russian intelligence, were then made public to allow industry to improve defences. 
Hunting is not an altruistic act by the US military. As well as providing hands-on experience for its teams, it can also help at home. In one mission, a young enlisted cyber operator found the same malware they had discovered in a European country was also present on a US government agency. The US has often struggled to identify and root out vulnerabilities domestically, whether in industry or government, because of overlapping responsibilities between different agencies even as it sends out its operators abroad.
Hunt Forward missions are classed as ""defensive"" but Gen Paul Nakasone, who leads both the military's Cyber Command and the National Security Agency confirmed offensive missions have also been undertaken against Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. But he and others declined to provide further detail.
January, the team in Ukraine were trying to avoid slipping on icy pavements when a series of major cyber-attacks hit. ""Be afraid and expect the worst,"" read a message posted by hackers on the Foreign Ministry website.
US team watched in real-time as a wave of so-called wiper software, which renders computers unusable, hit multiple government websites.  
""They were able to assist in analysing some of the ongoing attacks, and facilitate that information being shared back to partners in the United States,"" Gen Hartman says.
m was to destabilise the country ahead of the February invasion.
By the time Russian troops flooded over the border, the US team had been pulled out. Knowledge of the physical risk for their Ukrainian partners who remained weighed heavily on them.
Hours before the invasion began on 24 February, a cyber-attack crippled a US satellite communications provider that supported the Ukrainian military. Many predicted this would be the start of a wave of attacks to take down key areas like railways. But that did not happen.
""One of the reasons the Russians may not have been so successful is that the Ukrainians were better prepared,"" says Gen Hartman. 
""There's a lot of pride in the way they were able to defend. A lot of the world thought they would just be run over. And they weren't,"" says Al, a senior technical analyst who was part of the Ukrainian deployment team. ""They resisted.""
Ukraine has been subject to continued cyber-attacks which, if successful, could have affected infrastructure. But the country has continued to defend itself better than many expected. Ukrainian officials have said that this has been in part thanks to help from allies, including US Cyber Command and the private sector as well as their own growing experience. Now, the US and other allies are turning to the Ukrainians to learn from them. 
""We continue to share information with the Ukrainians, they continue to share information with us,"" explains Gen Hartman. ""That's really the whole idea of that enduring partnership."" 
With Ukrainian and Western intelligence officials expressing concerns that Moscow may respond to recent military setbacks by escalating its cyber-attacks, it is a partnership that may still face further tests."	/news/uk-63328398
sports	Azeem Rafiq: Hate crime inquiry after man defecates in cricketer's garden	"A hate crime investigation has been started by police after a man defecated in the garden of former Yorkshire cricketer Azeem Rafiq.
Earlier this month, the ex-bowler told MPs he had become a target of abuse since speaking out about racism.
During the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee hearing, the 31-year-old described being abused and spoke of a man ""defecating"" in his garden.
Police said they believed the incident was racially motivated.
South Yorkshire force said it was reported a man had defecated in the front garden of an address on Gawber Road in Barnsley just before 18:20 GMT on 5 October.
ued a CCTV image of a man they want to speak to in connection with their investigation and urged anyone who recognised him to contact police.
Last year, Rafiq was found to have been the victim of racial harassment and bullying while he was a player at Yorkshire County Cricket Club.
He told MPs that English cricket was ""institutionally"" racist, sparking the scandal that has dogged English cricket for much of the past two years.
His testimony led to changes in Yorkshire's leadership, Headingley being temporarily stripped of hosting international matches, and reprimands for several current and former players and coaches.
It also led to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) putting together a 12-point plan to tackle racism in the game.

technology	ChatGPT: New AI chatbot has everyone talking to it	"A new chatbot has passed one million users in less than a week, the project behind it says.
ChatGPT was publicly released on Wednesday by OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research firm whose founders included Elon Musk.
But the company warns it can produce problematic answers and exhibit biased behaviour.
Open AI says it's ""eager to collect user feedback to aid our ongoing work to improve this system"".
ChatGPT is the latest in a series of AIs which the firm refers to as GPTs, an acronym which stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.
m, an early version was fine-tuned through conversations with human trainers.
m also learned from access to Twitter data according to a tweet from Elon Musk who is no longer part of OpenAI's board. The Twitter boss wrote that he had paused access ""for now"".
results have impressed many who've tried out the chatbot. OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman revealed the level of interest in the artificial conversationalist in a tweet.
roject says the chat format allows the AI to answer ""follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises and reject inappropriate requests""
A journalist for technology news site Mashable who tried out ChatGPT reported it is hard to provoke the model into saying offensive things.
Mike Pearl wrote that in his own tests ""its taboo avoidance system is pretty comprehensive"".
However, OpenAI warns that ""ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers"".
raining the model to be more cautious, says the firm, causes it to decline to answer questions that it can answer correctly.
Briefly questioned by the BBC for this article, ChatGPT revealed itself to be a cautious interviewee capable of expressing itself clearly and accurately in English.  
Did it think AI would take the jobs of human writers? No - it argued that ""AI systems like myself can help writers by providing suggestions and ideas, but ultimately it is up to the human writer to create the final product"".
Asked what would be the social impact of AI systems such as itself, it said this was ""hard to predict"". 
Had it been trained on Twitter data? It said it did not know.
Only when the BBC asked a question about HAL, the malevolent fictional AI from the film 2001, did it seem troubled.
Although that was most likely just a random error - unsurprising perhaps, given the volume of interest.
Other firms which opened conversational AIs to general use, found they could be persuaded to say offensive or disparaging things.
Many are trained on vast databases of text scraped from the internet, and consequently they learn from the worst as well as the best of human expression.
Meta's BlenderBot3 was highly critical of Mark Zuckerberg in a conversation with a BBC journalist.
In 2016, Microsoft apologised after an experimental AI Twitter bot called ""Tay"" said offensive things on the platform.
And others have found that sometimes success in creating a convincing computer conversationalist brings unexpected problems. 
Google's Lamda was so plausible that a now-former employee concluded it was sentient, and deserving of the rights due to a thinking, feeling, being, including the right not to be used in experiments against its will.  
ChatGPT's ability to answer questions caused some users to wonder if it might replace Google.
Others asked if journalists' jobs were at risk. Emily Bell of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism worried that readers might be deluged with ""bilge"".
One question-and-answer site has already had to curb a flood of AI-generated answers.
Others invited ChatGPT to speculate on AI's impact on the media.
General purpose AI systems, like ChatGPT and others, raise a number of ethical and societal risks, according to Carly Kind of the Ada Lovelace Institute.
Among the potential problems of concern to Ms Kind are that AI might perpetuate disinformation, or ""disrupt existing institutions and services  - ChatGDT might be able to write a passable job application, school essay or grant application, for example"". 
re are also, she said, questions around copyright infringement ""and there are also privacy concerns, given that these systems often incorporate data that is unethically collected from internet users"".
However, she said they may also deliver ""interesting and as-yet-unknown societal benefits"".
ChatGPT learns from human interactions, and OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman tweeted that those working in the field also have much to learn.
AI has a ""long way to go, and big ideas yet to discover. We will stumble along the way, and learn a lot from contact with reality. 
""It will sometimes be messy. We will sometimes make really bad decisions, we will sometimes have moments of transcendent progress and value,"" he wrote."	/news/technology-63861322
sports	Pele and 1970: How the greatest player of all time cemented his legend	"As Brazil's team bus weaves its way through the streets of Mexico City en route to the Azteca Stadium for the final of the 1970 World Cup, the players on board joyously hammer out a samba beat. Every available surface, be it rain-flecked window, roof or unused seat, is an instrument.
In the third of our World Cup icons series, BBC Sport tells the story of Pele and his role in helping Brazil bring us the beautiful game in 1970.
Leading the way with his drum is singing winger Jairzinho, 'The Hurricane', scorer of a goal in every one of his team's five games so far in the tournament, all of them victories.
Joining in is Roberto Rivellino, the graceful attacking midfielder and scorer of the first of the 15 goals that has taken them to the final; Carlos Alberto Torres, the strong-willed, brilliant captain who helped keep holders England at bay in the group stages; Gerson, Tostao, Clodoaldo and the rest, superstars of this unparalleled side, on their way to immortality.
ud for everyone to hear a single rattle fall to the floor, the players too engaged in their singing and thoughts of glory to pay much notice to the man who intentionally dropped it. 
Pele - the greatest player in the world, the talisman of the team - is crouched, hiding, tears streaming down his face.
Edson Arantes do Nascimento, known to the world as Pele, knew only success during the first eight years of his international career.
He was just 16 years old when he made a scoring debut for Brazil in 1957, against Argentina no less. In less than a year, he netted twice in the final against hosts Sweden as his country won their first ever World Cup.
Four years later, in Chile, injury would curtail his game time but not his legend as Brazil made it back-to-back triumphs in the world's biggest tournament.
He was then undoubtedly the planet's finest footballer - fast, strong, skilful, intelligent, improvisational and unselfish. He was a global star, who crowds would flock to see. He adored the game and it adored him back.
Such status comes at a cost, though. His was to become a marked man and over the summer of 1966 he would find that others in the sport were unwilling to tolerate his genius. It was at Goodison Park, the home of Everton Football Club, that he would have much of his love for the game kicked out of him. Literally.
Portugal defender Joao Morais would be the last in a line of hatchet men tasked with nullifying Pele by any means at that World Cup, his most brutal act a trip followed by a two-footed lunge that left the Brazilian forward powerless to influence what would be a 3-1 loss.
result confirmed Brazil's exit at the group stage and with it ended their proud, eight-year ownership of the Jules Rimet trophy in dire and hubristic fashion.
""A total, shameful failure"" was how Pele later described it in his autobiography, adding: ""Everyone thought we'd win with ease. But our preparations were not planned with the same humility as in 1958 or 1962. We were already starting to lose the title before we even set foot in England.""
Beaten, bruised and thoroughly disillusioned, he turned his back on the international game.
It was a hammer blow to Brazil. Pele's power went beyond what he was capable of on a football field. He was a unifying force for a vast and multi-cultural country with large impoverished areas, from which he himself had emerged. He was a symbol of hope.
was a man once declared a ""non-exportable national treasure"" following an emergency session of Congress when clubs from Italy came hunting his signature in his late teens.
His importance as a figurehead had only increased during a time of instability and uncertainty, with the country under military rule following the coup d'etat of 1964.
Relinquishing the World Cup was a blow. Losing Pele was unthinkable.
me can be a great healer, as can perspective. Pele found comfort in both during the next few years and when attentions again began to turn to a World Cup he was a changed man to the one left reeling by his experience in England. 
Fatherhood had helped to ease his dissatisfaction with football, while a tour to Africa with Santos and witnessing the huge, adoring crowds that gathered to see him - a black man - and his side gave him a new outlook on his importance as a role model.
He was also brimming with renewed confidence after a number of strong club seasons, during which he had taken his career goal tally to 1,000 - a moment of epic proportions in Brazil, where news of the great man reaching the landmark shared front pages with the Apollo 12 moon landing.
Pele was also not immune to that most gnawing of fears for all elite sports stars of wanting ""not to end my career as a loser"".
Finally convinced to return to the national side by promises of greatly improved preparation by the Brazilian Commission of Sports and a clampdown on foul play through the introduction of yellow and red cards for the tournament in Mexico, Pele's decision was initially vindicated by a stellar qualification campaign.
He contributed six of the 23 goals scored as a settled, scintillating side won six out of six under coach Joao Saldanha.
However, calm confidence soon gave way to chaos, with the erratic Saldanha at the centre of it, seemingly determined to undo all the good work by clashing with the media, employing dubious match strategies - most damningly in a defeat by Argentina - and sacrilegiously questioning Pele's place in the side. 
His most ill-advised fight was the one he picked with General Emilio Garrastazu Medici, the president of Brazil's military regime, who did not take favourably to being told to stay out of national team affairs.
Saldanha was sacked soon after, but refused to go quietly, aiming much of his vitriol in the direction of his former number 10, firstly stating he was short-sighted (which was technically true but clearly not detrimental to his game), before escalating his attack with unfounded claims that he was unfit and suffering from a ""severe illness"", prompting a worried Pele to obtain reassurances from team doctors.
While Pele had no serious concerns on the pitch, off it was a different matter.
He was popular in Mexico. One previous visit to Guadalajara with Brazil had prompted nearly the whole town to close, with posters placed on street corners stating: ""No work today, we're off to see Pele!"" But the country was politically volatile in the summer of 1970. The arrest of a group of Cuban-trained guerrillas by police led to a tip-off of a potential plot to kidnap Brazil's star before the World Cup.
As a result, in the weeks leading up to the tournament, Brazil trained in a fortified camp, patrolled day and night by police and armed guards, with Pele himself hidden behind a circle of protection wherever he went.
rimental impact was in part testament to the planning, which stretched back to friendlies played in Mexico as far back as 1968 and three and half months of dedicated preparation ahead of the tournament, including 21 days spent training at altitude. 
When it came, their first game against Czechoslovakia at the Estadio Jalisco was a release, not just for the determined Pele but a focused, honed squad and 96 million expectant people back home.
Mexico 1970 was an explosion of colour, and no side possessed a richer palette than Brazil.
In a tournament televised live and in full technicolour for the first time to a global audience who only a year earlier had witnessed Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon, the balletic movement and sublime skill of those clad in vibrant canary yellow and cobalt blue was an apt giant leap into a bold and brilliant new footballing world.
Empowered to use their independence and intelligence as well as their ability by Saldanha's successor Mario Zagallo, a former team-mate of Pele's in '58 and '62, theirs was a football beholden to attack.
Blessed with a plethora of number 10s, Zagallo found a way to accommodate them all - Jairzinho and Rivellino operating in versatile wide roles, Tostao as a false nine and Gerson playing deeper in midfield.
At the centre of it all was Pele, a magnet for the ball on the field and for eyeballs off it, his every touch meaningful, his every forward run simmering with intent and possibility.
His game had always centred around control, pace, power and vision, but here they combined in perfect synchronisation with his evolution as a player.
In '58 he was raw, in '62 he was injured, in '66 he was hampered but in 1970 he was experienced, fit, free and focused. This was uncut, flawless Pele and he dazzled like never before.
g game was a ferocious rebuttal to all those who had written him off, including Czech coach Jozef Marko who's side took an early lead but was then left to rue describing the forward as a ""spent force"".
An impudent nutmeg of Ivan Hrdlicka was a taster, followed soon after by him winning the free-kick from which Rivellino hammered Brazil level. Better was to follow. On the hour mark, the number 10 rose in the box to perfectly cushion Gerson's pinpoint 50-yard pass in mid-air, steering it towards his landing before steadying himself to fire home. Jairzinho's late double completed a 4-1 rout.
What many remember most from that game, though, was not the goal Pele scored, but the one he did not - an outrageous lob from inside his own half that beat Czech goalkeeper Ivo Viktor but sailed inches wide.
Surging with a confidence that comes from total control over one's game, he would admit afterwards that it was pre-planned - devised after spotting that European goalkeepers had a tendency to wander from their line. His only regret was that he had not saved it for a more illustrious opponent, one of which was just around the corner.
England were the benchmark at Mexico 1970, the current holders that many felt had only grown stronger in the four years since their maiden World Cup triumph. For Brazil this was a 'final before the final'. For Pele, it was also an emotional hurdle to clear.
It had been England celebrating in the summer of 1966 as Pele sat at home, nursing his bruised body and pride. Symbolically, this was the game in which he could finally lay all the frustration of four years ago to rest.
He did not disappoint in an extremely high-quality but also fiercely-contested encounter often boiled down simplistically to Brazil's attacking flair versus England's defensive ferocity. The English could also play, Brazil and their talisman equally able to mix it.
Alan Mullery, the man tasked with marking Pele, has since admitted to hitting the forward hard in the game to try and throw him off, but that he was physically and mentally equal to it.
In his autobiography Nobby Stiles, who watched on from the bench that day, wrote: ""It was nothing less than daunting to see the ease with which Pele held off his marker. Repeatedly Mullers tried to hustle him off the ball. Repeatedly, he failed.""
Only twice, though, did Pele fully escape from the efficient Mullery's dogged attention - the first resulted in arguably the finest save of all time, the second settled the game.
Gordon Banks' save is part of English football folklore - a physics-defying leap to tip the ball over his bar from pretty much the whitewash of the goal-line. At the other end of the field, Brazil keeper Felix could only clap in appreciation. Pele himself described it as ""the save of that tournament and of most other tournaments you could care to mention"". That the ball was propelled towards goal by the forehead of the world's greatest player cements its legend.
Jairzinho scored Brazil's winner but it was made by the skill of Tostao, who beat three England defenders before crossing, and the vision of Pele, who in one fluid movement in the tightest space shaped to shoot before flicking the ball to his right, perfectly into the path of the goalscorer.
""When Brazil scored their winning goal, we saw another vital aspect of Pele's game - humility,"" continued Styles. ""It was best expressed in his understanding of the needs of the team. Pele cut out two England defenders with the simple pass that played in Jairzinho. That was pure Pele.
""His performances in Mexico surely represented his prime - you saw a talent that he had honed down to all the essentials of winning football. If a simple pass would work best for the team, he would play it. It was only if he was under pressure and lacking other options that he would launch some outrageous initiative. He was both the engine and the heart of Brazil, as well as being the ultimate example of that nation's superb feeling for the game.""
England's captain Bobby Moore, the man that had lifted the Jules Rimet trophy four years earlier, paid Pele the ultimate compliment at full-time, swapping shirts with him, prompting their now iconic topless embrace.
Brazil had their symbolic scalp but refused to rest on their laurels or compromise their principles.
A 3-2 win over Romania - with Pele scoring twice via a fierce free-kick and neat, low finish - saw them top the group and set up a knock-out tie with Peru.
It would be a quarter-final for the ages, a meeting of like-minded South American rivals, fighting fire with fire. The Peruvians had the advantage of an insider at the helm in Didi, a former team-mate of Pele's in the '58 and '62 World Cups. Ultimately, the Brazilians had the greater firepower, winning 4-2 in a display that further underlined their togetherness.
was a unified Brazil, a family. Off the pitch a nightly ritual had begun, led by the devoutly Catholic Pele. The players would gather together to pray - for the sick, the poor, victims of the ongoing war in Vietnam, but never for victory. That they had to earn. To do so, they would next have to slay a demon from the past.
Pele was nine years old when Brazil lost to Uruguay - one of their great rivals - in the final of the 1950 World Cup on home soil.
What had begun as a day of hope and joy - the country alive with the sound of firecrackers and radios turned up to full volume - ended in despair and silence.
Coming in from his own game in the street, played with a ball made from a paper-filled sock tied up with string, Pele found his father in tears.
Dondinho, a talented semi-pro footballer himself, had nurtured his son's love for the game, imparting technique and wisdom. Now the son saw an opportunity to offer something in return.
In his father's room, he looked to a picture of Jesus on the wall. ""If I'd been there I wouldn't have let Brazil lose,"" he declared. ""If I'd been there Brazil would have won."" Twenty years later, he made good on the promise.
It didn't start well. Uruguay led the semi-final in Guadalajara after 20 minutes. Midway through the first-half, though, Brazil began to play and, with a minute to go until the break, Clodoaldo equalised with his first international goal.
Pele had been relatively quiet but his influence on the game grew and grew. A brilliant, gliding run was ended by a crude tackle, a first-time shot denied by a scrambling Uruguayan keeper, another soon after flew just wide.
An injury-hit and tiring Uruguay, who had been taken to extra time by the USSR in the last eight, were broken when Jairzinho gave Brazil the lead with 15 minutes to go. The relentless Pele set up Rivellino for a third in the closing stages. There was still time for one final flourish from the number 10.
In stoppage time, Tostao's through ball for Pele drew out Uruguay keeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz, but instead of taking it around him the forward dummied, allowing the ball to run past both him and his opponent. Having been forced wide and to shoot first time because of a backtracking defender, Pele's shot rolled agonisingly wide.
result fulfilled Pele's pledge to his father and left Brazil one game from glory. 
With tears on his face and the repetitive beat of his team-mates' batucada [percussive samba] filling his ears, Pele calms himself. This is not a time for doubt. He is the most established of his country's players, a two-time world champion, a leader. Having undertaken such a journey to get here, he must not stumble now.
He picks up his rattle, rises once more to his feet and rejoins the mobile orchestra winding its way through the streets of Mexico City.
A few hours later, a photographer captures an image of the Brazil and Italy teams lined up in the Azteca Stadium before kick-off, 100,000 fans screaming at them from all sides of the sweltering cauldron in Mexico's capital.
In it, the face of almost every player is forward and focused, every sinew seemingly stretched to control the simmering pan of nerves within. The exception is Pele, who stares to his left, straight down the camera's lens with a look of unerring calm and confidence.
For the opening stages, Italy keep the door bolted, their solid catenaccio style doing its job. But in the 18th minute a chance arrives. Rivellino's cross is hooked and hopeful, but it's trajectory to the back post perfect. Pele has the run on Tarcisio Burgnich, his spring ensuring he rises highest to power home a precise header.
Pele leaps again, this time into the arms of Jairzinho, his fist pumping the air in delight.
Before half-time, a set-back. Brazil's defence errs, Roberto Boninsegna emerging from amid the chaos to roll the ball into an unguarded net.
re is no panic at the break. Brazil are the fresher side after Italy's marathon semi-final against West Germany four days earlier. They have the talent and tactical plan to take advantage.
Pele is inches away from a Carlos Alberto cross, Rivellino strikes the crossbar from a free-kick. There are 66 minutes on the clock when Gerson collects the ball on the edge of the box and fires a strike beyond the left hand of Enrico Albertosi and into the net.
Soon after, Gerson's driven pass forward is met by the head of Pele - rising once more behind the bamboozled Burgnich, springs in his heels - to head down for Jairzinho to complete a full sweep of scoring in every game of the tournament. Italy's challenge undone in six second-half minutes.
xt 15 minutes go by in a giddy blur, the carousel of yellow shirts dancing their way around a dejected foe.
Italians are praying for the final whistle when Tostao tracks back to win the ball and lay off to Wilson Piazza, who then helps work it into midfield for Clodoaldo. The midfielder slaloms around four Italian challenges to find Rivellino, who's forward pass releases Jairzinho down the left. He cuts inside to find Pele, who lays the ball off with perfect weight for Carlos Alberto to lash the ball first time into the far corner of the net.
It is a work of art. Perfection. A goal showcasing all that this Brazil stands for - teamwork, skill, improvisation, precision and planning. Zagallo had identified the Italian left as an area to exploit, but even he could not have imagined they would do so with such beautiful ruthlessness.
Once again at a crucial point there was Pele, his assist so simple yet exact in its execution, his selflessness never better exemplified.
Photographers encroach on the pitch in search of a perfect shot. At full-time, delirious fans flood on to embrace the Brazilian players, tearing shirts and shorts from them. Pele is one of many chaired around the ground shirtless, having removed his top himself to avoid having it clawed from his back and his head taken with it.
Back in the changing room, he once again seeks solitude from the carnival taking place around him, moving into the shower to pray. He had ended his international career in glory and for that he wished to give thanks. The peace did not last long. A journalist bundles his way in and kneels in front of him to beg forgiveness for the doubts about the forward he had put to print prior to the tournament.
Pele ushers him to his feet. ""Only God can forgive,"" he tells him. ""And I am not God.""
Some time later, when the dust had settled on Mexico 1970 and Pele's exploits had already begun to seep into legend, Burgnich - the man tasked with attempting to man mark him in the final - was asked about the experience. 
""I told myself before the game, 'He's made of flesh and blood, just like me.'"" he reflected. ""I was wrong.""

A total of 98 workers were made redundant after Garth Bakery, in Abercynon, Rhondda Cynon Taf, stopped trading on 9 November.
Administrators SFP Group are investigating the failure of the firm, which made 300,000 rolls a week.
SFP is now looking for buyers for assets, including vehicles and machinery.
It said plans were being made for perishable stock to be given to local charitable organisations to ensure the food does not go to waste.
mpany supplies schools in south Wales, Tesco, Asda and Co-op.
Joint administrator David Kemp said: ""It is extremely saddening to see such a long-established and important business for the local community close.
""While our review is still in its infancy, we understand that a variety of pressures, including general price rises, have contributed to the closure.""
Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan said the authority was not told the 39-year-old business was in trouble and did not know whether it had sought help from the Welsh government.
Council support staff, he said, were working to clarify the position with the bakery.
Mr Morgan said: ""Through our Communities for Work programme and other schemes we will be looking to support all of those affected.
""Since the news broke, it is encouraging to see the community rallying as I have been contacted by a number of other local valleys firms. 
""They have stated that they would be keen to try and offer some vacancies to the staff at Garth Bakery, and I would urge any local companies who have vacancies to come forward and inform the council.""

politics	Nimco Ali: Adviser to step down to avoid serving under Braverman	"government's independent adviser on violence against women has said she does not want to serve under Suella Braverman and will not continue.
On live radio, Nimco Ali said she was on a ""completely different planet"" to the home secretary when it came to women's rights and ethnic minorities.
Ms Ali was appointed when her friend Boris Johnson was prime minister.
A source close to the home secretary said Ms Ali's contract was coming to an end before Christmas.
: ""The home secretary is determined to make our streets and homes safer for women and girls.
""She will continue to focus on this policy and the rights of women and girls to live safely in our country.""
Home Office said they had not received any formal resignation and were therefore not commenting.
Ms Ali was being interviewed on Times Radio  when she said she would not ""feel comfortable in serving under Suella"".
""Suella and I are on completely different planets when it comes to the rights of women and girls and also the way that we talk about ethnic minorities,"" she said.
Ms Ali said Ms Braverman had different approaches to ""people like me who are from a refugee background"".
She also questioned if the home secretary shared her ""feminist ideals"". 
When pressed on whether she would remain as an adviser, she said ""ultimately no, I'm not going to continue"".
move comes hours after the home secretary agreed to back a bill criminalising street harassment. 
Ms Ali had a major role in preparing the ground work for the bill and led a consultation into making street harassment a specific crime while serving under former home secretary Priti Patel.
Ms Ali was appointed to her role by Ms Patel in October 2020.
BBC understands there has been no decision about appointing someone else to the role of Independent Adviser on Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls.
Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called Ms Ali's decision ""damning for Suella Braverman"". 
Ms Cooper said: ""Those around her clearly don't think she's capable of doing the job. 
""It shows how weak Rishi Sunak was to appoint her. More chaos at the heart of this Tory government."" 
An ally of Ms Braverman indicated she had not met Ms Ali in her three months as home secretary."	/news/uk-politics-63924098

entertainment	Edinburgh Fringe: The viral comedy stars leaping from TikTok to the stage	"A number of new comedians amassed huge followings on TikTok during the pandemic. Now some are trying to convert viral fame into on-stage success by performing live at the Edinburgh Fringe.
kTok has emerged as a major force in comedy, by letting anyone share short, funny videos. The company is even sponsoring Edinburgh's annual comedy festival and hosting a virtual stage this year.
While social media isn't likely to replace stand-up, it has allowed a new generation of budding comedy stars to bypass the traditional routes to make their names.
But can the online sensations cut it in front of a live audience? Here, four of the biggest TikTok comedy acts who are performing at Edinburgh this month talk about becoming viral stars, taking to the stage - and whether the two can exist together.
In the olden days (ie a few years ago), a comedian at Edinburgh would hope to be spotted by an agent or TV producer who might one day be able to help them build a global fanbase. In the age of TikTok, performers like Christian Brighty can do it themselves in a few months.
""I'm going to tour America next year - which is an obscene, ridiculous idea,"" says Brighty, 28, from Cambridgeshire. ""I'm an alternative comic who, in 2019, was doing shows in dingy pub basements where I think Covid began. And I now have enough people to go and take my show to America. That's insane.""
Just under half of his 430,000 TikTok followers are in the US, and it's easy to imagine his riotous and knowing parodies of lusty period dramas going down well in the post-Bridgerton era. He joined the platform while furloughed during lockdown, posting a video a day for a month.
""It was a safe enclosed space to be creative, to experiment, to fail,"" he says. ""There are no repercussions for posting a bad video because no-one will see it. But if you post a good one, then millions of people might see it. I learned so much in that time.""
His first video to break the million mark was inspired by watching Poldark with his girlfriend's family. He has gone on to establish regular, silly characters - a romantic poet, a highwayman with a hobbyhorse, and a running story that sends up the allure of the archetypal aloof hero.
Forcing himself to make lots of TikToks honed his joke writing and quality control, he says. ""And it's made me become a better live performer, without a doubt.""
His Edinburgh show Playboy, co-written with Amy Greaves, centres on another alter-ego, Lord Christian Brighty, a cross between Mr Darcy from Pride and Prejudice and Blackadder's Lord Flashheart.
""You can't just take what you do on TikTok and put it in front of an audience live. It won't work,"" he says. 
""I describe them as siblings because they require different sensibilities. There's stuff in the [live] show that's far too slow for TikTok, because on TikTok you need a joke immediately, it needs a strong visual, and the idea needs to be at the header. Whereas you can't really do that on stage.""
ge show is more fully-formed and is ""the more authentic version of me"", he says. It was praised by The Telegraph, which said: ""An amusing 10-second video doesn't always translate to a good hour in the theatre, but in this case it indisputably has.""
Abi Clarke was ""very new"" to stand-up after spending a year doing low-key shows on the circuit before the pandemic hit. By the time the lockdowns finally ended, she emerged with hundreds of thousands of online fans. She now has 840,000 followers on TikTok and 360,000 on Instagram.
""Before, I was able to be anonymous and if a gig went bad, I'd just disappear and think, no-one's going to remember anyway,"" she says. ""Whereas now, there's more pressure there. Quite often people in the audience do know who you are or have come specifically for you.""
Some have even turned up wearing her merch. But on stage, Clarke is still taking things slowly.
She's not doing the standard solo hour-long show at Edinburgh, instead being one of four new comics on the bill at the Pleasance venue's prestigious Comedy Reserve night. ""I'm still in training,"" she says.
""If you see someone with a large social media following, a lot of people think you're the same as the comedians they see on telly. They're like, 'Well, you're a famous comedian'. But no, any comedian you see on TV has probably been going at least six years. And I've been going since 2019, with a two-year pandemic in the middle with no live performing.""
She found success online with shrewdly-observed, shareable sketches like If Cats Were Human and If Dogs Were Human, and skits about office gossips Jill and Tracey, and life inside Asos HQ. With their quick edits, multiple characters and maximum running times of a minute, they are very different from her stand-up routine.
""They really don't bleed into each other a lot to be honest. I'd say only twice I've written [live] material and written a sketch about the same thing.""
Her live routine is also ""a lot ruder"", she says. ""You get to be a bit naughtier on stage, whereas I think on the internet things can get taken out of context or people who speak different languages don't understand you're joking. So I think you've got to be very wholesome online. You've got to be your chirpy self.
""But on stage I get to show all sides of me, which is really fun because you work to get them [the audience] to like you at the start and then you can see how far you can go without losing them.""
When Irish comedian Lee Brophy started posting parodies as a lip-syncing, LGBT-accepting Catholic priest who ""puts the bi in Bible"", he attracted more than 700,000 followers on TikTok - and reactions ranging from death threats to cries for help from queer teens in strict religious families.
Brophy's Edinburgh stand-up show, titled False Prophet, is about the double-edged impact of becoming known as the TikTok priest - and he will effectively kill off the character at the end of the festival.
""It's been a weird journey,"" says Brophy, who was also on the stand-up circuit before the pandemic. ""I wasn't prepared for any of this. I was just making silly jokes on the internet and trying to get a little bit of feedback from people. And I got a lot of feedback from people.""
His broad-minded, fun-loving priest was originally in a TV pilot that Brophy wrote at the start of lockdown. The comedian decided to test the script by posting clips on TikTok.
""The priest was a very minor character to begin with,"" he explains. ""Then I put him up online and he had this progressive point of view that people resonated with, and I was like, oh, there's an appetite for this.
""So I thought, I'll just do that. It became a scenario of me waking up every single morning, putting on what was to me a costume, and sitting in front of my phone by nine o'clock lip-synching to Taylor Swift.""
Some didn't get the joke, though. ""There are the people who believe I'm a priest and love it. And then there are the people who absolutely detest it, who are like, 'You are leading people to hell'.""
His task now, he says, is to ""not necessarily erase that part because I'm grateful for all the things that have come out of it - but to [show] I am not that person, give myself the freedom to be a performer again, and to be recognised as a performer and comedian and an artist"".
In a five-star review, Edinburgh Guide said it was ""so clear that this is just the stepping stone into something so much greater"".
So, after his Edinburgh run, he will post a video putting Father Lee out to pasture. ""I've been playing along with this because it's been funny to me, but I kind of want my life back now,"" he says.
Before the pandemic, sisters Chloe and Tabby Tingey had given up on being performers. Chloe, who trained at Berklee College of Music in Boston, was working in digital marketing. Tabby, who went to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, had retrained to teach yoga.
Covid hit, the yoga studio never opened, and the pair moved in together. They dipped their toes into TikTok with weightlifting challenges, strangely. Then, having both been recently dumped, they decided to post a comic song about relationships.
""We thought no-one would see it because nobody followed us at that point,"" says Tabby, 28. They were wrong, and tens of thousands did see it.
Chloe, 30, continues: ""We thought, oh, this is the most views we've ever had in our whole lives, so maybe we should just ride this wave. But it was a huge shock and surprise.""
r videos became more elaborate, and soon attracted millions of views. ""To this day, we're still shocked every day when we wake up that we're musical comedians,"" Chloe adds. ""This is very unexpected.""
As well as parodies about dating and men, they do hugely popular spoofs of a party-loving Boris Johnson. They usually rewrite the lyrics of pop hits, and now have 400,000 followers.
r live show Bittersweet, on the other hand, is all made up of their own frank and funny songs, which mostly take aim at manipulative, inadequate and infuriating men - ""every second-rate Romeo we've ever known"", as one tune puts it.
A couple of songs have appeared both online and on stage, but mostly there's not much crossover. Writing an hour-long stage show was ""very different than having these isolated little ideas"", Tabby says. 
Chloe explains: ""It's small little bits on TikTok, and for the live show we've had to really think about the arc of it, and how it all fits together.""
It is ""difficult to gauge"" how many people in the Edinburgh audience are there because of TikTok, Tabby says.
Her sister adds: ""Somebody came to our show who had come all the way from Illinois to see us because she's a TikTok fan of ours. That made us really feel an immense gratitude.""

health	John Radcliffe Hospital: Patients using A&E hits record high	"umber of people being treated or waiting for treatment at a major hospital's A&E department has hit a record high. 
Lily O'Connor, Oxfordshire's urgent care director, said 157 patients were in the John Radcliffe Hospital's emergency department in Oxford on Monday evening. 
She said despite the ""unprecedented"" demand staff had coped well.
But they were working under ""persistent pressure"", she added. 
While she said demand ""fluctuates"" at the county's other hospital, the Horton General in Banbury, staff at the A&E there have regularly been placed ""under significant pressure"" over recent months. 
John Radcliffe has been ""under significant pressure since August"" across all ages, and demand for children's services has got ""particularly bad"" over recent weeks.   
""When we hit 100 [patients] it's pretty tough on everybody because we have got a large volume of people to see at a single point in time and [are] trying to ensure that everyone who needs immediate care gets it. 
""To get 157 in the early evening [on Monday] was unprecedented at the John Radcliffe,"" Ms O'Connor told BBC Radio Oxford.
Care Quality Commission said last month that the health and care system across England is gridlocked because patients cannot access the support they need. 
Its annual report said the problem was resulting in long waits for ambulances and in A&E departments. 
Pete Macgrane, Oxford Health's clinical director for community services, said that trust is also seeing increased demand. 
""Everything that we are doing is trying to make sure that we can support patients where at all possible and where it's clinically the right thing to do to remain within their own homes,"" he said.

politics	SNP preparing for general election, says Ian Blackford	"SNP is preparing for a general election as time ""needs to be up"" for the Tory government, the party's Westminster leader has said.
Ian Blackford said people in Scotland would be appalled at the idea of Boris Johnson returning as prime minister.
Speculation has grown over whether the former PM would join the race, although Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy declined to comment on the matter.
Meanwhile, Scottish Labour said a general election was ""inevitable"".
Commons leader Penny Mordaunt is so far the only contender to have officially launched a leadership campaign following the resignation of Liz Truss.
Rishi Sunak has become the first potential Tory candidate to secure backing from the 100 MPs needed to enter the race, while Boris Johnson has flown back to the UK following his Caribbean holiday.
Supporters have publicly rallied behind the ex-prime minister.
However, Ian Blackford said it would be ""beyond the pale"" for him to return given the Partygate scandal, during which Mr Johnson become the first prime minister to receive a criminal penalty while in office.
Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, the Mr Blackford said: ""It is almost beyond belief that the Conservatives would even consider this.
""You really have to question what the Conservatives are thinking if they think it is reasonable and rational to bring this man back into some kind of leadership contest. We don't want Boris Johnson anywhere near power.""
Confirming that the SNP are preparing for a general election, he added: ""It shouldn't just be down to Tory MPs and Tory members to pick the next prime minister.""
ry leadership hopefuls have until 14:00 BST on Monday to find 100 MP backers. If any candidate reaches 158 nominations out of the 357 Tory MPs the race will be reduced to two candidates, as there will not be enough MPs left to support a third candidate.
It will then go to an online ballot of the Conservative party membership, with the result to be announced on Friday.
But if the party's MPs get behind just one candidate, there could be a new prime minister by Monday afternoon.
Scottish Conservative Party chairman Craig Hoy refused to comment on the prospect that Mr Johnson could run in the contest.
Mr Hoy told Good Morning Scotland: ""In relation to myself as party chairman, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculation about candidates.""
However, he said a general election would be a ""huge distraction"" at a time when stability was needed.
""What we need now is stability for the good of the country, so that the UK government can help people through the difficult times ahead and start to rebuild our public services,"" he said.
With a new prime minister due to be installed by Friday, Mr Hoy said he hoped ""the party unites behind that candidate and we can move forward"".
But Scottish Labour's Daniel Johnson said a general election ""may be necessitated by events"" as he too decried the possible return of Mr Johnson.
He said: ""With Boris Johnson, I think we're headed for a full-blown crisis.
""It's not just the Labour Party saying that is unacceptable, plenty of their MPs are saying it would be unacceptable and they would quit.""
Speaking about the situation the UK is now in, the Labour MSP added: ""The country's paralysed.
""I think we may very well end up in the situation where a general election is inevitable, in fact it is required to cut through the complete chaos that is at the heart of the UK government because of the Conservative Party."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63357651
politics	Scotland loses UK climate change lead, advisers warn	"Scotland has lost its lead over the rest of the UK on tackling climate change, advisers have warned.
A report from the Climate Change Committee (CCC) said progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions has ""largely stalled"" in recent years.
Its independent assessment said Scotland's targets - some of the toughest in the world - were ""increasingly at risk"".
Scottish government insisted progress was being made in many areas.
Scottish government has set a legally-binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2045, five years ahead of the date set for the UK as a whole.
As a staging post, it legislated in 2019 to cut emissions by a massive 75% from 1990 baseline levels by the end of this decade.
way ahead of the UK government's aim to reduce emissions by 68% in the same time frame.
CCC report points out that since its Climate Change Act became law in 2009, the Scottish government has failed to achieved seven of the 11 legal targets.
Although it met the latest one, for 2020, it said that was because the Covid pandemic saw a temporary drop in transport emissions and that the figures will rebound in future years.
figure for 2020 was a 58.7% reduction from the 1990 baseline but the previous year it was just 51.5% - well short of the 55% target.
CCC report recommends lowering the annual targets so that the 2025 aim would be to reduce emissions by 61.7% rather than 65.5%.
report describes the target to cut emissions by 75% by 2030 as ""extremely challenging"" and suggests a 65% to 67% cut is more feasible.
It said the Scottish government lacked a clear delivery plan and had not offered a coherent explanation for how its policies would achieve the targets.
While the committee praised the ambition and focus on a transition which is fair and equitable, it said that should only be applauded if the targets are achieved.
CCC chief executive Chris Stark told BBC Scotland he did not think the Scottish government was doing nearly enough to get on track with its legal targets.
He said: ""We have seen failures across the board and it's a shame to say that.
""This year we are able to say Scotland has lost its lead in decarbonising.
""Scotland is at the same rate now as the rest of the UK and that did not used to be the case.""
Mr Stark said Scotland's early success was in cutting emissions from electricity generation such as closing coal-fired power stations. 
But he said the Scottish government had the powers to take action on decarbonising buildings, transport and farming and had not used them.
Net Zero minister Michael Matheson said the Climate Change Committee's advice was a reminder of the scale of the challenge.
He said: ""Progress has been made - Scotland is already more than half way to net zero - but we are now entering the most challenging part of the journey to date, with a need to halve our emissions again within the next eight years.""
Mr Matheson said that in many areas progress on reducing emissions in Scotland was dependent on decisions taken by the UK government. 
In Paris, in 2015, world leaders committed to limiting global warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.
Harmful greenhouse gas emissions - which cause the earth to warm - have more than halved in Scotland in the past 30 years.
But with the planet already 1.1C warmer than pre-industrial times, rapid progress is needed in the next 10 years if those temperature targets are to be met.
ransport is Scotland's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases but the committee said, despite having higher ambitions to decarbonise the sector, plans are falling behind other parts of the UK, with sales of electric cars now lower than those in England.
It said the Scottish government has been unwilling to consider measures to recover the shortfall such as by restricting growth in aviation.
mmittee said policies to decarbonise buildings were ""wholly inadequate"" and would not deliver the scale of low carbon heating required.
On agriculture and land use it said it was unclear how the emissions targets could be delivered without new policies and said restoration rates for peatland - a key store of carbon - were less than half the Scottish government's targets which is itself less than half of the CCC's recommendations.
Mike Robinson, from Stop Climate Chaos Scotland (SCCS), said the report was a ""wake up call"" for the Scottish government.
He said: ""Scotland needs bold, decisive and immediate action to reduce emissions. Without this, the trend of missed targets, and failure to tackle the climate crisis will only continue.""
Fabrice Leveque, from environmental campaign group WWF Scotland, said the report did not pull its punches.
He said that without ambitious efforts to transform how we heat our homes and new policies to reduce farming emissions Scotland's mantle of climate leader could be in jeopardy.
Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative Net Zero spokesman Liam Kerr MSP said the damning report showed the SNP-Green government were falling miles short in taking the action required to tackle the climate emergency.
Scottish Labour accused the Scottish government of ""empty rhetoric"" and warned that climate targets were ""in danger of becoming meaningless"". "	/news/uk-scotland-63872365
entertainment	Big Jeff creates first art since suffering severe burns	"A well-known gig-goer and artist has been commissioned to brighten up a hospital window during his recovery from severe burns.
Jeffrey 'Big Jeff' Johns has been at Southmead Hospital since August.
He was initially treated at a specialist burns unit in Swansea after a fire broke out at his home in June.
Mr Johns says the painting has doubled-up as physiotherapy, because he has been asked ""to practice reaching out and up"".
""It made me reach out in all directions whilst stimulating my brain,"" he told BBC West.
Mr Johns, known for attending hundreds of concerts a year in Bristol, is also a prolific painter, and has had pieces on show at several venues in the city, Including The Island.
He described his ""absolute joy"" at being able to paint once more.
""One of the things that's helped save me is my determination to hold a pen or brush in my left hand,"" he said.
""When I've been feeling depressed about my left hand/beating myself up about my body, having an expressive outlet really helps.""
Mr Johns is still recovering, following a fire at his flat in June.
He has had several operations and procedures to minimise the long-term effects of his burns.
""I'm still anxious about procedures to come,"" he said.
""I've got to make life-changing adaptations, some things I can't do for myself.
""I am hopeful that I can return home in the next month or so with support.""
In recent weeks, friends have taken Mr Johns to see sound checks at concerts, and it has lifted his spirit.
""I cried at my first soundcheck,"" he said.
""It was so invigorating and beautifully hypnotic.
""I was quite down and my friends came and took me out to the sound check. I felt all the stress and anxiety disappear in the noise.""

Illia Razumeiko co-composed and co-directed Chornobyldorf alongside Roman Grygoriv, who also conducts the work for their company Opera Aperta.
ra, which was created in 2020, will open the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival on 18 November.
It combines folk and classical singing, physical theatre, dance and film.
Mr Razumeiko, 33, told the PA news agency from Kyiv: ""It's a special story because for two years we tried to speak about some kind of abstract post-apocalypse, which might come in 300 or 700 years.
""What happened in February (when Russia invaded Ukraine) was like some sort of post-apocalypse that we can see on our mobile phones and around us with our own eyes.""
He said that since the war began, the opera had become a ""diplomatic mission"" to show Ukraine exists.
""Our language exists, our culture exists, and it is distinct from Russian culture,"" he said.
ra includes seven video episodes, taken from expeditions the pair took to Chernobyl's prohibited zone and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.
""We visited different places in Ukraine and now literally all these places are battlefields and places where Russian war crimes have been committed,"" Mr Razumeiko said.
Chernobyl also played a pivotal role in the opera because it had a ""very special history and is 1,000 years old and has some interesting Ukrainian and Jewish history"", he added.
He also spoke about life in Kyiv and people's optimism despite the ongoing war.
""News about Ukraine liberating Kherson also means a lot because it is a place with theatres and festivals and lots of culture,"" he said.
Graham McKenzie, artistic director of the festival, said: ""Chornobyldorf is an astonishing work in any time. 
""When Illia Razumeiko and I started to speak about bringing the opera to the festival, neither of us could have imagined its very real and heightened significance for this moment, as the threat of nuclear war and the unimaginable aftermath stares us in the face.""

politics	Apsana Begum: Labour MP calls for duty of care for abuse survivors	"Labour MP Apsana Begum has called for a duty of care to be placed on political parties and employers to ensure that survivors of domestic abuse are not exposed to further harassment.
Ms Begum told MPs she had been in a marriage to a man which had become ""volatile and abusive"".
Speaking in a Westminster Hall debate, she claimed he had continued to harass her after the relationship ended.
But her ex-husband accused her of using ""a false narrative of domestic abuse"".
Ms Begum claimed that the harassment ""intensified"" when she indicated she was going to stand to be Labour's candidate for Poplar and Limehouse.
She said he had threatened to expose her for ""who she really was"" and told her campaign team that he had been contacted by the media to sell stories on her.
By the end of their relationship, Ms Begum said, she was ""sleeping in the living room with a sofa pushed up against the door so that he couldn't get in"".
Ms Begum also claimed that a family member of her ex-husband was behind a complaint which resulted in a court case being brought against her for housing fraud, which went to trial in July 2021.
She was cleared of all charges.
Despite that, Ms Begum said she ""had to endure an eight-day trial which brutally forced me to talk about painful, private experiences"". 
She added: ""I fear that the ordeal of that trial will haunt me for the rest of my life.""
In June this year, she was signed off sick and began a phased return to work in September.
Ms Begum is currently facing a ""trigger process"" called by her local Labour party under which she risks facing deselection as Labour's candidate for the next election.
In her speech in Parliament, she claimed the process was being overseen by ""associates"" of her ex-husband, which she said was, to her mind, ""no coincidence"".
Ms Begum's ex-husband, Ehtasham Haque, said he remained ""steadfast in being given an opportunity to defend myself against these false allegations"".
""I am grateful to those who are treating me as innocent until proven guilty,"" he said.

Siobhan McGrath's early goal helped Galway side Sarsfields into an five-point lead but Loughgiel hit back.
Caitrin Dobbin netted and the teams were level at the break before Sarsfield burst clear with Rachel Murray firing in their second goal.
Loughgiel rallied again to equalise but Sarsfields finished strongly to win.
Earlier on Saturday at Croke Park, Down club Clonduff claimed the All-Ireland Intermediate title with a 0-12 to 1-6 victory over Kilkenny side James Stephens. 
Paula O'Hagan and Sara Louise Graffin combined for nine of Clonduff's scores as the Shamrocks secured the trophy for the second time, four years after the first.
It was a see-saw decider at headquarters with the outstanding Roisin McCormick firing over eight points for Loughgiel while the McGrath sisters - Siobhan and Niamh - were instrumental in Sarsfields securing their third All-Ireland crown.
Sarsfields made a blistering start with Siobhan McGrath shooting low into the net in the first minute and she added a point after team-mate Caoimhe Kelly slotted between the posts.
Mary McKillen put Loughgiel on the scoreboard and Niamh McGarth restored the five-point margin before the Ulster champions produced a run of 1-4 without reply, starting with points from Lucia McNaughton and McCormick.
Dobbin ran through before rifling into the bottom corner on 28 minutes and an Annie Lynn double left Loughgiel two points in front.
Kelly pulled one back and Klara Donohue registered the last point of the half to make it 1-6 to 1-6 at the break. 
McCormick edged Loughgiel back into the lead on the restart before Sarsfields seized control again with a 1-3 burst.
Siobhan McGarth and Shannon Corcoran flighted over before Murray blasted into the net, with the goal followed by a Niamh McGrath point.
Loughgiel showed spirit by wiping out another five-point deficit - four of the scores came from McCormick while Dobbin also pointed.
Siobhan McGrath and McCormick exchanged points before Sarsfields produced the decisive thrust with four straight points.
Player-of the-match Niamh McGrath bagged two with Siobhan McGrath and Sarah Spellman also slotting over.
McCormick made it eight points from eight frees to give Loughgiel a glimmer of hope but Sarsfields saw out the final minutes to earn a three-point success."	/sport/gaelic-games/64013031
sports	Commonwealth Games: NI's Kate O'Connor second in heptathlon after superb day one	"Northern Ireland's Kate O'Connor is in second spot after day one of the Commonwealth Games heptathlon following a brilliant series of performances.
O'Connor, 21, set personal bests in the opening 100m hurdles and 200m.
runs came either side of solid high jump and shot put marks which means O'Connor goes into day two second behind Katarina Johnson-Thompson.
English star is 109 points clear but O'Connor is 52 points ahead of third-placed Australian Taneille Crase.
O'Connor set a personal best of 13.74 in the opening 100m hurdles before clearing 1.78m in the high jump which left her fourth at that stage on 1968 points.
As defending champion and favourite Johnson-Thompson produced a below-par shot put, O'Connor's season's best of 13.73m moved her to within 11 points of the 2019 world champion.
mpson-Johnson regrouped with an impressive 200m win in 23.70 to significantly extend her lead but O'Connor's latest personal best of 24.73 - which cut 0.09 seconds off her previous mark - saw her consolidate second spot.
Holly Mills, tipped to be team-mate Johnson-Thompson's closest challenger, could only manage a 200m time of 25.12 which left her 54 points behind O'Connor in fourth spot.
Another English athlete Jade O'Dowda also remains in medal contention, 74 points behind O'Connor, with the second Northern Ireland competitor Anna McCauley is sixth spot nearly 500 points off the pace.
Wednesday's remaining three events are the long jump, the javelin, where O'Connor is normally strong, and the concluding 800m.
It was a mixed day for Northern Ireland's boxers - expected to provide the bulk of the country's medals - as Aidan Walsh stormed into the quarter-finals but team-mate Eugene McKeever exited after sustaining a cut eye early in his fight.
Olympic bronze medallist boxer Walsh dominated his opening light middleweight contest to reach the quarter-finals in Birmingham as he earned a unanimous win over Lesotho's Arena Pakela.
Belfast man's left jab was in Pakela's face throughout the contest as the African simply couldn't get near the Tokyo medallist.
Bafflingly, the Sri Lankan judge only gave Walsh a narrow 29-28 verdict with the other four correctly deciding that the Monkstown club fighter had won conclusively.
Walsh's team-mate McKeever will consider himself extremely unfortunate to have been eliminated in his last-16 contest against Gambia's Stephen Zimba.
Welterweight McKeever sustained a cut above his left eye following an accidental clash of heads in the opening round.
Initially the cut was seen to and the bout was allowed to carry on, until it reopened followed a right hand from the Gambian which prompted the referee to bring a halt to proceedings.
Northern Ireland's men's bowling pair Martin McHugh and Sam Barkley lost their bronze medal match as they were beaten 25-5 by Scotland's Paul Foster and Alex Marshall.
Northern Ireland made a promising start to lead 2-0 after two ends before the Scots quickly took control.
Scottish pair picked up a key five at the third end, followed by a four, a single and another four to lead 14-2, with Northern Ireland unable to mount a comeback. 
Whitehead's McHugh, competing at his seventh Commonwealth Games, was part of Northern Ireland's gold medal-winning fours team in Kuala Lumpur in 1998. 
In the women's triples, Northern Ireland's Ashleigh Rainey, Chloe Wilson and Courtney Meneely beat Falkland Islands 22-10 but NI's women's pair Megan Devlin and Shauna O'Neill lost 14-13 to England.
Gary Kelly won his opening men's singles game as he defeated Norfolk Island's Ryan Dixon 21-12.
In the pool, Daniel Wiffen and Danielle Hill both progressed to finals. 
Armagh man Wiffen comfortably qualified for Wednesday evening's men's 1500m freestyle final, finishing second in his heat in 15 minutes 37.53 seconds.
Wiffen conserved his energy to qualify fifth fastest as his time was almost 40 seconds slower than his Irish record set last month when he just missed out on a place in the final at the World Championships.
A repeat of that sub-15 minute swim could put him in medal contention in Wednesday's final.
Hill reached the women's 50m backstroke final after placing fourth in her semi-final in 28.28 seconds, which left her as seventh qualifier.
kyo Olympian's time cut 0.04 off her morning semi-final performance as she reached her second final at the Games after finishing seventh in the 50m freestyle final.
Barry McClements, after winning Northern Ireland's first ever Commonwealth Games swimming medal on Friday, had to settle for sixth place in the S10 100m butterfly final.
McClements is a S9 swimmer and was taking on S10 competitors who are significantly faster on the clock.
Newtownard man's time of 1:02.95 left him over six seconds behind Australian winner Col Pearse, who led the three S10 swimmers who filled the podium positions.
Mollie McAlorum clocked 31.77 to win her 50m backstroke heat but that time was not enough to qualify, while Grace Davison (30.49) also missed out.

business	Over-50s turn to house-shares to beat rising rents	"rising cost of renting and buying a house has led to more over-50s looking for house and flat-shares, according to property-sharing websites.
It's something that is normally associated with younger people but what is it like sharing when you're over 50?
Karen Miles, 66, moved into a 13-person house five years ago to save money.
She was previously living in a one-bedroom flat just outside Eastbourne but struggled to cover her bills alongside rent of around Â£560 a month. 
Now she pays Â£500 a month for a room, excluding bills, in a shared house in the town. 
Her housemates are a mix of ages, ranging from early-20s to early-50s. While she gets on with everyone, they don't tend to socialise together and Karen, who works part-time as a housekeeper, said sharing with younger people can pose problems. 
She has previously had issues with some flatmates being noisy and the shared kitchen and bathroom can get dirty quickly. 
However, she said there were also benefits of having other people around to chat to. 
""If I moved in somewhere on my own, I think I probably would feel a bit lonely,"" she added. 
Karen has tried to look for a one-bedroom flat to rent but with prices increasing she has struggled to find something affordable. 
She would also like to share with friends but said it can be difficult for older people to find someone of a similar age to rent with. 
""My friends have got husbands and family so it's hard,"" she said. 
Leading flat-sharing site SpareRoom said it had seen a 239% increase in 55 to 64-year-olds looking for house-shares since 2011 and a 114% increase for the 45-to-54 age group. 
However people aged 25 to 34 years old still make up the majority of sharers. 
Meanwhile, Cohabitas, a site for over-40s, said it had seen a 51% increase in users aged 55 to 64. 
SpareRoom communications director Matt Hutchinson said the primary reason more older people were house-sharing was affordability. 
He told BBC News the increased cost of renting and buying a home meant more people were sharing for longer and becoming ""lifetime renters"", while people who had come out of long-term relationships and might originally have bought or rented a one-bedroom flat were now ""priced out"". 
Mr Hutchinson said he expected the trend to continue as housing and other costs increased further. 
Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said official figures also suggest renters are getting older. 
She added that figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest the cost of living crisis is felt more by renters than homeowners, as they spend a greater proportion of their income on housing. 
re also more exposed to rent increases as many mortgage-holders are on fixed rates. 
Rental prices in the UK have been increasing steadily since Covid restrictions were eased in the summer of 2021, according to the ONS. 
High demand has contributed to rental prices increasing by 3.2% in the 12 months to July - the largest annual growth rate since January 2016.
For April to June, property website Rightmove found average asking rents outside London hit a record Â£1,126 per month - up 11.8% on the same period last year. 
Cohabitas, a website which advertises house-shares for people over-40, also said it had seen increased demand from older age groups since it was founded in 2016. 
Over the past six months, it said it had seen a 44% increase in users compared to the same period last year. 
For 55 to 64-year-olds the increase was 51%, while for 45 to 54-year-olds it was 35%.  
Co-founder Eva Orasch said the long-term trends driving the increase in sharing among older age groups were the UK's ageing population and increased house prices. 
In the short-term, she said the rising cost of living and the pandemic were also contributing, with some people no longer wanting to live alone after lockdown. 
In a 2021 survey of more than 1,500 users, the website found 45% of respondents had chosen to share for purely financial reasons, while 48% were sharing for both financial and social reasons. 
Susan Laybourn, 58, also started house-sharing to save money in March 2020. 
Most recently she has been sharing with a live-in landlady who is a similar age to her, as well as a man in his 20s, in Trefnant, north Wales. 
After getting a job in the area, Susan, who works as a locum podiatrist for the NHS, could not find anywhere affordable to rent on her own. 
Many houses in the area are let as holiday homes and Susan said demand for rented properties already outstripped supply. 
""At one point, I did consider just trying to find somewhere on my own and there was a couple of flats going in Rhyl, which is nearby,"" she said. 
""But by the time I rang up to inquire about them they said 'oh, sorry, they're already gone'.""
She added that not having a permanent job and often needing a shorter-term rental contract because of this also counted against her when trying to find somewhere to rent. 
Ideally, Susan said she would prefer to live alone or with just one other person her own age - and she could afford to do so - but it was much cheaper to share. Her current room is Â£400 a month including bills. 
""If I could find anywhere here on my own I'd probably be paying at least Â£200 more just for the rent, and then you've got bills on top,"" she said. 
""And when you hear about energy bills are going to go through the roof and everything, I think I'm glad I'm not private renting [on my own] because I feel like I'd just be wasting money, when I could be saving it.""
She would also like to buy her own flat in the future but believes her age and lack of permanent job means she would not be able to get a mortgage. 
Susan said she did enjoy having company, especially when moving to a new area, and she gets on well with her live-in landlady. 
However, she said it can be hard to find someone her own age to share with as there is still a stigma associated with older people house-sharing. 
In the past she said she felt ""almost ashamed"" that she was not able to rent her own place. 
""I've kind of come to terms with it now and try to see the positives in it, rather than the negatives."""	/news/business-62344571
technology	What are NFTs and why are some worth millions?	"Former US President Donald Trump has launched a collection of digital trading cards depicting him in various guises including a superhero, astronaut and Nascar driver.
rds are being offered as a ""non-fungible token"" (NFT), a way of owning the original digital image.
Where Bitcoin was hailed as the digital answer to currency, NFTs are now being touted as the digital answer to collectables, but plenty of sceptics fear they're a bubble waiting to burst.
In economics, a fungible asset is something with units that can be readily interchanged - like money.
With money, you can swap a Â£10 note for two Â£5 notes and it will have the same value.
However, if something is non-fungible, this is impossible - it means it has unique properties so it can't be interchanged with something else.
It could be a house, or a painting such as the Mona Lisa, which is one of a kind. You can take a photo of the painting or buy a print but there will only ever be one original painting.
NFTs are ""one-of-a-kind"" assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold like any other piece of property, but which have no tangible form of their own. 
gital tokens can be thought of as certificates of ownership for virtual or physical assets.
raditional works of art such as paintings are valuable precisely because they are one of a kind.
But digital files can be easily and endlessly duplicated.
With NFTs, artwork can be ""tokenised"" to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought and sold.
Will digital-only trading cards replace physical ones?
As with crypto-currency, a record of who owns what is stored on a shared ledger known as the blockchain.
records cannot be forged because the ledger is maintained by thousands of computers around the world.
NFTs can also contain smart contracts that may give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.
In theory, anybody can tokenise their work to sell as an NFT but interest has been fuelled by headlines of multi-million-dollar sales.
An animated Gif of Nyan Cat - a 2011 meme of a flying pop-tart cat - sold for more than $500,000 (Â£365,000).
A few weeks later, musician Grimes sold some of her digital art for more than $6m. 
It is not just art that is tokenised and sold. Twitter's founder Jack Dorsey has promoted an NFT of the first-ever tweet, with bids hitting $2.5m. 
Christie's sale of an NFT by digital artist Beeple for $69m (Â£50m) set a new record for digital art.
French firm Sorare, which sells football trading cards in the form of NFTs, has raised $680m (Â£498m).
But as with crypto-currencies, there are concerns about the environmental impact of maintaining the blockchain.  
Nothing. Millions of people have seen Beeple's art that sold for $69m and the image has been copied and shared countless times.
In many cases, the artist even retains the copyright ownership of their work, so they can continue to produce and sell copies.
But the buyer of the NFT owns a ""token"" that proves they own the ""original"" work. 
Some people compare it to buying an autographed print. 
A day before his record-breaking auction, Beeple - whose real name is Mike Winkelmann - told the BBC: ""I actually do think there will be a bubble, to be quite honest. 
""And I think we could be in that bubble right now."" 
Many are even more sceptical. 
David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain, said he saw NFTs as buying ""official collectables"", similar to trading cards. 
""There are some artists absolutely making bank on this stuff... it's just that you probably won't,"" he warned. 
ually selling the NFTs are ""crypto-grifters"", he said. 
""The same guys who've always been at it, trying to come up with a new form of worthless magic bean that they can sell for money."" 
Former Christie's auctioneer Charles Allsopp said the concept of buying NFTs made ""no sense"".
""The idea of buying something which isn't there is just strange,"" he told the BBC.
""I think people who invest in it are slight mugs, but I hope they don't lose their money."""	/news/technology-56371912
business	China Covid: Angry protests at giant iPhone factory in Zhengzhou	"WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory
Protests have erupted at the world's biggest iPhone factory in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, according to footage circulated widely online.
Videos show hundreds of workers marching, with some confronted by people in hazmat suits and riot police.
reaming the protests said workers were beaten by police. Videos also showed clashes.
Manufacturer Foxconn said it would work with staff and local government to prevent further violence.
In its statement, the firm said some workers had doubts about pay but that the firm would fulfil pay based on contracts.
It also described as ""patently untrue"" rumours that new recruits were being asked to share dormitories with workers who were Covid-positive.
Dormitories were disinfected and checked by local officials before new people moved in, Foxconn said.
Last month, rising Covid cases saw the site locked down, prompting some workers to break out and go home. The company then recruited new workers with the promise of generous bonuses.
Footage shared on a livestreaming site showed workers shouting: ""Defend our rights! Defend our rights!"" 
Other workers were seen smashing surveillance cameras and windows with sticks.
""They changed the contract so that we could not get the subsidy as they had promised. They quarantine us but don't provide food,"" said one Foxconn worker during his live stream. 
""If they do not address our needs, we will keep fighting.""
He also claimed to have seen a man ""severely injured"" after a beating from police.
One employee who recently started working at the Zhengzhou plant also told the BBC workers were protesting because Foxconn had ""changed the contract they promised"".
He said some newly recruited workers feared getting Covid from staff who had been there during the earlier outbreak. 
""Those workers who are protesting are wanting to get a subsidy and return home,"" the staff member said.
re was a heavy police deployment to the plant on Wednesday morning, he said. Other livestreamed videos also showed crowds of armed police at the site.
Another newly recruited employee told the BBC he visited the protest scene on Wednesday where he saw ""one man with blood over his head lying on the ground"".
""I didn't know the exact reason why people are protesting but they are mixing us new workers with old workers who were [Covid] positive,"" he told the BBC.
Foxconn, a Taiwanese firm, is Apple's main subcontractor and its Zhengzhou plant assembles more iPhones than anywhere else in the world.
In late October many workers fled the plant amid rising Covid cases and allegations of poor treatment of staff. 
r escape was captured on social media as they rode lorries back to their hometowns elsewhere in the central Chinese province.
firm has since enacted so-called closed loop operations at the plant - keeping it isolated from the wider city of Zhengzhou because of a Covid outbreak there.
Earlier this month Apple said it expected lower shipments of iPhone 14 models because of the disruption to production in Zhengzhou."	/news/world-asia-china-63725812
politics	NI Protocol: Poots' suspension of Brexit checks unlawful, court rules	"Edwin Poots' instruction to halt checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from GB was unlawful and taken for political reasons, the High Court has ruled.
urt quashed the instruction of the former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) agriculture minister.  
DUP opposes the Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposed the checks.
A challenge to the legality of the order was brought by a Sinn FÃ©in member, another applicant named Edward Rooney, and Belfast City Council.  
Mr Poots was agriculture minister when he issued the instruction in February 2022, shortly before the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed when the DUP withdrew its first minister in protest against the protocol. 
Since January 2021, food products being sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have required a range of checks and controls due to the protocol.
rotocol is a deal between the UK and EU which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding the need for a hard border with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.
Unionist politicians have condemned what they regard as the imposition of a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Mr Poots said he had received legal advice that he could direct a halt to the checks in the absence of approval for the inspections from the wider Stormont Executive.
At the High Court on Thursday, Mr Justice Colton found the wider executive did not need to approve the checks.
""It is difficult to draw conclusion other than the decision under challenge was an overtly political one, taken for political reasons, and as part of a political campaign directed in opposition to the protocol,"" he said.
By Louise Cullen, BBC News NI agriculture and environment correspondent
judge's comments that Edwin Poots' instruction was ""overtly political"" will come as no surprise to those who have watched the former agriculture minister and his DUP colleagues collapse the assembly in their opposition to the legislation that seeks to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.  
judge recognised there was political opposition to the protocol, but said ""any politically motivated decision"" that was not in accordance with the law was ""unsustainable and must be set aside as a consequence"".
It's a fair bet that, had Mr Poots still been in place, there would be further court action to follow after this decision.  
As it is, it remains to be seen what steps the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs will now take in the absence of a minister.  
formally quash an instruction that never took effect comes as London and Brussels hold more talks to try to resolve the impasse, and after figures this week showed sales to GB had increased in the year since the protocol began to be implemented. 
He said the instruction had been issued at a time when the then DUP First Minister Paul Givan's resignation was imminent, and consistent with the party's previously declared strategy of opposition to the protocol.
""It may well be that for politicians, as the DUP leader said in September 2021 'there are no easy answers when the law requires one thing and politics demands something else',"" the judge said.
""From the court's perspective there is an easy answer and that is that the law must be obeyed.
""Any politically-motivated decision that is in accordance with the law is unimpeachable.
""Every such decision which does not satisfy this indelible standard is unsustainable in law and must be set aside as a consequence.""
Formally quashing Mr Poots' order to staff, Mr Justice Colton confirmed: ""By issuing the instruction on 2 February 2022, the minister was in breach of his legal obligations.
""The instruction was unlawful and of no effect.""
Despite Mr Poots' instruction, border checks on agri-food products entering Northern Ireland have been continuing pending the outcome of the judicial review proceedings.
Anonymity was granted to the Sinn FÃ©in member who brough the challenge because of fears he might be targeted by loyalist paramilitaries."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63983399
entertainment	Mobo Awards: Little Simz and Knucks tie for best album prize	"Rappers Little Simz and Knucks have been named joint winners of the best album prize at this year's Mobo Awards.
It was the first-ever tie in the 25-year history of the awards, which celebrate black music and culture.
win was a further accolade for Simz' intensely personal Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, which won last month's Mercury Prize last month.
Knucks was honoured for his jazz-rap debut, Alpha Place, named after the London estate he grew up on.
Judges said ""both artists showed where British rap can go, both production-wise and lyrically"".
remony also saw R&B star Craig David and Chic legend Nile Rodgers win lifetime achievement awards.
On stage at London's Wembley Arena, David dedicated his award to his father, George.
""Thank you to my dad, who was part of the Windrush era,"" he said. ""He came over to this country and he experienced racism, he experienced being bullied... but he nurtured me and showed me love. 
""He always said to me, 'Never dim your light'. And I love you dad for that, because that's served me so well throughout my life.""
r's honour came 22 years after his first Mobo win, for best newcomer, in 2000.
""I feel the same way I did back then - just really thankful,"" he told BBC News.
""But I know that the bit in between, which we call life, has been the most beautiful thing - and I would never change it for the world.""
Rodgers, the New York musician whose credits include Madonna's Like A Virgin, David Bowie's Let's Dance and BeyoncÃ©'s Cuff It, said he had always felt at home in London.
""The UK has always supported me and always supported my efforts when sometimes in America racism played a part in my development,"" he said. ""I always say to people, I have been swimming upstream my entire life.""
He went on to close the show with a medley of his hits, from Chic's Le Freak to Daft Punk's Get Lucky.
Elsewhere at the ceremony, London rapper Central Cee made good on his 2021 best newcomer award, returning to the ceremony to pick up best male artist and video of the year, for his provocative street anthem Doja.
BBC Sound of 2022 winner PinkPantheress was named best female, recognising the home-spun, sample-heavy of  hits like Just For Me and Break It Off.
r's Mobos also featured two new categories - best alternative act and best dance/electronic act - in response to calls for the awards to diversify.
Jungle musician Nia Archives led the campaign, posting an open letter in April saying it was ""frustrating"" that the ceremony didn't represent ""black music in all its forms"".
When the new categories were announced, she was among the nominees - and ultimately won best dance/electronic artist.
""I weren't expecting that, I can't lie,"" said the Bradford-born musician. ""Jungle is music of black origin and I'm proud to be flying the flag for my community and my scene.""
Best alternative act went to grime-punk duo Bob Vylan, whose gripping second album The Price Of Life is a furious polemic about wealth inequality and the cost of living crisis.
""There's a lot of anger in it, but it's righteous anger,"" singer and guitarist Bobby Vylan told BBC News. ""If you look at the news on any given day, the people of Britain should be angry with what's going on.
""We're working-class musicians. We're on the ground, we're not removed from any of the struggle. We're here at an award show but we've got to pay our rent.""
Nigerian superstar Burna Boy claimed two prizes, winning best international and best African act; while D-Block Europe won best hip-hop.
Song of the year went to dancer-turned-musician Dreya Mac for her viral smash Own Brand (Baddie).
Best known for the line ""I ain't never been with a baddie"", her imminently-quotable earworm became a sensation on TiKTok last year, ultimately soundtracking more than eight million videos.
Knucks, aka north London rapper Ashley Nwachukwu, went into the ceremony with the most nominations - five in total.
Although the shared best album trophy was his only victory, the musician was happy with the result.
""It's definitely validating"" he told BBC News. ""I feel like I've been doing this for a long time, so to finally have people acknowledge all the effort I put in really feels good.""
He described his album as ""an origin story that shows where I came from and what kind of person I am"".
Kane Robinson - aka rapper Kano - won best performance in a TV show for his role as drug kingpin Sully in the Netflix drama Top Boy. 
Reflecting on how his life had changed since winning best newcomer at the 2005 Mobos, the star had some advice for his fellow musicians. 
""I just want to say to all artists that have other interests - you can do what you [expletive] want. 
""No boxes, no boundaries. Your artistry don't stop in one medium. If you're interested in something else, do it.""
BBC One will show highlights from the ceremony - including performances by Kojey Radical, Fireboy DML, Cat Burns and FLO - in a special programme next Wednesday, 7 December.

politics	MPs reject Christmas parties on expenses	"Parliament's expenses watchdog is facing a backlash from MPs after it told them they can claim for the cost of an office Christmas party.
Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) announced MPs can this year claim for food, decorations and non-alcoholic drinks.
But MPs on all sides have rejected the guidance, with one calling it ""bonkers"" amid a cost of living crisis.
Ipsa said holding a ""modest gathering"" for staff was ""entirely appropriate"". 
But a spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he wouldn't be claiming for a party, and that MPs would have to ""justify all spending to their constituents"".
Labour MPs have been told it would ""clearly be inappropriate"" for them to claim for Christmas parties at a time of rising living costs.
John Cryer, chair of the parliamentary Labour Party, said he would be writing to Ipsa to ask them to reconsider their guidance.
Labour frontbencher Jess Phillips said: ""The guidance wasn't made by MPs and yet we will be pilloried for it.
""I think it's really irresponsible to issue this guidance as if MPs have been clamouring for it when I've literally never heard anyone do that.""
Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Wendy Chamberlain said none of her party's MPs would be claiming, adding ""in the middle of a cost of living crisis this is tone deaf from Ipsa"".
Conservative Former Brexit secretary David Davis called the rules ""bonkers"" and said Ipsa had ""missed the mood of the age"".
In a statement, Ipsa defended its approach, saying MPs' staff worked in a ""challenging"" environment and often had to deal with ""distressing"" casework from constituents.
""As employers, it is entirely appropriate that MPs should, if they see fit, reward their staff with a modest gathering at Christmas,"" the statement added. 
""We are clear that alcohol is not included, that any event must represent value for money, is subject to publication for transparency and must not be party political in nature. It must be funded within existing budgets.""
""To suggest that there is anything inappropriate in this is simply incorrect.""
rganisation added that it had produced the guidance in response to requests from MPs for clarification on its expenses policy. 
uthority - which was set up in the wake of the 2009 MPs' expenses scandal - is funded by the Treasury, which in turn raises most of its funds through taxes.
In its update, the body said MPs would be able to claim for ""festive office events"" for staff - but ""value for money should be considered and all claims will be published in the usual manner"".
Ipsa added that all claims ""should represent value for money, especially in the current economic climate"". Claims have to be parliamentary in nature and should not be party-political.
uthority said it would also approve claims of money spent on sending cards to local residents. 
But MPs were explicitly told they cannot use their expenses for a festive or new year calendar, decorations outside their constituency offices, or spend taxpayers' money on alcohol.
Any Christmas cards claimed for must not be sent to ""large groups or all constituents as there is a risk this may not represent value for money and could be considered self-promotional""."	/news/uk-politics-63714892
health	Londonderry: Future of Shantallow GP practice in doubt	"A Londonderry GP practice is at risk of closure after it handed its contract back to the Department of Health.
rtment said it was working to ensure an alternative service is put in place for the patients who attend the Racecourse Medical Group practice.
It confirmed that the department would retain the contract to deliver services for the next six months.
A recruitment process would now begin to put other arrangements in place, the department have said.
""Patients at the practice do not need to take any action,"" the department told BBC Radio Foyle. 
It will now be writing to all practice patients in the Shantallow practice to keep them informed as the process begins.
It is understood GPs at the Racecourse Road practice in Shantallow have decided to hand the contract to the strategic planning and performance group (SPPG) ahead of the retirement of a partner.
""The news that the management of the Racecourse Medical Group have handed back the contract is causing extreme concern for people in this area,"" Social Democratic and Labour Party councillor Brian Tierney said. 
""People have built relationships with the staff who provide an excellent standard of care and people in this community would be devastated to see it close.
""While the surgery will continue to operate as normal for at least the next six months, we need to see urgent action from the Department of Health to find new management so that it can continue to provide services to people in this area.""
move comes as one of Northern Ireland's largest GP practices, Maple Healthcare in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh, is at risk of closure after its operator handed its contract back to the department.
On Friday, two surgeries in Ballymena also indicated that they intended to resign affecting about 7,000 patients.
""It is very worrying when we hear it in specific areas, it's worrying when we hear it happening right across Northern Ireland,"" the British Medical Association (BMA) said.
Dr Alan Stout from the organisation said more and more practices were ""really struggling to cope, struggling to keep doors open, struggling to pay staff and also struggling to keep up with demand"".
""We are hearing far too frequently from all areas that practices are simply saying that they can't deal with it anymore and are handing back their contracts,"" he added. 
Dr Stout said as soon as a GP practice handed its contract back the ""clock starts ticking"".
""In most cases it will be six months until a contract is actually advertised after it has been handed back,"" he said.
""Everybody will then try their best to get a new contractor, like a new GP, or it might be an agreement with other practices... or worst case scenario patients will then be allocated to other practices.""
Across Northern Ireland, the number of GP practices has fallen by just under 9% in eight years according to Department of Health Figures.
Belfast - Flax Medical Centre, Belfast, County Antrim
Northern - Ballymena Family Practice, Ballymena, County Antrim
South Eastern - Priory Surgery, Holywood, County Down

business	Investment cuts could threaten levelling up, warns infrastructure tsar	"government's targets for ""levelling up"" and ""net zero"" are at risk if too much investment spending is cut in the Autumn Statement, its top adviser on infrastructure has warned.
f the National Infrastructure Commission told the BBC it was crucial the government stuck to its policies.
Sir John Armitt said cutting back on the HS2 rail route would be ""silly"".
Last week, the government confirmed that much infrastructure spending was under review.
On Thursday, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will unveil his Autumn Statement - a Budget in all but name - and he has already said that he faces decisions of ""eye-watering difficulty"".  
Speaking to the BBC, Sir John said: ""Clearly we're in a very difficult situation. The chancellor has real challenges and therefore one can understand there might be some pressure on infrastructure.
""On the other hand infrastructure is seen as being the economic driver for many parts of the country, particularly those parts of the country which are looking to level up.
""It's so important that government doesn't flip flop, it sticks to its ambition, it sticks to its policies, so that the private sector will bring in a lot of capital, which creates jobs and opportunity. 
""To cut back on HS2 would be frankly very silly,"" he added. ""I think you've got massive investment, which has happened in Birmingham ahead of HS2 - it just shows what can happen. And Manchester of course equally is now seeing investment off the back of HS2. I think that would be a very strange decision."" 
He said that scheme and the Integrated Rail Review were ""very important for levelling up"".
Some economists anticipate that the government will squeeze investment spending on Thursday because in history it has been seen as the easiest ""big ticket"" spending item for the Treasury to delay.
re has also been a relative boost to investment spending at the very beginning of this Parliament under the initial premiership of Boris Johnson up to above Â£70bn a year in public sector net investment.
But Sir John disputed the idea there had been an infrastructure boom, saying: ""If you look at the numbers, there's been a decrease in investment in the last couple of years, not a ramp up. There's been talk of a ramp up and that's why it's important to maintain that belief that there needs to be a ramp up.""
With COP27 climate talks still ongoing, Sir John also expressed concern about the delivery of investment required to hit net zero targets for carbon emissions, saying the UK risked falling behind other countries.
""If everybody stuck to the policies, we'd get to net zero. The actual delivery is where we're falling down. So we can't afford to take our foot off the pedal, we've got to keep going, otherwise we will not get to net zero."""	/news/business-63624768
business	Government proposes more help for energy-intensive firms	"government is considering a plan to provide more help to energy-intensive industries in the face of soaring electricity prices.
roposal could mean lower energy bills for firms in the steel, paper, glass, ceramics, and cement sectors.
In April, the government expanded its support for firms that use large amounts of electricity.
But the business secretary said it was ""essential"" to explore ways of further cutting production costs. 
""British manufacturers are the lifeblood of our economy and central to our plans to overcome this period of economic uncertainty,"" Kwasi Kwarteng said. 
""With global energy prices at record highs, it is essential we explore what more we can do to deliver a competitive future for those strategic industries.""
government will launch a consultation on proposals that would remove altogether the obligation to pay certain environmental and policy costs.
Director-general of UK Steel Gareth Stace welcomed the consultation, saying it should provide ""some much-needed relief in the face of extremely challenging circumstances"".
""This announcement demonstrates that the UK government understands the challenges of British industry and continues to support steelmakers and steel communities across the country.""
Some support for these sectors is already in place. The Energy Intensive Industries Exemption Scheme grants firms 85% relief on a range of environmental and policy levies that are added to electricity bills.

entertainment	Ed Sheeran must face copyright trial over Thinking Out Loud, judge rules	"Pop star Ed Sheeran has been ordered to stand trial in the US over claims he copied his hit song Thinking Out Loud from Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On.
A judge denied Sheeran's bid to dismiss the case, saying a jury should decide on the similarities between the songs.
move comes six months after Sheeran was cleared of copying his hit song Shape Of You at a trial in London.
After that ruling, the singer hit out at ""baseless"" copyright claims, which he said were ""way too common"".
m over Thinking Out Loud was originally lodged in 2018, not by Gaye's family but by investment banker David Pullman and a company called Structured Asset Sales, which has acquired a portion of the estate of Let's Get It On co-writer Ed Townsend.
Seeking $100m (Â£90m) in damages, they allege that Sheeran and his co-writer Amy Wadge ""copied and exploited, without authorisation or credit"" the Gaye song, ""including but not limited to the melody, rhythms, harmonies, drums, bass line, backing chorus, tempo, syncopation and looping"".
On Thursday, US District Judge Louis Stanton cited a disagreement between musical experts on both sides of the lawsuit as a reason for ordering the civil trial.
WATCH: Ed Sheeran sits down for exclusive interview about Shape Of You copyright lawsuit
rospect of a jury trial will be an unwelcome one for Sheeran. Copyright lawyers have often argued that juries have difficulty understanding the complexities of copyright law, and why superficial similarities between two songs are not necessarily proof of plagiarism.
In his order, Judge Stanton also ruled that jurors must decide whether SAS can include concert revenue in damages, rejecting Sheeran's argument that ticket sales weren't tied to the alleged infringement.
Sheeran's 2014-2015 tour earned $150m (Â£135m), according to music industry trade publication Pollstar.
His lawyers did not comment on the judge's ruling. A lawyer for Structured Asset Sales, Hillel Parness, told Reuters the company was ""pleased"" with the ruling.
rial Sheeran is facing over Thinking Out Loud, which went to number one in the UK in 2014 and won song of the year at the Grammy Awards in 2016.
SAS has filed a second case, which is currently on pause, while a separate suit by another portion of Townsend's estate is awaiting trial.
At the Shape of You a trial in March, the singer and his co-writers John McDaid and Steven McCutcheon faced accusations that a hook on their track ripped off Oh Why, a 2015 song by Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue.
However, a High Court judge concluded they had ""neither deliberately nor subconsciously"" plagiarised the earlier song, and awarded the star and his co-defendants Â£900,000 in costs.
Afterwards, Sheeran declared on Instagram: ""I hope that this ruling means in the future baseless claims like this can be avoided. This really does have to end.""
He added: ""It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music. Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That's 22 million songs a year, and there's only 12 notes that are available."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63087419

health	December strike by NHS nurses is biggest in their history	"Nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are to strike for two days next month in what is set to be their biggest walkout in the NHS's history.
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) announced strikes on 15 and 20 December in its pay dispute with the government.
Nurses will still provide emergency care, but routine services will be hit.
RCN said it had been given no choice after ministers would not reopen talks, but the government said the 19% pay rise demanded was unaffordable.
RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: ""Ministers have chosen strike action.
""Nursing staff have had enough of being taken for granted, enough of low pay and unsafe staffing levels, enough of not being able to give our patients the care they deserve.""
Under trade union laws, the RCN has to ensure life-preserving care is provided during the strikes, which will last from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT.
Watch this video quiz to test your knowledge of nurses' pay
kely to mean some urgent cancer services, urgent tests and scans and ongoing care for vulnerable patients will be protected alongside A&E and intensive care - although it will be up to local health bosses and union leaders to negotiate exact staffing levels on strike days.
Share your experiences. Get in touch.
But it seems almost certain the walkout will increase the backlog in non-urgent hospital treatment - a record seven million people are already on the waiting list in England.
Louise Ansari, from the Healthwatch England patient watchdog, said she was ""concerned"" about the impact on this group of patients.
Hospital nurse Shaun Williams only started working as a nurse a year ago.
He said the thought of striking makes him sad, but he is prepared to do it.
""I am sorry we are having to do this. 
""But we are doing it for the right reasons, we are doing it for patient safety.
""You are running on reserves most days. We do not have enough staff and because of the lack of nurses, patients are at risk.
""Unless we pay nurses more we are not going to attract people or keep people.""
And he says unless the situation changes he may even quit nursing.
GP services, however, will be unaffected as nurses working in practices were not entitled to take part in the ballot.
And because a series of individual ballots were held at NHS trusts and boards rather than one national ballot, nurses at more than 40% of England's hospitals, mental health and community services are not entitled to strike because the turnout was too low in those votes.
However, walkouts can happen at all of Northern Ireland's health boards and in all-but-one in Wales, the Aneurin Bevan.
What is not clear yet is just how many of the services where strike action can take place will see walkouts. 
It is possible the RCN could stagger the action so some services go on strike in December, with others to follow suit next year if the industrial action continues.
It is seen by the union as a way of limiting the disruption to patients, while keeping the pressure on the government.
Individual NHS trusts and boards will not find out until next week whether they will see walkouts on the two dates, because that is when the formal notices will go out.
RCN has called for a rise of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which currently stands at above 14%, but no UK nation has offered close to that.
In England and Wales, NHS staff, including nurses, have been given a rise of at least Â£1,400 - worth about 4% on average for nurses.
In Northern Ireland, nurses are yet to receive a pay award because there is no working government.
Strike action has been suspended in Scotland however after the government there made a fresh offer worth more than 8% for a newly-qualified nurse. More senior nurses are being offered less. The RCN said it was considering the offer.
During the ballot, the results of which were announced two weeks ago, the RCN had argued this year's below-inflation pay award came after years of squeezes on nurse's salaries. 
But England Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the RCN's demands were not affordable, adding he ""deeply regretted"" union members would be taking action.
He pointed out the government had met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in giving its award.
And it followed a 3% pay rise last year, in recognition of work during the pandemic, despite a public-sector pay freeze.
""Our priority is keeping patients safe. The NHS has tried and tested plans in place to minimise disruption,"" he added.
Welsh government said it was unable to enter pay talks without extra funding from the UK government.
Labour shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said talks should restart - although he would not commit to paying the above-inflation pay rise the RCN was seeking.
""Why on earth is the health secretary refusing to negotiate with nurses? Patients will never forgive the Conservatives for this negligence.""
will only be the second time RCN members have been on strike.
In 2019, nurses in Northern Ireland walked out over pay, while nurses who are members of Unison in England walked out in 2014 over pay.
A host of other major health unions, including Unison, the Royal College of Midwives, GMB and Unite, have all started balloting members."	/news/health-63746334

business	Pound hits new 37-year low as retail sales slide	"und has fallen to a new 37-year low against the US dollar after figures showed UK retail sales fell sharply in August as the rise in the cost of living continued to hit households.
rger-than-expected drop in sales volumes of 1.6% prompted fresh concerns over the state of the economy.
Sales across all retail sectors fell in August as households cut back in the face of rising prices.
One analyst suggested the figures showed the UK is already in recession.
Sterling fell more than 1% against the dollar to $1.1351 at one point, its lowest since 1985, following the release of the retail sales figures. The pound recovered later to climb above $1.14. 
und has been falling against the US currency for most of the year, partly due to the strength of the dollar. A weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far.
mes at a time when UK inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, is running at a near 40-year high, despite slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%.
Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year and it is expected to keep increasing interest rates in a bid to curb inflation.
Olivia Cross, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said August's retail sales figures backed up the consultancy's view that the UK economy is ""already in recession"".
A recession is defined by the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. 
""Retail sales will probably continue to struggle as the cost of living crisis hits harder in the coming months,"" Ms Cross said.
""But nonetheless the Bank of England will still have to raise interest rates aggressively.""
Higher prices, along with upcoming energy bill rises in October, have led households to tighten their belts when it comes to spending.
government announced the Energy Price Guarantee last week to help people with energy bills. The support will see annual energy bill for a typical household capped at Â£2,500 for two years.
rgy bills were set to rise to Â£3,549 a year and even higher in 2023, before the government intervened.
Ms Cross, of Capital Economics, said that because of the intervention, any recession would be ""smaller and shorter"" than it had expected previously.
Martyn Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the government support  ""should ease both the income squeeze and lift consumers' sentiment, suggesting the outlook for retailers isn't as gloomy as could have been the case"".
""However, real household incomes are still on course for a significant fall over the next 12 months or so,"" he added.
government is expected to set out the estimated cost of plans to cap energy prices in a ""mini-Budget"" next Friday, as well as tax cuts pledged by Prime Minister Liz Truss in a bid to boost the economy.
Sterling's fall to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar today is not isolated. The pound also hit its weakest level against the euro for nearly a year and a half.
So while the big picture movement is strength in the US dollar, there continues to be specific additional pressure on the pound sterling in international markets.
morning's trigger was far weaker than expected retail sales figures. But markets await next Friday and the extent of borrowing required for the government's energy plan and tax cuts.
urozone too is heading for recession, but there is little comfort in such company.
risk is that a weaker currency, makes imports of essentials, from energy to food, more expensive, prolonging the period of high inflation. And if the UK's nearest trading partners are also in recession, exporters will not see significant benefit from a weaker pound.
fall in retail sales continues the slide since the summer of 2021, when all Covid restrictions were removed, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The drop seen in August was the largest month-on-month fall since December 2021.
Sales of food, online, non-food and fuel all fell in the month, the ONS said.
Supermarkets' sales volumes also fell by 0.9% in August, but alcohol and tobacco sales rose by 6.3%.
""Feedback from retailers suggests that consumers are cutting back on spending because of increased prices and affordability concerns,"" the ONS said.
Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, said people were ""clearly thinking hard about what they spend their money on"".
""It's just not stretching as far as it used to, and essentials have to come first. But even essentials are costing more and with the spectre of unmanageable fuel bills looming large people did the only thing they could, cut back,"" she said.
According to the ONS, department stores saw a large drop in sales in August - 2.7% - while sales in clothing shops fell by 0.6%.
""Big ticket purchases are being put off and that's unlikely to change in the coming months,"" said AJ Bell's Ms Hewson.
On Thursday, John Lewis revealed that while its shopper numbers were higher than last year, customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items.
rtment store and its supermarket chain Waitrose reported a loss of Â£99m for the first half of its trading year. Waitrose said it sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes shrinking by ""nearly a fifth"".
Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the main factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills.
Meanwhile, the proportion of retail sales online fell to 25.7% in August from 26.3% in July, but the figure remains significantly above pre-pandemic levels. "	/news/business-62923994

technology	Uber Files: Massive leak reveals how top politicians secretly helped Uber	"usands of leaked files have exposed how Uber courted top politicians, and how far it went to avoid justice.
xtensive help Uber got from leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and ex-EU commissioner Neelie Kroes.
w how the taxi firm's former boss personally ordered the use of a ""kill switch"" to prevent raiding police from accessing computers.
Uber says its ""past behaviour wasn't in line with present values"" and it is a ""different company"" today.
Uber Files are a trove of more than 124,000 records, including 83,000 emails and 1,000 other files involving conversations, spanning 2013 to 2017. 
were leaked to the Guardian, and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and a number of media organisations including BBC Panorama. They reveal, for the first time, how a $90m-a-year lobbying and public relations effort recruited friendly politicians to help in its campaign to disrupt Europe's taxi industry. 
While French taxi drivers staged sometimes violent protests in the streets against Uber, Mr Macron - now president - was on first name terms with Uber's controversial boss Travis Kalanick, and told him he would reform laws in the firm's favour.
Uber's ruthless business methods were widely known, but for the first time the files give a unique inside view of the lengths it went to in achieving its goals. 
w how ex-EU digital commissioner Neelie Kroes, one of Brussels' top officials, was in talks to join Uber before her term ended - and then secretly lobbied for the firm, in potential breach of EU ethics rules.
At the time, Uber was not just one of the world's fastest-growing companies - it was one of the most controversial, dogged by court cases, allegations of sexual harassment, and data breach scandals.
Eventually shareholders had enough, and Travis Kalanick was forced out in 2017.
Uber says his replacement, Dara Khosrowshahi, was ""tasked with transforming every aspect of how Uber operates"" and has ""installed the rigorous controls and compliance necessary to operate as a public company"".
Paris was the scene of Uber's first European launch, and it met stiff resistance from the taxi industry, culminating in violent protests in the streets.
In August 2014, an ambitious former banker named Emmanuel Macron had just been appointed minister for the economy. He saw Uber as a source of growth and badly needed new jobs, and was keen to help.
October, he held a meeting with Mr Kalanick and other executives and lobbyists, which marked the start of a long - but little-publicised - stint as a champion of the controversial firm's interests within government.
Uber lobbyist Mark MacGann described the meeting as ""spectacular. Like I've never seen,"" the files show. ""We will dance soon,"" he added.
""Emmanuel"" and ""Travis"" were soon on first name terms, and met at least four times, the files show - in Paris, and at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland. Only the Davos meeting has been previously reported.
At one point Uber wrote to Mr Macron saying it was ""extremely grateful"". ""The openness and welcome we receive is unusual in government-industry relations.""
French taxi drivers were particularly enraged by the 2014 launch of UberPop - a service that allowed unlicensed drivers to offer rides, at much lower prices. 
Courts and parliament banned it, but Uber kept the service running as it challenged the law.
Mr Macron didn't think there was a future for UberPop, but he agreed to work with the company to rewrite France's laws governing its other services.
""Uber will provide an outline for a regulatory framework for ridesharing. We will connect our respective teams to start working on a feasible proposal that could become the formal framework in France,"" an email from Travis Kalanick to Mr Macron reads.
On 25 June 2015, the protests became violent, and a week later Mr Macron texted Mr Kalanick with an apparent offer of help. 
""[I] will gather everybody next week to prepare the reform and correct the law.""
me day, Uber announced the suspension of UberPop in France.
xtent of the now-president of France's relationship with the controversial global firm that was operating in violation of French law has not been revealed until now.
A spokesperson for Mr Macron said in an email: ""His functions naturally led him to meet and interact with many companies engaged in the sharp shift which came out during those years in the service sector, which had to be facilitated by unlocking administrative and regulatory hurdles.""
Uber said the ""suspension of UberPop was in no way followed by more favourable regulations,"" and a new law that came into force in 2018 resulted in France adopting ""stricter regulations"" that were ""in no way beneficial to Uber"".
files also reveal how Uber's relationship with one of Europe's top officials, European Commission vice-president Neelie Kroes, began significantly earlier and ran deeper than previously was known, putting her in an apparent breach of rules governing commissioners' conduct.
reveal she was in talks to join Uber's advisory board before she even left her last European post in November 2014. 
EU rules say commissioners have to respect a ""cooling-off"" period, then 18 months, during which new jobs require the approval of the commission. 
As a commissioner, Ms Kroes oversaw digital and competition policy, and was a high-profile scourge of big tech, playing a leading role in hitting Microsoft and Intel with massive fines.
But of all the companies she could have worked for after leaving, Uber was a particularly controversial choice. 
In her home country, the Netherlands, the UberPop ridesharing service had also brought legal and political trouble.
Uber drivers were arrested in October 2014, and that December a judge in the Hague banned UberPop, threatening fines up to 100,000 euros. In March 2015, Uber's Amsterdam office was raided by Dutch police.
Emails say that Ms Kroes called ministers and other members of the government to persuade them to back down during the raid.During another raid a week later, Ms Kroes again contacted a Dutch minister the Uber Files show, and, in the words of an email, ""harassed"" the head of the Dutch civil service.
An internal email advised staff not to discuss her informal relationship externally: ""Her reputation and our ability to negotiate solutions in the Netherlands and elsewhere would suffer from any casual banter inside or outside the office.""
files show that the company wanted Ms Kroes to pass messages on to the office of the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte.
In October 2015, an email reads: ""We'll get backchannel going with Neelie and the PM's Chief of Staff, to extract maximum advantage through 'giving' them the notion of a 'victory'.""
She wrote to the commission's Ad Hoc Ethical Committee requesting permission to join Uber's advisory board before the 18 months were up, and appealed to commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. 
rmission was denied, but documents show Ms Kroes continued to help the company informally until her appointment was announced, shortly after the cooling-off period had ended.
underlines that Ms Kroes was in a ""clear breach"" of the rules, says Alberto Alemanno, Jean Monnet professor of European Union law at HEC Paris. 
""You're proving the fact that you're doing something you are not allowed to do,"" he told BBC Panorama. ""Because if she didn't necessarily ask for permission, you might still argue there was a grey area, there was a grey zone. But now it's no longer there.""
Looking at all the disclosures about Ms Kroes' relationship with Uber, he said: ""It makes me feel that our system is probably not fit for purpose because this situation should have been prevented.""
Ms Kroes denies that she had any ""formal or informal role at Uber"" before May 2016, when the cooling-off period expired.
She said as an EU commissioner she interacted with numerous technology companies, ""always driven by what I believe would benefit the public interest"".
During the cooling off period, the Dutch government appointed her special envoy for start-ups, which involved interactions with a ""wide array of business, government and non-governmental entities"" with the aim of promoting a ""business-friendly and welcoming ecosystem in the Netherlands"", she said.
A spokesperson for the Dutch ministry of economic affairs says that ""Uber was not considered a start-up in 2015"".
Uber says Ms Kroes left the advisory board in 2018, and says it has since introduced new guidelines ""strengthening oversight"" of ""lobbying and external engagements with policymakers"" in Europe.
If the police came knocking, Uber had a second line of defence - the ""kill switch"", which made it impossible for visiting law enforcement to access the company's computers.
would restrict officers' access to sensitive company data, such as lists of drivers, which the company believed would harm its growth.
files confirm earlier news reports about the kill switch, and reveal that Mr Kalanick himself activated the system at least once.
""Please hit the kill switch ASAP. Access must be shut down in AMS [Amsterdam],"" an email from his account says.
kill switch was also used in Canada, Belgium, India, Romania and Hungary, and at least three times in France.
Uber says it has had no ""'kill switch' designed to thwart regulatory inquiries anywhere in the world"" since the new chief executive took over in 2017.
A spokesperson for Mr Kalanick said he never authorised any actions or programmes that would obstruct justice in any country, and any accusation he did is completely false. He said Uber ""used tools that protect intellectual property and the privacy of their customers"" and that ""these fail-safe protocols do not delete any data or information, and were approved by Uber's legal and regulatory departments"".
Uber Files is a leak of 124,000 records including emails and texts exposing conversations and meetings between Uber executives and public officials as the technology-driven taxi firm sought to expand its business. The files were leaked to the Guardian which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and media partners in 29 countries, including the BBC's Panorama.

In an update on Tuesday she said treatment was ""back on the cards"" after evidence of the disease was recently found in her abdomen. As a result she will now undergo chemotherapy.
Despite the setback, Godley said she aimed to fulfil her 27-date Not Dead Yet tour in February and March.
It includes shows across Scotland, from Inverness to Galashiels, and concludes with three dates at the Leicester Square Theatre in London.
Godley said: ""I am determined to get back on stage.
""I have always been a kind of die on your feet no your knees type of person, you know me, so I'm looking forward to the tour.""
She then added: ""I think it is going to be fair and honest to say it might be the last time you'll see me live on stage.
""I am hoping it's no but I think it's a fair estimation that that will be what we are looking at.""
Godley explained her ovarian cancer was stage three and therefore treatable not curable.
rtainer also said she was being supported by the staff and specialists at The Beatson Cancer Centre in Glasgow.
She then turned back to her tour and said: ""I don't want to fade away. I want to go out with a bang. Are you ready to see me go out with a bang?
""I am not going sing My Way. It's no gonna be that kind of tour. There's going to be a lot of fun.""
Godley added that getting back on stage would be a ""dream come true"".
Stars including tennis legend Martina Navratilova and singer Curtis Stigers were among those who wished Godley well after her announcement.
In November last year the comedian confirmed she had been diagnosed after suffering from a bloated feeling in her stomach.
Godley, who found viral fame with her dubbed sketches about First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, urged anyone with symptoms to get them checked out.
Her pastiches of Ms Sturgeon's coronavirus news briefings gained her a massive social media following during the pandemic.
She featured in Scottish government coronavirus adverts but they were pulled after offensive historical tweets by her came to light."	/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-63964719
business	Cost of living: Bath trader's sleepless nights over Â£100k energy bill	"A business owner is enduring sleepless nights after being told her energy bills will rise to over Â£100,000.
Annette Dolan, who runs Bath Aqua Glass, currently pays Â£14,000 a year, but is facing the steep rise at the end of September when her contract ends.
She said it would mean the price of a vase made at her glassblowing studio in Bath rising from Â£45 to Â£350.
Some businesses are already facing price rises in excess of 200% as gas and electricity prices soar.
Ms Dolan said she was concerned for the future of her business.

But the increase has left Ms Dolan wondering how she is going to meet the costs.
""There's no way that we can actually operate at that level,"" she said.
""My bookkeeper and I are both having massive sleepless nights. We're both thinking, 'What are we going to do'?
""It's a nightmare. The brokers have been trying to get me to sign and I'm saying this is untenable, I cannot sign.""
Ms Dolan has worked in the glassblowing business for 26 years and says she will do all she can to keep the firm running.
""Whether I'm going to save this business or not only the future will tell me, but I will do my damndest for all my staff and myself,"" she added.
Energies, Ms Dolan's energy provider, said it offered a range of products to suit customer needs and advised customers to contact them if they are having difficulty paying.

technology	Google Translate used to talk to Ukrainian refugees - North Tyneside Council	"A council resorted to using Google Translate to communicate with Ukrainian refugees due to not enough interpreting services being available.
North Tyneside Council said it had a peak of Ukrainians fleeing Russian attacks arriving in April and May. 
While the authority had access to translation services, council officers said the facilities ""were just not enough"" to cope with the high demand.
Officers added they were using everything they could to provide help.
re are 258 Ukrainian refugees living in North Tyneside, with a further 37 expected to arrive in the next weeks, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Ian Rice, the authority's welfare and tenancy support manager, said: ""We do throughout the authority have access to interpreters and translation services. 
What we very quickly found was that whilst we do have access to those facilities, the numbers, particularly in April and May time, were just not enough.
""So, we used Google Translate.""
Council staff also used a translating service on Microsoft Word to email and correspond with Ukrainian guests, which officers acknowledged ""might not always be perfect"".
However, officers claimed no guests had yet complained and added it had helped open up dialogue. 
fficers added that professional translation services were sought for more complex circumstances.
In addition, several refugees had also stepped forward to help officers as interpreters.
""We have had a couple of our Ukrainian guests help us out and volunteer to translate and a number of our guests who are school teachers have helped,"" Mr Rice continued.
""We are using everything we possibly can to help and support them and quite a number of them speak quite good English,"" Mr Rice said.
He added that the government and the Red Cross had also provided translation materials in Russian and Ukrainian.

politics	Dominic Raab: Bullying investigation extended to include third complaint	"Addressing claims of bullying, the deputy PM says he has behaved in line with the ministerial code.
Rishi Sunak has asked for the investigation into alleged bullying by Dominic Raab to be expanded to include a third formal complaint.
Earlier this week, No 10 confirmed a lawyer would investigate two complaints about Mr Raab. 
Now it says a new claim relating to Mr Raab's behaviour as Brexit secretary in 2018 will also be examined.
Mr Raab, who is both the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, has denied any allegations of bullying. 
He has insisted he ""behaved professionally at all times"" and that he looks forward to dealing with the complaints ""transparently rather than dealing with anonymous comments in the media"". 
Mr Raab is a close ally of Mr Sunak and Downing Street has said he has the PM's full confidence.
But Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has called for a wider ""proactive investigation"" of Mr Raab's behaviour during his time as a minister, covering informal complaints as well as any concerns raised formally.
She described restricting the scope of the investigation to only formal complaints as a ""stitch-up"" that ""will fool no one"".
It comes after sources told the BBC the Ministry of Justice, where Mr Raab now works, has been ""inundated"" with complaints of alleged bullying.
Last week, Mr Raab asked Mr Sunak to launch an inquiry into his conduct after allegations about his behaviour towards staff.
government appointed lawyer Adam Tolley KC to ""establish the specific facts"" about two formal complaints that have been lodged about Mr Raab's conduct when he was foreign secretary and justice secretary, during Boris Johnson's premiership.
wyer will report to Mr Sunak, who will make the final judgement on whether Mr Raab's conduct breached the ministerial code. 
But the scope of the inquiry can be widened ""at the discretion of the prime minister, in consultation with the investigator,"" according to its terms of reference.
Mr Raab was sacked as justice secretary and deputy prime minister by former PM Liz Truss when she took power in September.
But the Esher and Walton MP was reappointed to both roles by Mr Sunak following his election as Conservative leader by the party's MPs.
re is now a coordinated effort by former private secretaries of Mr Raab to ensure their allegations are heard as part of the investigation.
Private secretaries work in the private office of government ministers on the day-to-day running of the department, including managing the minister's diary and advising on policy matters.
BBC has been told that a number of these civil servants across multiple departments are preparing to submit their formal complaints.
Of these complaints, some have already been submitted formally to government departments, while others are being readied. 
r a wide timescale, spanning from when Mr Raab was a junior minister to his time in cabinet, which he joined in July 2018 as Brexit secretary. 
Labour's deputy leader said: ""There must be no hint of a whitewash when it comes to the slew of serious allegations the deputy prime minister now faces.""
Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Wendy Chamberlain MP said: ""This flood of allegations about Dominic Raab's bullying behaviour cannot be swept under the carpet - Rishi Sunak must confirm he will sack Raab if these complaints are upheld.""
Downing Street said the latest formal complaint about Mr Raab was received on Wednesday and Mr Sunak asked for it to become part of the formal investigation on Thursday evening. 
Separately, BBC Newsnight has also been told that Mr Raab received multiple warnings from officials not to use his personal email account for government business.
Last month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman was forced to quit after sharing government documents using her private email.
However, Mr Raab has argued his use of private emails did not breach the rules, and that the ministerial code allows for it to be done in some circumstances. 
""I've always taken advice on the right means, particularly having been foreign secretary and dealing with a whole range of sensitive issues, I've always been very careful to protect the integrity of any communications I had,"" he said.
Asked if he had been warned by civil servants not to use his own phone for government business, he replied: ""No.""
A friend of the minister has told the BBC he used a private account on occasions for approving tweets and quotes related to government business.
Liberal Democrats said the Cabinet Office should ""determine immediately if overseas enemies could have seen national secrets sent by Dominic Raab"".
A Downing Street spokesman said: ""Ministers are able to use various forms of communication. As long as they take heed of that guidance, there is not a binary restriction on use of personal email addresses."""	/news/uk-politics-63754206
politics	Labour MP Ian Byrne reselected as Liverpool West Derby candidate	"An MP who had faced a battle to be chosen to represent Labour at the next election has been reselected as the party's candidate.
Ian Byrne, who has represented Liverpool West Derby since 2019, was announced as the winner of a ballot on Sunday. 
He had had to compete for the seat after losing a series of votes in local constituency branches.
Mr Byrne and the Labour Party have been approached for a comment by the BBC.
MP had faced competition from Liverpool councillor Anthony Lavelle and Lancashire councillor Kimberley Whitehead.
During the contest, he accused Mr Lavelle's supporters of ""intimidation"", a claim which was strongly denied by the councillor's backers.
Mr Byrne was first selected to replace the previous Labour MP Stephen Twigg in early 2019.
At the time, he was a local ward councillor in Everton and was a vocal supporter of then-party leader Jeremy Corbyn.
He is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group of backbench Labour MPs and is a familiar face on match days on Merseyside, collecting donations for the charity he set up, Fans Supporting Foodbanks.
In Parliament, he has campaigned for a right to food to be established in law and for the Hillsborough disaster to be added to the national curriculum.
Ian Byrne is part of the Socialist Campaign Group parliamentary caucus of Labour MPs - made up of MPs on the left of the Labour party. 
Some Labour left-wingers, including supporters of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn, have claimed in recent months they are being frozen out of standing for the party at the next general election as Sir Keir Starmer seeks to remake the party in his own image. 
But a Labour spokesperson previously said that the party's ""due diligence is about weeding out candidates who could cause electoral damage"".
However, the fact Mr Byrne was not automatically selected prompted criticism by Labour's left - including the group Momentum, who said that despite ""a deeply flawed trigger ballot process which broke with basic principles of fairness"", he had ""roared back to victory"".
""also struck a blow... against an out-of-control Starmer machine willing to break Labour's own rules, disregard trade unions and attack its own MPs in the service of their right-wing purge"".

business	Energy bills: 'We cut back but are paying three times as much'	"Amy Appleyard had been paying Â£136 a month to heat and light her home.
Knowing that energy bills would rise in the autumn, she and her family had cut back on how much power they were using.
But they were shocked to be told that their monthly direct debit would rise more than three times to Â£442.
re just one of many UK households who have cut back on energy but are still being charged higher direct debits. But suppliers say bills have to reflect soaring energy prices.
It comes after Business Secretary Grant Shapps wrote to energy firms asking them to ensure bills reflected the amount of energy customers were using, and not to over-estimate charges. 
Mrs Appleyard, her husband Mike and eight-year-old daughter Kathryn, faced the huge hike in direct debit energy payments despite cutting back at their three-bedroom home in Greater Manchester.
""We've all become a bit more obsessive about turning off lights or unplugging chargers,"" Mrs Appleyard said.
""We also didn't put the heating on as early as usual this year, just maybe for an hour to warm the house through.""
She said her family's ""nightmare"" started because her supplier cut their monthly direct debit without telling them, so when it made its annual review of their monthly payments it led to a much bigger increase than usual.
""After spending hours on the phone, and being guaranteed that I would pay Â£200 monthly, and then seeing that Â£442 was still taking out of my account, I just burst into tears,"" she said.
Since then there have been more conversations and Mrs Appleyard said she hoped the situation will soon be sorted.
""We just want to pay for the gas and electricity we used but it's become very difficult,"" she said.
""I've been told that only Â£200 will be taken out of my account in December, but the situation is ongoing and has been horribly stressful.""
Meanwhile, Rory in South Wales said his direct debits had also gone up, while his energy use had gone down, so he ended up Â£1,400 in credit with his supplier.
He told Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show that he had asked to reduce his direct debit to a monthly amount he could afford but his supplier refused.
He said the direct debits have been increased to Â£481 even though his monthly usage has been nearer Â£300.
""I simply want to reduce it to an amount I can afford to pay and use the surplus to top up. I don't want to have all that money sitting there and me paying a ridiculous amount to the energy provider,"" he said.
Customers who pay gas and electricity bills by direct debit have the costs evened out over the year in a process known as smoothing.
m of smoothing is to avoid sudden bill shocks by spreading the cost over the whole year so even if you use a lot more energy in a winter month, you don't get a nasty surprise.
u get should be the actual amount you're charged for your energy. It is a combination of a standing daily charge plus your metered energy usage (your unit rate per kWh). 
It will change every month, depending on how much energy you use.
Suppliers encourage direct debit payments by offering customers a discount. They then estimate what your bills will be over the year, based on the price of gas and electricity and on your previous and predicted energy use.
Suppliers should ensure your direct debit payment is fair and proportionate to your usage.
If any customer ends up overpaying, they should be able to claim the extra amount back at the end of the year and maybe reduce their direct debits.
However rising energy costs - prices have doubled since last year - have left most people facing higher direct debits.
If your direct debit payments are regularly higher than your bills, you can challenge the amount with your supplier. 
Ask them to lower your monthly payments to reflect more accurately the amount of energy you actually use, based on your meter readings.
If they refuse you can make a complaint to your supplier and if you get no satisfaction you can escalate it to the Energy Ombudsman. 
Earlier this year, an Ofgem review of how energy firms were charging customers by direct debit revealed that about 500,000 households had seen their payments double, despite prices rising by 54%.
It told UK energy suppliers to review the way they charge customers by direct debit.
Ofgem said it had already called on firms to address the issue, but would be prepared to take further action if necessary.
At the weekend Mr Shapps told energy firms: ""I am interested to understand how you intend to ensure that your direct debit system does not over-estimate charging.""
Energy UK, the industry trade body, has said rising direct debits were inevitable as bills had to reflect the doubling in energy prices since last year.
Household energy costs are set to rise again next year which will mean further rises in direct debits.
government's energy price guarantee is being scaled back from April, when a typical household's annual bill will increase to Â£3,000."	/news/business-63785431
politics	Flawed EU settlement scheme could create illegal migrants says High Court	"UK scheme to settle millions of EU citizens risks creating illegal migrants overnight and is unlawful, the High Court has ruled. 
In a highly critical judgment, the court said the scheme breached the UK's Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
watchdog for EU citizens' rights argued the scheme could strip people of rights if they don't register in time. 
Home Office said EU citizens are friends with clear protections and it will challenge the ruling. 
Since 2018, the Home Office has run a two-stage process for EU citizens who wanted to remain in the UK. 
me was set up because the EU's freedom of movement principle had meant many people from within the bloc had never needed permission to be in the UK under immigration laws that apply to other parts of the world. 
Under the scheme, at least 2.2 million people currently have ""pre-settled status"". This is a limited right to live and work in the UK and expires if they don't re-apply for full settled status after five years. 
Some 200,000 people, who were part of the scheme's pilot in 2018, must register for full settled status by August 2023 - or they could lose their legal rights. 
Independent Monitoring Authority (IMA), the post-Brexit watchdog for EU citizens' rights, challenged these arrangements in the High Court, saying ministers were breaking the legal promises they had given to the European Union.
It argued huge numbers of people could become illegal immigrants overnight if they didn't apply for the second stage on time. 
would mean they would lose their right to live, work or study and their access to health services. 
risk of that happening, its lawyers argued, had never been intended in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. 
, the High Court agreed, ruling the scheme created so much uncertainty it breached the UK's deal with the EU. 
Mr Justice Lane said a very large number of people could face serious uncertainty. 
""The consequence... of limited leave coming to an end, without being followed by further leave, is extremely serious,"" said the judge.
""The person concerned becomes an overstayer, who from that point is in the United Kingdom unlawfully. 
""A person who knowingly remains beyond the time limited by the leave commits a criminal offence. In my judgment, these consequences cannot be brushed aside as merely procedural matters.""
judge said that people who had not secured their full settled status would be at the mercy of the Home Office's decision-making. 
""Someone who makes a belated application for further leave [to remain] will not know whether the defendant will accept the late application,"" he said.
Dr Kathryn Chamberlain, the head of IMA, said the watchdog had asked the court to give people clarity before the first tranche of EU citizens approach the August 2023 deadline. 
""I am pleased that the judge has recognised the significant impact this issue could have had on the lives and livelihoods of citizens with pre-settled status in the UK,"" she said. 
But junior Home Office minister Lord Murray said the government was disappointed and planned to appeal. 
""EU citizens are our friends and neighbours, and we take our obligations to securing their rights in the UK very seriously,"" he said. 
""The EU Settlement Scheme goes above and beyond our obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement, protecting EU citizens' rights and giving them a route to settlement in the UK."""	/news/uk-64053696

Additional revelations could include source code, assets, and testing builds from both GTA 5 and GTA 6, which could be damaging to the company's operations. 
While the original post has since been removed by moderators, it has been spread widely on social media. Rockstar has reportedly issued takedown orders to remove the footage from YouTube and Twitter. 
footage showed animation tests, level layouts and some gameplay demonstrations, and it appeared to confirm a long-running rumour that the game will feature the series' first playable female protagonist.

A man left with serious injuries after trying to take his life has said a music therapist helped give him a reason to live again.
m, 55, from Cardiff suffered brain injuries in 2020.
He is now partially sighted, his left arm was amputated just below his shoulder and he is now a full time wheelchair user.
While in a rehabilitation unit he was introduced to a music therapist and his life changed.
m said he was nervous about working with Lucie Phillips, from the music therapy charity Nordoff Robbins, but soon rediscovered his love of music.
""I didn't know what to think, but once I'd tried it out - and Lucie was so good with me, it was easy,"" he said.
""I was buzzing. Every week I'd be thinking, come on Wednesday, come on Wednesday, because I couldn't wait to do it again.
""It has brought a bit of joy, yeah because losing my arm, being a guitar player was horrendous, it's horrendous to be honest with you, I don't know how to describe it, but we move on we live on.""
Covid restrictions meant the two could not meet in person so they worked online to create music.
""It took a few weeks to write, little by little, but it was really good, Lucie was really patient with me,"" he added.

He sings and uses a computer.
racks were recorded at the Shabbey Road recording studio in Caerphilly.
""There's no better feeling than creating music you know. I realised how much I missed it,"" said Tim.
Lucie remembers the first time she connected with Tim online.
""He was in a really difficult place when I first met him,"" she said.
""He was on a neuro rehabilitation ward and he'd been referred onto music therapy.
""He was feeling pretty low and they knew that he was a musician and wondered if music therapy might be able to help.
""As music therapists we're there to bring the wonders of music to people who aren't able to access music and use it for themselves when they're going through particular traumas in their lives.""
Lucie said Tim has  ""an amazingly eclectic taste in music"".
""We got to know each other through the songs Tim knows and loves from Roy Orbison, The Beatles, Black Sabbath and many more and many songs,"" she said.
""Then eventually we got onto song writing.
""We were using Zoom and were having to be incredibly patient with each other.
""Both being musicians we knew how frustrating it was not to be able to make music exactly at the same time. It's not easy, so hats off to Tim for persevering.""
week was the first time Tim and Lucie had met in person.
Lucie said Tim is very different to the man she first talked to in the rehabilitation unit.
""I think Tim is a more confident Tim now,"" she said. 
""I think Tim has processed what has happened to him and I think he has perhaps made some peace with that.
""It has been quite a nerve wracking journey meeting up and rehearsing and then recordingâ¦ especially after not working together for such a long time, but Tim has absolutely risen to the challenge."""	/news/uk-wales-63487468

He has been suspended as a Conservative MP since announcing he was off to Australia. One Tory colleague described him as an ""absolute prat"" and he has faced calls from opposition politicians to give up his MP's salary, Â£84,144 a year.
He was appointed health secretary in 2018, before overseeing pandemic restrictions including lockdowns and social distancing.
footage, which showed him breaking his own social distancing rules with his political aide and university friend Gina Coladangelo, was leaked to the Sun. 
Dominic Cummings, who was Boris Johnson's closest advisor, claimed Mr Hancock had lied about Covid testing hospital patients before they were released into care homes. This was firmly denied by Mr Hancock. Mr Cummings also published expletive-laden messages about a different issue, purportedly from Boris Johnson, in which the PM calls the health secretary ""hopeless"".
Born and raised in Cheshire, he studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University and then economics at Cambridge. Before becoming MP for West Suffolk he worked for his family's computer software business and as an economist for the Bank of England. He has three children.

health	Midwives in Scotland reject latest NHS pay offer	"Members of the union representing midwives in Scotland have rejected the latest NHS pay offer. 
Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said 65% of members voted against it. The union will now consider next steps including possible industrial action. 
NHS offered an average pay increase of 7.5%. It was accepted by Unison and Unite members but rejected by the GMB.
Scottish government has said the proposal was unprecedented at a time of ""extraordinary financial challenges"".
Royal College of Nursing has also rejected the pay offer and said it would soon announce dates for strikes. 
Jaki Lambert, RCM director for Scotland, said: ""Our members have spoken loud and clear - the latest pay offer by the Scottish government is simply not good enough. It goes nowhere near addressing the rising cost of living and would see many midwives actually worse off in real terms.
""Our members have been consistent throughout this process - they want a decent deal, and they are prepared to take industrial action to get one. 
""No midwife wants to do this and it is for the Scottish government to make sure that they do not feel that they are left with no other option. 
""While we acknowledge that the Scottish government has listened to some of the concerns regarding career opportunities and development, it has failed to meet our members' needs on pay.""
Last month, Holyrood ministers tabled an improved pay offer averaging 7.5% to health workers threatening industrial action.
Annual salary rises under the proposal would range from a flat rate payment of Â£2,205 for staff in Bands 1 to 4 and up to Â£2,660 for staff in Bands 5 to 7, backdated to April. 
represents an increase of 11.3% for the lowest paid workers and delivers an average uplift of 7.5%.
Unite and Unison chose to accept the deal, however, the GMB union became the first to reject it last week.
Scottish government said previously that the pay offer was unprecedented for front-line employees and would ensure NHS workers in Scotland remain the best paid in the UK.
RCM is part of the Scottish Terms and Conditions Committee (STAC), which negotiates pay deals with the Scottish government. STAC staff will meet with ministers on Thursday to share the outcomes of their respective consultations, the RCM said. "	/news/uk-scotland-64050826

Ms Victory, who is also an author, said she felt privileged returning to Northwick Park Hospital in London to give a talk with him for trainee staff.
""It was an honour to talk with Dr Viv about the good and the bad from my 98-day stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to give advice on things that could be improved upon from a patient perspective,"" she said.
""Dr Viv said my heart stopped beating whilst I was laying on my front, which is literally a worst-case scenario, but he and a team of 10 nurses and doctors brought me back to life. And because of them I am here. Alive, breathing, living, thriving.""
Dr Sathianathan, clinical lead for intensive care medicine, said: ""We are all extremely pleased that Grace has made such an impressive recovery.
""We always strive to learn and improve and it was really informative to hear Grace talk to the team about the good and the bad during her time with us.""
Ms Victory, who was in a coma for three months, said the pair also spoke about the need for better psychological support for ICU patients and staff traumatised by the pandemic. She hopes to work on this idea with the charity Mind, for which she is an ambassador.
When the vlogger woke up in March 2021, she was finally able to meet her 10-week-old son Cyprus Sevyn for the first time. 
He was born by emergency C-section on Christmas Eve 2020, when Ms Victory was seven months pregnant, because she was so sick with coronavirus. 
Doctors have been amazed by her recovery, she said, after they initially only gave her a 5% chance of survival.
Ms Victory is now pregnant with her second child, a little girl, and is due to give birth next month.
""I'm now focusing on birth prep, relaxation and spending time with my bestie Cyprus Sevyn. I feel as if a chapter is closing and a new one is beginning and I could not be more excited,"" she added.

entertainment	Worcester Scala Theatre plan goes ahead despite spiralling costs	"A multimillion-pound art centre development will be built despite concerns about spiralling costs and a likely budget shortfall.
Several parts of the project for Scala Theatre in Worcester have been dropped to enable the development to go ahead.
uncil is waiting to hear if it could divert Â£6m of Â£18m in funding away from other projects.
It has decided to push on with the project and accept the cost  will not be known until it is built.
It had considered abandoning the scheme due to ""significant"" costs.
urrent budget, which has risen because of the rising cost of construction and materials, is already millions of pounds short and the council is still trying to hunt down potential investors to bridge the gap, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
A 110-seat studio theatre has been removed from the development amid the budget problems and the council has had to redraw plans for the new 500-seat venue in Angel Place. 
resources committee gave the green light for the council to submit a revised planning application and continue the desperate search for much-needed funds at a meeting on 13 December.
uncil said it ""expects"" the government to back its request to divert funding, but admits it would still leave the project Â£500,000 - or as much as Â£850,000 - short.
It was given just over Â£6.5m by the government to carry out the Scala and smaller Corn Exchange work - with the council contributing an extra Â£725,000 towards the project.
But plans to sell the Swan Theatre, to contribute to the funds, have been scrapped which means the gap could grow to Â£850,000.
Managing director David Blake said the council had ""thought long and hard"" and maintained the best option was to move ahead with the work.
""It does mean that until the building is finished, it's difficult to know exactly what it will cost but it does mean that the council will be in control of those costs and be able to decide what elements it may or may not decide to take forward if the costs exceed the budget,"" he said.

health	Fresh nurse strike dates announced in England	"Nurses will go on strike again on 18 and 19 January in England unless pay talks are opened, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has said.
Nurses at more hospital trusts than before will be involved in the strike action in the new year, the union said.
Meanwhile, the GMB union has called off a second day of ambulance strikes planned in England and Wales for 28 December.
But it announced a new co-ordinated walkout on 11 January. 
wo days of nurses strikes were held in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 15 and 20 December, which resulted in more than 40,000 patient appointments and procedures being rescheduled.
On two consecutive days in January, there will be 12-hour walkouts by nurses at 55 health trusts in England - around a quarter.
Pat Cullen, head of the RCN, said the union had been left ""with no choice"" but to arrange January strikes.
""The government had the opportunity to end this dispute before Christmas but instead they have chosen to push nursing staff out into the cold again in January,"" Ms Cullen said. 
""The public support has been heart-warming and I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do for patients and the future of the NHS.""
Health Secretary Steve Barclay said he was ""disappointed"" by the decision to take further strike action. He said meeting unions' pay demands would mean money being taken away from frontline services, causing delays to patients' treatment.
""Strikes are in no one's best interest, least of all patients, and I urge unions to reconsider further strike action before walkouts have a worse impact on patients,"" he added. 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was ""really sad"" about the disruption being caused ""to so, so many people's lives, particularly at Christmas time.""
But he insisted he had ""acted fairly and reasonably"" in accepting public sector pay recommendations and could not risk inflation rising any further.

In Scotland, NHS workers are to be awarded an average pay increase of 7.5% - but nurses are still expected to announce strike dates in the new year. They rejected the pay deal, alongside midwives and staff belonging to the GMB union.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the deal was ""the biggest since devolution"" and he had no more money for pay this year - but he said he was prepared to meet unions during the festive period to stop further strike action.
Royal College of Midwives says its members in Scotland may also take action in 2023.
Up to 10,000 ambulance members were expected to walk out on Wednesday 28 December. 
union said it was scrapping the action next week so that ""the public will be able to enjoy Christmas without additional anxiety"".
f strike action on 11 January means GMB workers will again be striking on the same day as ambulance workers represented by Unison. 
It means thousands of paramedics, call handlers and technicians will walk out in nine of England's 10 trusts, and across Wales in the new year.
Unison said yesterday it planned two more days of strikes on 11 and 23 January in London, Yorkshire, the North West, North East and South West.
unions say they want the government to come to the table and negotiate pay in order to help retain staff and improve patient care.
Rachel Harrison, GMB National Secretary, said they were suspending action on 28 December because they had been overwhelmed by ""amazing public support"".
But she said the new January strike date showed the union's commitment to getting higher pay for ambulance staff was ""stronger than ever"".
""The government can now do what ambulance workers and the public want - get round the table and talk pay now. We are here 24/7. Any time, any place,"" she said.  
A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We will continue to work to bring together trade unions, employers and government to deliver the best possible outcomes for workers, while continuing to call on the UK government to use the funding it has to provide a fair pay offer to NHS staff and enable us to do the same in Wales.""

business	Octopus Energy to take over collapsed supplier Bulb	"Octopus boss Greg Jackson says the company expects a ""seamless"" switch for Bulb customers
Energy supplier Octopus Energy is to buy its smaller competitor Bulb.
Bulb collapsed last year amid rising gas and electricity prices and has since been run by the government.
Its 1.5 million customers will not see any change or disruption to energy supplies, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said.
ue of the deal has not been published but the BBC understands Octopus paid the government between Â£100m and Â£200m.
It is expected to be completed by the end of November.
Business Secretary Grant Shapps said the deal, approved by the UK government, would bring ""vital reassurance and energy security to consumers across the country at a time when they need it most"". 
government announcement on Saturday made no mention of the money involved in the deal, which was reached overnight between special administrators of Bulb and Octopus Energy.
ment said that ""due to high market volatility it is impossible"" to forecast the true cost of Bulb. 
For Bulb customers, credit balances on bills will be protected and direct debits automatically transferred.
Greg Jackson, Octopus Energy Group boss, said the company was determined to provide a ""stable home for the future"" for Bulb's customers and staff. Bulb has 650 employees.
Mr Jackson told the BBC he was confident the takeover would be smooth, saying the company had ""a great track record"" when it came to moving customers across companies. 
firm has agreed to share profits - if any are made from its new Bulb customers - with the government, for up to four years. 
Octopus said the move would bring ""an end to taxpayer losses"", adding it was ""paying the government"" to take on Bulb's customers. 
It was previously reported in July that Octopus had requested Â£1bn in public funding for the deal. However a source close to the company has since categorically denied this. 
London-based Bulb was the biggest of more than 30 energy companies that collapsed last November following a spike in wholesale gas prices, which was partly caused by Covid restrictions ending and has since been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. 
It was placed into ""special administration"", meaning it was run by the government through the regulator Ofgem. The special administration measure is only used if Ofgem is unable to find another company to take over an energy firm's customers. 
ut of Bulb had been forecast to cost the taxpayer around Â£2bn by next year. It was the biggest state bailout since the Royal Bank of Scotland collapse during the 2008 financial crisis.
Natural gas prices have doubled since last October, and despite dropping significantly from a peak in August, many families are struggling to get by as they also grapple with rising inflation, which reached 10.1% in September.  
As part of the mini-budget announced by former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng in September, the government announced an ""energy price guarantee"" - capping typical household bills at Â£2,500 - for two years, but Jeremy Hunt - who replaced Mr Kwarteng as chancellor earlier this month - then said the support will last until April. 
Mr Hunt is expected to make a full statement on his spending plans on 17 November. 
Every household in the UK is also getting an energy bill discount of Â£400 this October.
Mr Shapps, who became business secretary this week, said the deal highlighted the government's ""overriding priority"" to protect customers. He added he would do everything he could to ""ensure our energy system provides secure and affordable energy for all"". 
Octopus will continue to use Bulb's technology and branding ""for a transitionary period"", the government's statement said.
mpany, which was founded in the UK in 2015, said that before the Bulb acquisition it served 3.4 million customers.

business	Japanese yen touches 32-year low against US dollar	"Japanese yen touched a 32-year low against the US dollar after official figures showed that prices had risen faster than expected in America.
fell to 147.66 against the US dollar before regaining some ground.
Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government will take ""appropriate action"" against the currency's volatility.
In a rare move last month, Japan spent almost $20bn (Â£17.6bn) to prop up the country's struggling currency.
""We cannot tolerate excessive volatility in the currency market driven by speculative moves. We're watching currency moves with a strong sense of urgency,"" Mr Suzuki told reporters after attending a G7 finance meeting in Washington, DC.
Last month, Japan intervened in the global currency market to help support the weakening yen.
move came after the yen hit a fresh 24-year low against the dollar, marking the first time that Japanese authorities had intervened in the currency market since 1998.
However, analysts have warned that interventions like this would have little effect as long as Japan's interest rates remain far lower than those in the US.
Japanese currency has come under increasing pressure in recent months, mainly due to the very different approach taken by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in comparison with the US Federal Reserve.
On Thursday, official figures showed that consumer prices in the US rose more than expected last month in a sign that the inflation fight in the world's largest economy is far from over.
Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, was 8.2% in the 12 months to September, down from 8.3% in August.
Rising consumer prices in the US are being closely watched as the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool inflation push up the value of the dollar as well as global borrowing costs.
America's central bank has been aggressively raising its interest rates to combat soaring prices, which has made the dollar more attractive to investors. In contrast, the BOJ kept rates very low.
r's strength on the global financial markets is also having an impact on other major currencies around the world, including the pound and the euro.

business	City fears Kwarteng's tax cuts may be anti-growth	"City insiders have warned that tax cuts designed to stimulate economic growth might have the opposite effect.
Bankers, bond traders and economists the BBC talked to cast doubt on the government policy that was announced on Friday.
Chancellor and Prime Minister's guiding star has been that if you put more money in the pockets of consumers and companies the economy should grow.
x cuts should therefore produce stronger economic growth.
However, the opposite might be true in this case, with the tax cuts making economic growth harder to achieve, the City of London insiders said.
unexpectedly large Â£45bn cut to existing and proposed tax rates has put even more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates faster than was previously contemplated.
Markets were expecting baseline interest rates set by the Bank to rise from 2.25% now to 4% next year. Since Friday's not-so-mini-budget, the bank rate is now expected to hit nearly 6% in May of next year.  
Companies don't get to borrow at that rate, they pay extra on top, for the perceived risk they won't be able to pay it back.
For example, Marks and Spencer would have to pay 10% or more if it was to borrow for 5 years in the market today.  
Very few companies are going to borrow to invest in their business - build a factory, hire more people, expand research and development - at rates that high.  
In fact, they are likely to try and reduce the debt they already have by not renewing loans as they come to the end of their term - reducing their spending and investment power. 
As one bond trader put it: ""The additional risk now associated with the UK specifically means UK companies will be charged an extra premium for their borrowing compared to last week, which runs counter to the government's growth agenda."" 
It may be that the markets will settle down, take a closer look at the government's other reforms and cuts to regulation promised in the coming weeks and months, and decide the government's plan for growth can work. 
But, as things stand, the UK and the companies that call it home have lost some credibility in the eyes of lenders.
reases borrowing costs by a margin that more than offsets the potential boost to the incomes of consumers and businesses of cuts to current income and proposed corporation tax rates.  
""Two steps forward - three steps back"" said another bond expert. No wonder they are sometime called bond vigilantes.

politics	Brexit: French tourism slump after leaving EU, Brittany Ferries says	"umber of people arriving at a UK port from France has more than halved after Brexit, a ferry firm has said.
Portsmouth ferry port saw 338,000 arrivals in 2019 but only 155,000 in 2022, according to Brittany Ferries.
firm said ""Brexit-related friction"" including a need for passports was a major factor, although sailings to and from Ireland, within the European Union, had seen increased business.
Home Office said the UK's entry rules were relatively generous.
Brittany Ferries said the vast majority of lost visitors were French holidaymakers, including student groups.
Spokesman Nigel Wonnacott said: ""We used to have loads of coaches parking outside with happy schoolchildren enjoying Portsmouth, going up to London and we really don't see much of that any more.
""Post-Brexit, French travellers are required to travel [to the UK] with a passport so it's expensive for them to get a passport because it's about 90 euros (Â£78), and it's also a big administrative burden.
""For Portsmouth, for the surroundings, for UK plc it's the loss of a significant number of potential travellers and all the richness that they bring economically and culturally.""
Previously the Tourism Alliance, which represents the British tourism industry, estimated a Â£875m loss to the UK economy from lost student groups in 2022.
Brittany Ferries said many French visitors had switched to its sailings to Ireland.
Last year saw a 30% increase in passengers travelling on its routes between Ireland, and both France and Spain, compared to 2019, the firm said.
Brittany Ferries operates services from France to Rosslare in Ireland and to Plymouth, Poole and Portsmouth in England.
A Home Office spokesman said the UK's rules were ""among the most generous in the world"".
kesman said visitors from France and other affected countries were told almost a year in advance of the requirement to use a passport from October 2021.

technology	Kate Bush: The Lambeg that gave Running Up That Hill its thunder	"Singer Kate Bush ordered a Lambeg drum from a shop in Belfast
One of Northern Ireland's most mysterious musical stories has been given new life by the resurgence of one of the most famous pop songs of the 80s.
On one side - Kate Bush, the enigmatic singer-songwriter, and Running Up That Hill, which has hit number one in the UK charts a full 37 years after its original release. 
Back then, the song went to number three in the charts but thanks to prominent usage in Netflix's horror smash Stranger Things, it will become Bush's second number one of her career, a mere 44 years after Wuthering Heights.
On the other side, the Lambeg drum - Northern Ireland's most iconic musical instrument, a seriously loud and huge piece of kit with a booming sound made famous by street parades.
Unlikely musical bedfellows perhaps - but no better way to ring out Running Up That Hill's ""thunder in our hearts"" than with the thunderous timbre of the Lambeg.
Kate Bush, one of the biggest pop stars in the world at the time, seemed to think so. 
Which is why William Hewitt, a drum maker on Sandy Row in Belfast, found himself with a strange request back in the early 1980s - and why the singer ended up with a bespoke drum, adorned with white fluffy clouds and apparently dubbed The Cloudbuster.
Elizabeth McKinley, William's daughter, told BBC News NI all about how her father - who ""wasn't really an excitable man at the best of times"" - came home to tell her the star had come into his Drum Sounds shop.
""She'd come into the shop with two young boys and apparently they were members of the band and someone had put her in the direction of my father as the drum maker - and he said 'you'll never guess who she was?', and he told us it was Kate Bush. He was very happy about it.
""He knew of her music, that would've been all - never would've dreamt he would've met her.""
ry of Kate Bush and the Lambeg has taken on mythical status in Northern Ireland music circles.
Bush, famously reclusive, hasn't released any new music in 11 years, almost never gives interviews and rarely plays gigs - her first run of concerts since 1979 came eight years ago.
Her music has occasionally returned to prominence in the years since her heyday in the 80s and early 90s - for instance, when The Futureheads yodelled-up cover of Hounds of Love turned into an indie hit in 2004.
But for the most part, Bush and her music remains an enigma - and likewise, so does The Cloudbuster. She has never spoken about it and its status is unknown. Meanwhile, William Hewitt, its maker, has since died. 
However, Northern Ireland music journalist Stuart Bailie and former musician Mike Edgar took up the story in an online video posted in 2020.
In it, Edgar - a member of Cruella De Ville, a Belfast-based band signed to record label giants EMI in the 1980s - recalled how his A&R man John Bagnall, who also represented Kate Bush, asked him if he could source a Lambeg for her. She had seen one on TV and wanted to know if she could get her own.
Perhaps it shouldn't have been that surprising that Kate Bush would look to this side of the Irish Sea for musical inspiration.
Her mother, Hannah Daly, was from Waterford in the Republic of Ireland and an Irish dancer. The album Hounds of Love would go to feature a track called Jig of Life, which included an extended coda of traditional Irish music. 
Renowned traditional Irish musicians DÃ³nal Lunny, John Sheahan and Liam O'Flynn played on the record. 
Despite famously composing much of Hounds of Love on a synthesizer - the Fairlight CMI - she melded those electronic sounds with acoustic folk instruments, such as balalaikas, bouzoukis and didgeridoos. And, of course, the Lambeg. 
According to Edgar, it was he who put the initial calls in to William Hewitt to arrange the drum to be made. He also recalled how it came to be painted with clouds.
Lambegs are traditionally associated with parades across Northern Ireland, with drummers beating out marching tunes. Usually they are painted with images associated with the Orange Order. But Kate Bush's request was a little out of the ordinary.  
""She had a particular picture she wanted on it,"" said Elizabeth McKinley. ""And father was used to doing the like of King Billy (King William of Orange) or orange lillies. But he had done banners so was quite a good painter, he was able to do the clouds and the picture from what she described she wanted.""
Elizabeth said it was Bush herself who came to get the drum and that she later wrote to thank her father.
""It's just a lovely thank you letter and it was handwritten and signed 'Kate Bush' - I have it somewhere. Somewhere among memorabiliaâ¦""
She also said Bush sent her father a video clip of the drum being used when recording the album.
rum, said Elizabeth, would have cost Â£300 or Â£350 in those days but now, even without being used by a beloved pop star, a brand new Lambeg would fetch about Â£4,000.
made drums - about 40 or 50 that William Hewitt would have made during his career - are still around, said Elizabeth. ""They're all out there somewhere, a lot of Lambeg men in the country have bought them and collected them over the years.""
She added: ""I was very proud of him. Proud of the banners every Twelfth, to stand and watch those banners come down - and certain drums would have my father's stamp on them and I would've known there's my father's (drum) heads. My father put the heads on that drum.""
rums are William Hewitt's legacy. And, now, so is the UK's number one single, finally at the top of the charts almost four decades after he tightened the drumheads on what would come to be known as The Cloudbuster.
Now, when Elizabeth hears the song and tells this story she thinks of him. She added: ""I think about him all the time."" "	/news/uk-northern-ireland-61844728

After winning the Arkle the previous day, Edwardstone has had a frustrating season, missing intended engagements in both the Shloer Chase at Cheltenham in November and in handicap company at Ascot the following weekend because of unsuitably quick ground.

politics	Delay to free school meal extension 'shameful', EIS union says	"rollout of free school meals to all primary pupils has been branded ""shameful"" by the country's biggest teaching union. 
general secretary of the EIS union, Andrea Bradley, said it ""runs contrary"" to efforts to tackle child poverty.
She also accused the Scottish government of attempting to ""obscure"" the move in its recent budget.
Ministers said Scotland had the ""most generous universal provision"" of free school lunches in the UK.
Scottish government had previously promised to introduce free school meals for all primary school pupils by August 2022.
So far this has only been delivered for youngsters in P1 to P5. 
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in September that the government would ""start work with local authorities to extend universal provision to all pupils in primary 6 and 7"".
But the EIS said details in the Scottish budget showed that the universal rollout of free school meals for P6 and P7 will now be delayed until 2024.
Ms Bradley said: ""Delaying the rollout of free school meals to all primary school children was a shameful decision, which runs contrary to the Scottish government's stated commitment to tackling child poverty.""
She added: ""This is now the second time that the rollout of this hugely important policy has been delayed, with serious consequences for thousands of children and families across Scotland.
""It is also extremely disappointing how this change in policy came to light - not announced in parliament, but obscured within the detail of the budget document itself.
""In a country where more than one child in four lives in poverty, and with the cost-of-living crisis pushing ever more families into financial difficulty, it is more important than ever that universal free school meals should be a priority.""
union chief said that while a ""watered-down, means-tested policy"" on free school meals is being introduced for youngsters in the final two years of primary school, many children could still miss out amid a cost of living crisis. 
She continued: ""Universal free meals remain the best way to ensure that all young people have access to a healthy and nutritious meal at school, without any stigma being attached.""
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said Scotland leads the way in the UK on free school meals. 
""All pupils in Primaries 1 to 5, children in funded early learning and childcare, and eligible pupils in Primary 6 through to S6 benefit from free meals in Scotland - the most generous universal provision of anywhere in the UK,"" she said.
""We will go further. Our additional investment announced in the 2023-24 Budget will continue to fund the expansion of free school meals for all Primary 6 and 7 pupils in receipt of the Scottish Child Payment, helping children most in need first.
""This will be the next step in fulfilling our commitment to universal provision in primary schools.""
Ms Somerville added: ""A number of local authorities have indicated that they face challenges in planning for the substantial expansion of free school meals. It is right that we work in partnership with local government to deliver our shared commitment."" "	/news/uk-scotland-64095765
politics	Wales' education: Teacher pressure sparks staffing fears	"Increasing pressure on teachers could lead to a ""crisis"" in staffing, a teaching union has said.
One head teacher said experienced staff had already quit the profession over long hours, among other issues.
National Headteachers Union Cymru said below-inflation pay awards were compounding the problem.
Education Minister Jeremy Miles told Wales Live he did not ""have the resources"" to increase pay beyond the 5% rise offered in July.
Louise Jones, head teacher at Maes y Morfa Primary Community School in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, said she regularly spoke to colleagues about concerns over the retention of experienced teaching staff.
She said they were concerned about the demands of the new curriculum, speaking Welsh, having the right digital skills and a new code of practice.
""The teachers that are leaving are the best teachers because they've done it for so long,"" she said.
""The salary doesn't compensate them for what they do and the hours are long.
Ms Jones added that teachers were not just learning supporters, but responsible for supporting with health, supporting with counselling and wellbeing, as well as also being obliged to support with healthcare, nursing and brushing teeth.
""Everything that used to be done by other professionals is now being pushed into the direction of teaching.
""We've lost teachers, not necessarily in this school, but in a school a stone's throw away.""
She said prior to Covid she would have had 27 applications for a learning support assistant role and the most recent recruiting round, this has dropped to five.
Laura Doel, head of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, said that while recruitment and retention had been an issue in Wales for a while, below-inflation pay awards were compounding it.
""We know from speaking to our own members that below-inflation pay awards continue to compound the recruitment crisis.""
Ms Doel said that, anecdotally, they had also heard that teachers were not staying in the profession after training. 
Gareth Evans, the director of education policy at University of Wales Trinity St Davids, said teacher retention and recruitment is an issue across Wales, and in fact the UK.
Speaking with BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Evans said he believes there is a looming crisis, if not one already.
""Education isn't immune from challenges facing the rest of the public sectors; shrinking budgets, scarcity of resources, fewer staff, the cost of living crisis, pay awards well below inflation, throw in legitimate work flow concerns related to the new curriculum and I think a hangover from Covid with it, and I do think we have something of a challenging situation on our hands.
""It's perhaps little wonder that teachers are in some cases reconsidering their positions and those seeking to become teachers are potentially looking for other jobs, but I don't think it's all doom and gloom by a long stretch and we must remember the positives.""
Mr Evans said the positives included competitive starting salaries, strong career development opportunities and having the power to change a child's life for the better.
""I think really what we need to do in Wales is change the narrative.
""The Welsh government, trade unions, and even teachers themselves on occasion are all guilty of perhaps selling a more negative picture of the profession when I think we could all do a slightly better job of selling the positives.""
Cameron Stewart leads on recruitment and retention for teachers education in partnership with Cardiff Met and said there was a big difference in what is happening at primary schools and secondary schools 
""Primary recruitment is very strong secondary is a different picture altogether unfortunately, we have some subject areas that are recruiting really well like P.E for example, but some of our science or our modern foreign language pathways are numbers are not where we need them and not where our profession needs them.
""And in Welsh medium, this is far lower in both primary and secondary than the demand requires.""
Mr Stewart said it was a positive move for the Welsh government to change the grade from a B to a C.
""It's much needed to tackle the crisis that we are facing in our secondary schools and in our Welsh medium provision and personally I feel there will be no impact on quality.
""I have had to turn away people in the past who didn't have the grade, who would have been great, so thinks it's a positive step forward and actually aligns us with the entry requirements for England.""
Welsh government said official figures showed teacher recruitment and retention remained stable.
It has also announced ""more incentives"" to join the profession, including reducing GCSE grade requirements from a B to a C in English or Welsh and Maths for teacher training.
Welsh government's new incentives include paying eligible student teachers a larger amount after their first term rather than at the end of their induction period.
It said it also recognised there was more to do but added there was a significantly lower ""leaving rate"" among secondary teachers in Wales compared to England."	/news/uk-wales-63800954
politics	Rishi Sunak vows to fix Liz Truss's mistakes in first speech as PM	"WATCH: Sunak on Truss: ""Some mistakes were made""
Rishi Sunak has pledged to fix ""mistakes"" made under Liz Truss's leadership and warned of ""difficult decisions"" ahead, in his first speech as prime minister.
He said he would restore trust, rebuild confidence and lead the UK through ""a profound economic crisis"".
Mr Sunak promised to deliver the manifesto that won the Conservatives a landslide election victory in 2019.
His speech outside No 10 came after he was appointed PM by King Charles.
UK's first British Asian prime minister, Mr Sunak announced his cabinet this afternoon, after telling Tory MPs to unify or face electoral oblivion.
In major reshuffle, Dominic Raab returned as deputy PM, and Grant Shapps became business secretary, while Jeremy Hunt remained as chancellor.
A large majority of MPs backed Mr Sunak for the leadership and when his only remaining rival Penny Mordaunt withdrew, there was no need for a ballot of Tory members.
Following Mr Sunak's speech, opposition parties repeated their demand for an immediate general election and argued Mr Sunak had no mandate from the public.
Mr Sunak's effective coronation as Tory leader on Monday spelled the end of Ms Truss's turbulent premiership, just 49 days after she took office.
Ms Truss became prime minister after defeating Mr Sunak in a ballot of Tory members during the summer, winning over members with her tax-cutting economic agenda.
But her government was destabilised by political and economic turmoil, exacerbated by her mini-budget, whose package of unfunded tax cuts has mostly been ditched.
In her farewell speech, Ms Truss defended her economic policies and said her time as prime minister convinced her of the need to be ""bold"".
In his own speech, Mr Sunak paid tribute to his predecessors Boris Johnson and Ms Truss, saying she ""was not wrong to want to improve growth in this country - it is a noble aim"".
""But some mistake were made,"" Mr Sunak said. ""Not born of ill will or bad intentions, quite the opposite, in fact. But mistakes nonetheless.
""I have been elected as leader of the party and as prime minister in part to fix them. And that work begins immediately.""
Mr Sunak - who was chancellor until July this year - said he would place ""economic componence and stability at the heart of this government's agenda"", warning that ""will mean difficult decisions to come"".
He gave no details about what those decisions were, but how to fund support for energy bills, and bring down government debt, are likely to be among them.
Mr Sunak is expected to cut public spending to plug an estimated Â£40bn hole in the public finances.
On his first day in office Mr Sunak spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ""to underline the United Kingdom's steadfast support for Ukraine"", a Downing Street spokesman said.
United States President Joe Biden said ""that the UK remains America's closest ally"" in another call, according to Downing Street. 
rime minister and President Biden also agreed to ""preserve"" the Good Friday peace deal, which set up power sharing in Northern Ireland.
It comes amid an ongoing row over the Northern Ireland Protocol - part of the post-Brexit deal between the UK and EU. 
Mr Sunak also spoke to the first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, and of Wales, Mark Drakeford. 
Ms Sturgeon said that the call with Mr Sunak had been ""constructive"", and Downing Street said Mr Sunak had emphasised their ""duty"" to work closely together. 
Mr Drakeford said the call had been a chance to ""discuss the importance of working together as four nations"" to address the ""urgent challenges"" faced by the UK.
mic challenges ahead for Mr Sunak loomed large in his speech, which he delivered in a solemn tone, outside his new residence at Downing Street.
He appeared on his own without his wife, Akshata Murty, and two daughters beside him.
He reminded the public of his decisions when he was chancellor during the Covid-19 pandemic, including the furlough scheme to help employers pay their staff.
While ""there are always limits"", Mr Sunak said, ""I promise you this: I will bring that same compassion to the challenges we face today.""
Other than a brief, television statement on Monday evening, this was the first the public had heard from Mr Sunak since he was elected Tory leader.
42-year-old former hedge fund boss, who has only been an MP for seven years, enters office at a time when his party is cratering in the polls.
As the party searched for its third leader this year, Mr Sunak's former boss - Mr Johnson - insisted he was the only person who could unite the Conservatives and win the next election.
Mr Johnson, who only resigned as prime minister in September, ultimately withdrew from the Tory leadership contest, admitting it was not the ""right time"" for a comeback.
Mr Sunak reflected on Mr Johnson's ""incredible achievements"" in his speech, but downplayed his sole ownership of the party's 2019 election victory.
rime minister said ""the mandate my party earned in 2019 is not the sole property of any one individual - it is a mandate that belongs to and unites all of us"".
""And the heart of that mandate is our manifesto,"" he said. ""I will deliver on its promise.""
If Mr Sunak moves too far away from his party's 2019 manifesto - which promised to ""level up"" the country - calls for an early general election may grow louder.
xt one is not due to take place until January 2025, at the latest, and Mr Sunak is under no obligation to hold one earlier under the UK's parliamentary system.
But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Sunak's refusal to call a general election showed his party ""does not trust the British people"", who ""will be rightly furious that they have been denied a say"".
Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said the country needed ""a fresh start"" after ""12 years of Conservative failure"", which Mr Sunak had been part of.
In a meeting with his shadow cabinet this morning, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warned his party against complacency, calling Mr Sunak a ""ruthless"" political operator.
Sir Keir said Mr Sunak ""will not deliver for working people"" and told his MPs to ""ignore the noise"", even if the new prime minister gives the Tories ""a significant poll bounce""."	/news/uk-politics-63388007
health	Covid-19: Indians told to mask up amid China coronavirus surge	"India's health minister has called for a return to Covid-appropriate behaviour, including wearing masks in public, as the country steps up surveillance of cases.
fficials have also asked people to get vaccinated and take booster doses.
India had relaxed its mask-wearing rules earlier this year after a drop in infection levels.
But a surge in cases in neighbouring China has put the country on alert.
Over the past few months, India reported four Covid-19 cases caused by BF.7, the Omicron subvariant linked to a spike in cases in China. 
- three in Gujarat state and one in Odisha - were detected in July, September and November and the patients have recovered, health officials have said.
According to government data, India currently has only around 3,400 active coronavirus cases, but reports of the surge in China have created a sense of fear among many people. 
Several experts have said that India - which witnessed two deadly waves of Covid in 2020 and 2021 - does not have reason to panic.
On Thursday, India's health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said in parliament that though cases in China were rising, those in India were ""depleting"". He added that the ministry was closely monitoring new variants and advised states to increase genome sequencing.
Earlier this week, the federal government had asked states to send samples of all Covid positive patients to labs runs by a health ministry forum which monitors various strains of Covid in India.
Mr Mandaviya also asked states to encourage people to follow social distancing and other rules during the upcoming festive season. 
Officials have now started conducting random Covid-19 tests on international passengers at airports .
India had relaxed air travel guidelines in November, making it optional - ""though preferable"" - for passengers to wear masks on flights and for international passengers to be fully vaccinated. There has been no official announcement about a change in air travel guidelines yet.
On Wednesday, Mr Mandaviya had chaired a high-level meeting with health officials to review the Covid situation in the country and appealed to people wear masks, maintain social distancing, wash hands frequently and get vaccinated.
Over 2.2 billion Covid vaccine doses have been administered so far in the country, but only 27% of the population have taken the booster dose - which India calls a ""precaution dose"" - so far. 
Chief ministers of several states have been reviewing their preparedness to deal with infections if needed. 
Later on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting to review the situation."	/news/world-asia-india-64061767
sports	From GAA to AFLW: The women kicking their way to Australia	"It's a cool night in the busy village of Camlough in County Armagh, where the green and white flags of Shane O'Neill's Gaelic Football Club adorn every lamp-post in sight.
Normally at a time like this, Blaithin Mackin would be right in the middle of the exciting build up with her two brothers preparing to battle it out in the Intermediate Championship Final later this month.
But she is far from home, waking up in Melbourne where she's taking on a whole new challenge of her own: semi-professional Australian Football League Women's (AFLW).
23-year-old is one of 22 Gaelic footballers to join the AFLW this year. 
""It does feel like a dream sometimes,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I can't believe that I am over here and playing a sport full time.""
""I've learned a lot. At home you are working full-time hours so you didn't get as much time to focus on the off-field stuff, like your nutrition, your recovery.
""Now that I have the time to do that and recover well and get myself ready for the next training session, it definitely makes a big difference.""
Established in 2017, the AFLW aims to become a full-time professional sport by 2026 and as it grows toward that goal, the players salaries have grown too.
While still a fraction of the average salary in the men's game - which is over AUD$370,000 (Â£210,000) - AFLW salaries almost doubled for the 2022 season.
will range from a minimum wage of AUD$39,184 (Â£22,235) to over AUD$70,000 (about Â£40,000) for top-tier players.
For Irish players coming from an amateur sport, the opportunity to earn while they play offers real opportunity to develop further as athletes. 
""It allows you the freedom to focus on your sport, compared to home where you're rushing your dinner into you and rushing your lunch, rushing to training,"" Mackin, who signed with the Melbourne Demons, said.
""It would have been a hard one for me to say no to because I really wanted to come to this level and step myself up as an athlete and a player, see what impact I can have and really challenge myself in this sport.""
Irish women have a lot to offer in return. 
While they may be less familiar with the oval ball and the finer points of the Australian game, they've been finessing the art of kicking from a very young age.
Unlike AFLW, Mackin said, the Ladies Gaelic Football Association (LGFA) structures have been in place for a long time with a strong under-age set up. 
""The Australian girls are more skilled but we would have been playing from the age of five or six and we have a kicking background, which is quite appealing for AFLW.
""Obviously our sport at home has grown so much as well, and the players skill and strength levels are growing, too, which helps.""
A star in her home county's football team, Mackin would only consider an AFLW contract if she could finish the season with them.
""Earlier this year when I started talking about it, when I was approached by AFLW Ireland, the first thing I said was that I wouldn't leave Armagh this year.
""I was already in the middle of a season with them and I had committed to it so that was the main thing for me. So I'm really grateful to Melbourne that they let me do that.""
Before this year, the Ladies Gaelic Football Association (LGFA) and AFLW seasons had lined up perfectly, with the Gaelic season finishing just in time for players to fly to Australia for AFLW pre-season training.
But the AFLW season has been brought forward this year, causing an overlap between the two.
Some clubs will allow the Irish players to miss part of pre-season but others will not, which is one of many factors that could determine how many Gaelic players make the transition in future.
""It's a very personal decision,"" Mackin said. ""It depends what you want, what stage in life you are at, your job at home. For some it wouldn't be worth it to come this far for this period of time.""
2022 season runs from August to November. 
""Some will want to stay on and travel or make Australia home, others will want to go back home to play for their county,"" she added.
But was the move from an amateur sport to semi professional a big jump in standards?
""Yes and no,"" Mackin said.
""The game at home has grown a lot so the standards Armagh would have set for us would be very similar and the amount of training sessions is probably fairly similar.
""Armagh has a great set up, we have a nutritionist, we have all the people in place and we always found time to fit in our strength work, our gym work.""
In Australia, there's just more of everything, she added.
""More masseuses, more physios, more strength and conditioning people, more nutritionists. There's more people that are being paid to support you throughout.""
In a few weeks time though Mackin will rise in the middle of the night to watch online her beloved Shane O'Neill's compete for a county title.
And while thankful for all the AFLW is offering her, her heart remains firmly in Armagh, where she intends to return next year for the 2023 Gaelic season."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63223010
entertainment	Unboxed: Spending watchdog to investigate government's Â£120m arts festival	"National Audit Office (NAO) is to examine the delivery and value for money of the Unboxed festival.
It comes after the chair of a parliamentary committee called for an investigation into the Â£120m arts festival, criticising it as an ""excessive waste of money"".
Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""We do not agree with the select committee's views.""
Unboxed was announced in 2018 by then prime minister Theresa May. 
UK-wide free event, which began in March and will run until November, features 10 projects highlighting science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics.
But the government's ""celebration of creativity"" was soon dubbed the Festival of Brexit, and has since had its visitor numbers questioned.
In late August, an article published in parliament's The House magazine claimed suggested there had been fewer than 240,000 visitors, despite a proposed target of 66 million.
However Unboxed told the BBC on Tuesday that ""the numbers reported misrepresent the public engagement with Unboxed, and reflect attendance at only eight of the 107 physical locations from within the programme"". 
Last month, Unboxed chief creative officer Martin Green told the BBC the festival was ""absolutely value for money"".
DCMS said on Tuesday that ""more than four million people have engaged in Unboxed programming so far, and these numbers are set to rise further"". 
Conservative MP Julian Knight, chair of the DCMS select committee, which holds the government department to account, has questioned the money spent on the festival ""during a cost of living crisis"".
rompted him to ask the NAO, the UK's independent public spending watchdog, to investigate.  
In a letter published on Tuesday, the NAO's comptroller and auditor general Gareth Davies, confirmed that the Unboxed organisers and government would now come under greater scrutiny over the event.
""I propose in in the coming months to publish a short, focused report on Unboxed which could act as the basis for future questioning during a committee session with DCMS,"" Mr Davies wrote.
He added he expected they should be able to report on the costs and benefits associated with the festival, along with its management and planning work - including forecasting of visitor numbers.
Mr Knight told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the event was ""unfortunately a monumental waste of money"".
""And it's something we've warned about,"" he added. ""And actually even within the department [it] was something that effectively they felt as if it was going off the rails. But no-one said, 'Stop, let's reassess. And if necessary, let's cancel.'""
However the DCMS responded by saying Unboxed had ""helped open up access to arts and culture across the country with an inclusive and ground-breaking programme of live and digital events, designed to bring people together and delivered in partnership with the devolved nations of the UK."".
Unboxed added that its commissions have been presented in ""more than 100 towns, cities and villages, engaged millions across live and digital and employed thousands of creatives around the UK"". 
Features of the festival include the See Monster installation in Weston-super-Mare - intended to promote the conversation about climate change - and Birmingham's PoliNations, as well as the About Us installation at Paisley Abbey in Scotland.
Unboxed organisers have not yet released official visitor numbers, but Mr Green told BBC Culture correspondent Katie Razzall last month that ""millions"" of people had engaged with it in person, and that he was ""very confident"" the festival would hit its visitor targets.
In June, the government said in response to its report on major cultural and sporting events that it disagreed with the committee's assessment of Unboxed, insisting it was ""being promoted globally"". "	/news/entertainment-arts-63203780
business	Fears for UK economy grow as higher prices bite	"Fears over the prospects for the UK economy have grown after it shrank again in April, with businesses feeling the impact of rising prices.
my contracted by 0.3% in April after it shrank by 0.1% in March, the Office for National Statistics said.
April's figure was weaker than expected, and it was the first time the economy has contracted for two months in a row since Covid struck.
Some analysts have warned the UK risks falling into a recession.
Both households and businesses have been hit by rising prices, which are surging at their fastest rate for 40 years due to record-high fuel and energy costs.
f filling up an average family car with petrol recently hit Â£100, and there have been signs that people are cutting back spending as costs rise.
Bank of England has warned the UK faces a ""sharp economic slowdown"", and has forecast that inflation - the rate at which prices rise - could reach more than 10% by the end of the year. 
April was the first time all main sectors of the economy - services, manufacturing and production - had shrunk since January 2021.
ONS said the main driver of April's contraction was in the services sector, due to the winding down of the NHS's Covid Test and Trace operation.
It also said some businesses were continuing to struggle with the impact of price increases and supply chain shortages.
JJ Foodservice, a wholesale food and catering company, supplies food products and ingredients from restaurants and takeaways to schools and private customers.
Kaan Hendekli, the firm's Head of Operations, told the BBC energy prices and skill shortages were hurting the businesses, but said the price of fuel was having the biggest impact because ""it affects everything"".
""Every product essentially hits a lorry - whether we deliver or we receive it from suppliers or our suppliers receive it from the manufactures,"" he said.
Mr Hendekli said the business was trying to be ""creative"" to reduce its outgoings, which included offering its customers good deals for collections and ordering in advance, as well as selling its own brand ingredients.
""Nobody wants to increase their prices but we've got no choice but to increase at the moment,"" he added.
""We are trying to find our own ways [to manage the situation].""
Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, said the UK looked ""at increased risk of a technical recession"", which is defined as the economy contracting for two consecutive three-month periods.
Danker, director-general of the CBI, said the business group was ""expecting the economy to be pretty much stagnant"".
""It won't take much to tip us into a recession, and even if we don't, it will feel like one for too many people,"" he added.
""Times are tough for businesses dealing with rising costs, and for people on lower incomes concerned about paying bills and putting food on the table.""
But Samuel Tombs, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a recession ""remains unlikely"", due to the government's recently announcement support package, which includes a Â£400 energy bill discount for all UK households.
Responding to the latest GDP figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not immune from global economic shocks, but added the government was ""fully focussed on growing the economy to address the cost of living in the longer term, while supporting families and businesses with the immediate pressures they're facing"".
Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the figures were ""extremely worrying"" and would ""add to growing concern about abysmal growth and plummeting living standards under the Conservatives"".
fall in GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in April was worse than expectations, but given the circumstances, can come as no surprise.
was the month of the record 54% hike in domestic energy bills, continued pressure at the pumps, the National Insurance hikes, and ongoing uncertainty from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Government sources pointed to the fact that the economy would have just about grown were it not for the one off effect of the winding down of pandemic test and trace services. However, by that logic, a number of previous GDP figures were also flattered by such figures.
re have been three months on the trot now of zero growth. Only in January has the UK economy grown this year. While May should break that pattern, the chances are that the economy is contracting over this quarter. 
Current forecasts suggest this should not be the start of a technical recession, especially given the support to household incomes from the energy package last month, but that risk certainly hangs over the economy. Though the jobs figures continue to impress, interest rates and inflation continue to rise. 
risk of a UK-EU trade war is now material, which could push up inflation more and risk investment. And there are further pressures on tax and spend from businesses calling for tax cuts, to public sector workers seeking pay rises matching double-digit inflation. 
ONS said there were ""some common themes"" being reported by firms that were having a negative impact across different industries. 
It said many firms reported how the soaring costs of petrol and diesel meant they had to pay more for materials or ""had to raise the price of the products they sold"".
""Other respondents also reported that large increases in utility bills, particularly for gas and electricity, had affected them,"" the ONS said.
Elsewhere, other firms reported price rises to other inputs such as animal feed, chemicals, aluminium, steel, cooking oil and fertiliser, while some respondents said they had ""difficulties"" in sourcing machinery, electronic components, kitchen appliances, and wire harnesses for cars."	/news/business-61780450

technology	Nvidia investigates melting graphics card cable reports	"Graphics card-maker Nvidia is investigating reports its latest cards may be causing power cables to melt.
Social-media users posted photos online appearing to show damage to the cable used to power the Nvidia RTX 4090, launched in October 2022.
med the graphics card, which retails for Â£1,699, was ""melting"" the adapter supplied in the box.
Nvidia told BBC News it was looking into the claims.
""We continue to investigate the reports - however, we don't have further details to share yet,"" it said. 
It was ""committed to supporting our customers"" and would provide an expedited return service.
graphics card is the most powerful yet from Nvidia - but this comes at a cost of drawing 450W of power - about half that of a typical microwave.
It allows gamers to play the latest releases at the highest fidelity yet - with 4K resolution and maxed-out settings.
graphics card proved popular at launch, with UK stock selling out on Nvidia's website within 10 minutes.
r has 12 pins, arranged in two rows of six. 
In the photos posted online, one or more of these pins appear malformed.
Jonathan, based in Sweden, one of the people who shared pictures of his graphics card on social media, told BBC News he had been ""really surprised and mad"" when he discovered the issue.
""I really need the graphics card for my work,"" he said. ""I cannot do any work without it.
""After the damage, I made a Reddit post, out of frustration - and later, Nvidia contacted me personally. The only thing they did was ask me to [return the card].
""Nvidia should make a public announcement about this issue.""
Another user, Nicholas, felt ""unlucky and a little sad"" when he checked his cable.
""Before I even saw the damage, I actually heard it as I was pulling the adapter out,"" he said. 
""The sound of plastic breaking was pretty bad - the top six pins were melted.""
Gordon Fitzsimmons, based in Glasgow, told BBC News he had thought the photos he had seen saw online were a result of user error - until he had received his card.
""You think these people must be abusing the cable,"" he said. ""They must be bending it really badly, or not plugging it in fully, so I was definitely blaming it on on the user - until, obviously, I opened mine up and [have] seen that one of the pins has just started to melt.
""It does make you very nervous, some of the posts I've seen, people are suffering real anxiety over this.""
Alex, based in Chicago, also said Nvidia's response after he discovered the fault in two separate graphics cards had been ""unacceptable"".
""The issue has not been resolved,"" he told BBC News. 
""It is evident by the fact that the replacement graphics card I received is also showing signs of melting. 
""There has been no official statement from Nvidia on the matter. 
""Nvidia and their partners should make a recall.""
Electrical Safety First product-safety engineer Giuseppe Capanna said: ""Issues surrounding melted plastic are indicative of a build-up of heat that should otherwise not be occurring to this level.

Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 10.1% in July, five times the Bank of England's (BoE) target.
Investment bank Citi said inflation was ""entering the stratosphere"" and could rise to 18%, while the Resolution Foundation said it could reach 18.3%.
BoE predicted inflation will rise to more than 13% in the coming months.
Citi's forecast - which would be the UK's highest rate of inflation since 1976 - comes ahead of Friday's energy price cap announcement on the maximum amount suppliers can charge households for gas and electricity from October.
ment bank's forecast is at the higher end of the scale compared to those made by other economists, such as EY-Parthenon which has forecast inflation to be at 15.4%.
However, economists at the Resolution Foundation think tank told the BBC that based on the current price cap predictions and the latest data on the rate prices are rising at, inflation could go as high as 18.3%. 
Citi's chief UK economist, Benjamin Nabarro, said affordability concerns were ""growing more deafening by the day"".
""The question now is what policy may do to offset the impact on both inflation and the real economy,"" he said.
Consultancy Cornwall Insight now expects a typical household energy bill to Â£3,554 a year from October. This is slightly below its previous forecast.
However, it now expects energy regulator Ofgem to announce a price cap in January of Â£4,650, which is higher than its previous estimate of Â£4,266. 
Its calculations reflected a 15% increase in wholesale prices in the last week, Cornwall said.
But the ""highly volatile nature of the market"" means these figures are expected to go up and down over the next couple of months, it added.
From October, all UK households will see their energy bill reduced by Â£400 through monthly instalments over six months, with a reduction of Â£66 in October and November, and of Â£67 a month from December to March 2023.
Eight million low-income households have already begun to get support for the rising cost of living, with the first instalment of payments totalling Â£650 hitting bank accounts in July.
But Citi said, without further government support, the price cap could hit Â£3,717 in October and Â£4,567 in January, reaching Â£5,816 in April.
Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, buying a pint would cost Â£25.
""People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around Â£5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,"" he said.
Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there were 10 food groups that have seen their prices rise more than 18.6% in the past year, including bread, milk, pasta and butter.
""Inflation at 18.6% would push millions of people into dire straits,"" she said.
""And because these horrible price hikes are being driven by the essentials people need to stay alive - like food and heat - it's going to hit those on lower incomes hardest, who've got nothing left to give.""
Bank of England has been raising interest rates since December and earlier this month implemented its largest increase - 0.5% - in 27 years to take borrowing costs to 1.75%.
But Citi said it expects the Bank to increase interest rates even higher, to as much as 7%, to control inflation.
On Monday European gas prices rose sharply due to supply fears, after Russian energy firm Gazprom announced it would shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline - the main gas export route to Germany - to complete three days of unplanned maintenance.
British gas for immediate delivery was also up 37% to 503p per therm. 
Oil and gas analysts at Investec said, in a briefing note, that it anticipated UK gas prices to remain elevated if Russia continues to restrict supplies to Europe. 
""This is remarkable in summer, when gas demand for heating is at its lowest,"" its analysts said.
""The outlook for UK/European gas prices are to remain high - even in 2025 it is three-times the 10-year average.""
Predicting the peak of inflation levels has been a mug's game in the last nine months. 
Bank of England originally predicted last year it would peak at 5%, then 10, then 13. HSBC recently revised its forecasts to 14% and on Monday global investment bank Citi set a new high watermark of 18%. 
Almost all of this inflation of inflation estimates has been caused by rocketing gas prices, which find their way into almost everything we buy. 
What is clear is that the forces that have propelled prices higher look like they are going to get worse before they get better.

sports	Tokyo 2020: UK Sport offers new investment for unfunded Olympic and Paralympic sports	"New investment for unfunded Olympic and Paralympic sports could ""make the difference"" between athletes qualifying for Tokyo 2020 or not, says the chief executive of Skateboard England.
A Â£3m Aspiration Fund has been launched by UK Sport in a bid to help more athletes compete at the Tokyo Games.
Sports eligible to apply include the five making their Olympic debuts in 2020, of which skateboarding is one.
British Handball said the new fund had ""come much too late"".
Funding agency UK Sport awards cash only to sports it believes can deliver medals, and skateboarding missed out on funding as it was judged not to have demonstrated medal potential.
All unfunded summer Olympic and Paralympic sports are eligible to apply for the new fund, as are sports in receipt of individual athlete medal support plan funding.
James Hope-Gill, who leads Skateboard England, said the body was ""very excited"".
""If we are successful in our application, this means that we will be able to give an opportunity to GB skateboarders to enter Olympic qualification events around the world so that they can gain ranking points,"" said Hope-Gill, who added it was an ""unexpected opportunity"".
""Many of our skateboarders currently aren't able to afford to travel to these events so the potential funding could make the difference between qualifying for the Games and not.""
British Surfing, which last month set up a crowdfunding page after also missing out on funding, also believes the Aspiration Fund could prove the difference.
""This sort of funding, carefully managed, can absolutely give them the best preparation for Olympic qualification,"" said director Nick Hounsfield.
British Handball said the opportunity had come over 10 months since teams began playing fixtures which will impact on their chances of reaching Tokyo 2020.
""Sadly this fund will be of little help to British Handball, and indeed many other unfunded sports, whose qualifying process for the Tokyo Games is already well under way,"" a statement read.
Grants awarded from the Aspiration Fund will run until the end of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic cycle.
It is also likely to benefit sports such as badminton, archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby, which all lost their funding after the Rio 2016 Olympics and Paralympics.
Badminton and archery earned a reprieve in February when some of their athletes were placed on the medal support plan.
""The Aspiration Fund will give more sports the chance to inspire the nation and shine at Tokyo 2020 and beyond,"" said sports minister Tracey Crouch.
""This Â£3m bridges a gap between grassroots and elite funding, and will help sports grow and develop future champions.
""UK Sport investment has transformed Britain into an Olympic and Paralympic powerhouse. But there are sports, not on UK Sport's world-class programme, that do a huge amount of good in communities that we can help on their path to the podium.""
Alongside their plans to qualify for Tokyo, sports must outline how they will use the funding to to capitalise on the impact of competing at the Games to ""engage and inspire communities"".
Liz Nicholl, chief executive of UK Sport, added: ""This new Aspiration Fund is a fantastic opportunity for some sports to get on track for the Tokyo Games.
""Many of the sports we are currently unable to support, while further away from reaching the podium, have great potential not only to inspire through their performances on the field of play but also to have a genuine social impact in communities across the UK."""	/sport/45827568
technology	Robot boat maps Pacific underwater volcano	"Watch USV Maxlimer as it moves through waters around Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Haâapai
A robot boat, controlled from the UK, has returned from an initial survey of the underwater Tongan volcano that erupted explosively back in January.
Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV) Maxlimer is part-way through mapping the opening, or caldera, of the underwater Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai (HTHH) volcano. 
, developed by the British company Sea-Kit International, is surveying the volcano as part of the second phase of the Tonga Eruption Seabed Mapping Project (TESMaP), led by New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) and funded by the Nippon Foundation of Japan.
far has confirmed earlier reports of continuing volcanic activity from HTHH. A winch on the boat allows instruments to be deployed at depths, reaching 300m, in order to collect data from the entire water column.
12m-long Maxlimer may be in Tonga, but it is being remotely controlled from 16,000km away in the small coastal village of Tollesbury in Essex. Everything is done over satellite link.
In a dark control room in Sea-Kit's HQ, several large screens display live feed images from the 10 cameras on board Maxlimer. Operators, who work in shifts around the clock, watch on as real-time data gets beamed in from the South Pacific. 
""We can communicate with nearby vessels via radio as if we were on board""
Ashley Skett, director of operations at Sea-Kit, told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science programme that the operators can even communicate via radio with other vessels in the area, so much so that other boats wouldn't know that nobody was on board Maxlimer. 
""The boat has been designed from the ground up to be remotely controlled and remotely operated. So every switch, every function on the boat, every light, we can control from here.""
Robotic, remotely controlled boats are likely to be the future of maritime operations. When surveying a dangerous area such as the active HTHH volcano, remote control ensures no crew are put in harm's way.
re are also environmental benefits to USVs. As there is no onboard crew to support, the vessel can be much smaller, leading to reduced carbon dioxide emissions.
""We use 5% of the fuel that an equivalent manned vessel doing the same job that we're doing now would use,"" Ashley said.
ruption of HTHH in January caused extensive damage far beyond Tonga, triggering a massive tsunami that spread across the Pacific Ocean. The atmospheric shockwave caused by the eruption was felt as far away as the UK.

Maxlimer is currently taking a short break while some rough weather passes through the region.  Once conditions improve, the boat will head back out to the underwater volcano to fill in remaining gaps in its map of the caldera.
will help us understand why the eruption had such a huge and violent impact, as well as help predict the nature of future eruptions."	/news/science-environment-62606589
business	Chicken price rises: 'By far the worst we've had it in 23 years'	"rice of chicken is on the increase - those in the industry say the war in Ukraine, energy prices and Brexit are all resulting in higher costs. How are the price rises affecting chicken production from farm to fork?
Stephen Wigginton runs a hatchery near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, where thousands of eggs are incubated each week ready to be delivered across the UK.
He says compared to a year ago ""we're probably in a worse state now with the ever-increasing electric costs, fuel costs, vaccine costs, cardboard costs, that we as a small business have had to endure.
""We've also got the issues with Brexit, has given our costs a slightly higher edge,"" the 66-year-old says.
He says his electricy bill has gone from Â£200 a month last to just over Â£600 a month. 
""The cardboard boxes we put the chicks in used to cost us Â£800 per 1,000 - now it's more than Â£1,000 per 1000,"" he says.
Mr Wigginton adds the vaccine he needs for the animals has increased in price by 8%.
He says the companies he supplies with chicks ""are doing the best that they can to produce the best quality food that they can at an affordable price and that now it is getting very difficult because they've got additional costs, whether it's gas, feed, or processing costs"".
He says in his 23 years running the business it is ""by far the worst that we've had it"".
Emma Cross started her animal feed business in Ely, Cambridgeshire, two years ago in lockdown.
""It's been more difficult because obviously prices are going up, every time I order feed in from my wholesaler it's gone up a considerable amount so I have to be careful adding on my margin, it's quite difficult,"" she says.
52-year-old says: ""Everything is going up at moment but it's quite scary how certain things have gone up a lot.""
Her costs have gone up by more than 20% and ""are still rising"", she says.
Wheat, a key ingredient in chicken feed, has almost doubled in price because Russia and Ukraine produce about 30% of the global supply.
She says she is ""baffled"" feed is imported into the UK.
""We're in the middle of farming land, we shouldn't have to import corn and grain, it should be grown in the country,"" she adds.
Business development manager Dan Simpson runs a chicken restaurant and takeaway in Hitchin, Hertfordshire. 
He says the price of chicken has ""nearly doubled across the board"".
""In December we were paying just under Â£20 a box for chicken wings now we're looking Â£26, Â£27 a box.
""The inner fillet that we use for our strips were just under Â£30, now we're looking about Â£50.
""Fresh chicken almost overnight skyrocketed.""
He believes price increases are down to Brexit, higher fuel and energy prices and the war in Ukraine.
""The whole world is linked, something can happen half-way around the world and we feel it here in Hitchin,"" he says.
Mr Simpson says shops like his are at the ""bottom of the ladder, chains can bulk-buy, independent businesses are always up against it - this has made it much harder"".
He says he has raised the prices in the restaurant but ""we didn't want to, it was the very last resort as our profit margins were shrinking so much"".
wider cost of living has also had an impact on the business, he says: ""We have seen a bit of dip during the week, people are doing as more of a treat at the weekend.""

politics	Climate change: State-owned wind farm 'could cut bills'	"Plans for a publicly owned energy company could see bills reduced and renewable supplies directly benefit communities, a minister has said. 
roposal is for a joint venture between the Welsh government and developers.
Profits would be used to construct wind turbine sites owned by communities.  
Climate Change Minister Julie James says ""it sticks in my craw"" that foreign governments get profits from wind farms in Wales. 
Ms James said communities would benefit from either owning turbines, getting homes fitted to save energy or from lower bills .  
""This will be a company that brings more of the profits back to the people of Wales directly, in the form of a state developer, but we will have to do that in a joint venture partnership with a range of other providers,"" she said.
At the moment, many big wind farms across Wales are foreign-owned, in some cases by other governments, with profits helping to fund their public services. 
ggest wind farm in Wales and England is at the heads of five valleys across south Wales.
Pen y Cymoedd, owned by Vattenfall, has 76 turbines that generate enough electricity for nearly 190,000 homes - one sixth of homes in Wales. 
generate profits for the Swedish state, which owns Vattenfall, with profits going towards heating Swedish hospitals, schools and other public services.
Rahel Jones, from Vattenfall, said the company has spent Â£300m in Wales in the past eight years and was not put off by the Welsh government's plans.
""Competition is good,"" she said.
""We can all work together to deliver the energy system we need and tackle climate change.""
A new wind farm is being developed between Port Talbot and Maesteg by the Irish government, owned by ESB and Coriolis, generating enough electricity for 100,000 homes. 
Gwynt y MÃ´r, the offshore wind farm in north Wales, is owned by RWE, based in Germany. It has also taken over Innogy Renewables which built Wales' third largest wind farm near Brechfa, where there are 28 turbines. 
Ms James said: ""In the previous industrial revolution in Wales, the wealth of Wales were worked by its people, the profits were exported away. We need to make sure that doesn't happen again.""
Under its proposals, the Welsh government would help a developer with access to land, planning process, infrastructure and negotiations with the National Grid. 
r would bring in funding or venture capital - the money needed to get the project going, with the aim of having its investment returned when it makes profit. 
re would be a package so that the community benefited directly, and profits would be shared, with the Welsh government using its share for another project.
However, Ms James added that ""each joint venture will be developed differently, each site will have a different set of criteria"".
While there are existing community energy projects, the Welsh government said its proposals would include more community benefit and involvement.
""Some of the turbines will be directly owned by the community,"" said Ms James. 
She also wants ""off-grid"" communities who do not have oil or mains gas to get power directly from the turbines, if possible, making it cheaper, or energy efficiency improvements made to homes. 
Dyfan Lewis from Community Energy Wales wants decisions about how the money is spent to be decided at a local level.  
He said: ""We want to see the money go to community initiatives, funding different social businesses or helping people in fuel poverty. They have the choice then of where to use that money and how to do it best""
Communities have been getting money from wind farms already - for people living near Pen y Cymoedd, there is an annual fund of Â£1.8m they can bid into. 
Our Space, or Ein Lle Ni in Welsh, has had Â£81,500.  
Sylvia Strand and Jonathan Gregory, film and television music composers from Treherbert, Rhondda Cynon Taf, are working with people to record their stories. 
Ms Strand said the project was a way for ""the people of this area to tell the history of this area, from the ice age to the present day, in their own words"".
Recording in various locations, they work with 10 community groups with participants ranging from eight to 98 years old with contributors including a woodland therapy group and choirs."	/news/uk-wales-63917570
business	âMy bus ticket was more than I got paid an hourâ	"ungest workers have seen the minimum wage rise by less than older colleagues - as the latest employment figures reveal average wages are not keeping up with the rising cost of living.
As a BBC Young Reporter, I wanted to look at this further because of my own experiences at work. 
I've had part-time jobs since I was 15, often earning the minimum wage. As a younger worker that meant I was paid less than older colleagues - even when I was doing the same work. 
It's something I've found really unfair, and I don't think younger people always feel like they can stand up for themselves at work. 
It's a issue some of my friends say they've also experienced. 
""It's frustrating,"" says 15-year-old Isabella, who left her job in a restaurant because she earned less than her colleagues - with the only difference being that she couldn't serve alcohol.
""It was a small place and we were all doing the same thing, but for different amounts,"" she says.
Isabella was being paid the minimum wage - which at the time was Â£4.62 an hour for people aged under 18. ""The bus ticket into town, for the day, was around Â£4.80 I think, so my bus ticket was more than I was earning per hour."" 
Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that minimum rates of pay have gone up less for those under 20 than for older workers since 2016.
In April, the minimum wage went up to Â£4.81 per hour for those under 18, a 24% increase on the rate in 2016, which was Â£3.87 per hour. 
But for 21 and 22-year-olds it rose by 37% over the same period, from Â£6.70 to Â£9.18 per hour. And it climbed by 42% to Â£9.50 per hour for 23 and 24-year-olds.
r cohort have since 2017 been paid what is known as the National Living Wage. Originally for over-25s, it has been extended to all workers over 23, and there are plans to lower the threshold further to 21 by 2024.
Later this month, the Low Pay Commission - an independent body that advises the government - will make its recommendations on what minimum wage rates should be for next year. The Commission says its remit is to push pay for younger workers as high as possible without damaging their employment prospects.  
Richard Davies, Professor of Public Understanding of Economics at Bristol University, tells me that's important because ""if you have a long period of being unemployed when you're young, that can affect you for the rest of your life"".
He also explains that the lower minimum wage for young people also ""rests on the idea that they will have fewer skills and lower productivity than older workers"", adding that there is also an assumption that young people are getting something back.
""The deal is that by going to work, you're also being trained. So the firm is giving you something - and that makes it fair that they pay you a little less.""
's certainly something Nick Collins believes his business, Loungers, offers. 
More than 6,000 people work for the bar and restaurant chain - and 40% are under 21. 
""We used to pay everyone the same,"" he says. ""But when the National Living Wage started to climb it became less affordable for us."" 
New starters joining his company are now paid less if they're under 18 or under 21, but he says they can ""progress quickly"" and once they're in more senior roles are paid the same regardless of age. 
""We agonised over it a lot, we didn't like doing it,"" he says, adding that all under-18s and under-21s earn at least Â£8 per hour - more than the minimum wage. 
But Mr Collins acknowledges that attracting and retaining staff in hospitality is getting harder - competing with sectors like retail where hours can be more sociable and pay can be higher.
""I'd love to pay everyone more, but we just wouldn't be able to sustain that,"" he tells me.
I now work in a supermarket where I earn more than Â£10 an hour. Everyone there is paid the same regardless of their age, including my school friend Tabitha, who works there too.
She left a job at a bowling alley where she was being paid the minimum wage.
""It was awful,"" she says. ""The pay didn't match up to the work we had to do - there was a lot of stress."" 
""The older people would be working on the bar, standing around chatting, and the younger people would be running around, really busy, trying to make sure the jobs were finished.""
As for asking for a pay rise, Tabitha says it ""simply doesn't happen when you're this young"", adding that ""no one takes you seriously"".
But that may be changing. 
As the latest figures show the unemployment rate at its lowest for nearly 50 years, Tony Wilson from the Institute for Employment Studies says young people are ""voting with their feet.""
""We've got the highest number of people changing jobs that we've ever seen,"" he says. ""That is prompting employers to try and treat people better around pay and around fairness at work.""
So is there an argument for paying everyone the same, regardless of age? Perhaps not everyone, says Tony Wilson.
""My worry would be that if employers had to pay 16 and 17-year-olds Â£9.50 an hour, they just wouldn't do it,"" he tells me. 
""But when you get up to ages 18, 19, or 20, I think it's harder to justify paying people Â£6 something an hour when their colleagues are getting Â£9 something an hour.""
A spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said:  ""While we know the priority for younger workers in those first years is to secure work and gain experience, we are nevertheless determined to ensure it pays properly.""

health	Inquest told stranger's details used in care plan at Wymondham home	"Care home staff copied details of the wrong person into a woman's care plan in the weeks before she died, an inquest has heard.
Janice Hopper, 74, was taken to hospital from Windmill House, in Wymondham, Norfolk last January after she stopped taking fluids.
ring was told of failures at the home and delays in addressing them.
Coroner Jacqueline Lake concluded she died from natural causes but will issue a Prevention of Future Deaths Report. 
Mrs Hopper had been admitted to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital with a fractured hip in December 2021.
Attempts to discharge her to a community hospital failed due to a lack of beds and she was subsequently sent to the care home on New Year's Eve.
Maria Stone, a care team leader, was unable to explain why Mrs Hopper's date of admittance was recorded on her care plan as 22 July 2022. 
urt was also shown a documentation intended to show her food and drink needs due to her diabetes but the relevant boxes were empty.
Under a section titled Infection Control Policy, a passage read ""George and my family are happy with being tested"", along with further details of that person's requirements.
was taken from another resident's care plan.
Mrs Lake asked whether it had been ""cut and pasted"". 
Ms Stone replied: ""I can't remember.""
Elsewhere, the document described Mrs Hooper as ""a sociable man"".
Mrs Hopper's husband Christopher cross-examined several of the witnesses himself and told the court the family felt his wife's short time at the home had worsened her Alzheimer's.
Mrs Lake highlighted a lack of action on the part of the care home to address the shortcomings.
""It is clear some action has only just been taken,"" she said. ""Still not all these steps have been started and many remain outstanding and on that basis I do propose writing a [Prevention of Future Deaths Report].""
Kerry Tidd, who also works at the home, told the hearing: ""We have put a lot in place as a result of what's happened.
""Things are changing,"" she said. ""The culture in the home is changing.""

business	Londonderry city deal: Council seeks further funding	"Derry and Strabane councillors have agreed to write to the UK Treasury requesting additional funding for its city deal at a meeting on Tuesday. 
It comes after councillors were informed plans may have to be scaled back in light of inflation. 
uncil will also seek support from the Department of Finance due to ""construction inflation and further financial pressures"".
In the deal, funding of Â£250m will be invested in the region over 15 years.
It has hopes of creating 7,000 jobs and is the largest single investment made in the region with the potential to add about Â£210m a year to the area's economy.
major projects are proposed within the deal, with a focus on health and life sciences and digital industries.
At Tuesday night's meeting, Derry City and Strabane District Council chief executive John Kelpie told councillors the difficulties facing the city deal projects mean their benefits ""will be reduced"".
Mr Kelpie said progressing other major projects such as university expansion and infrastructural projects in parallel with the city deal was always deemed as important, but inflationary costs were an issue.
Some of the projects proposed in the deal include:
Speaking at the meeting, DUP cllr Maurice Devenney said costings were now ""a lot greater than expected"" and asked what those involved in Belfast city deal are doing ""to balance their books around budgets"".
SDLP cllr Brian Tierney added that the letter to the Treasury should reflect that the project was always intended to be a partnership and the council were ""never the sole carriers of this"". 
He added: ""It's not fair that because the prices go up, this council and the citizens of this district have to carry the can. If there are difficulties financially, all of the partners have to come together to sort out these issues. 
""The only way we can sort them out is by re-jigging the projects. Any response to the inflationary costs has to be met by the British government."" 
An update report by the council cited the ""growing scale and impact of increasing construction, materials and energy costs and inflation due to current national and global economic circumstances"".
It stated: ""The overall consequence of the above is that, at present, cost estimates for almost all of the projects as envisaged at Strategic Outline Case stage and developed since, are currently projected to be very considerably in excess of the available funding.""
report suggested solutions will include ""a range of considerations such as a reduction in complexity to some of the projects, mitigation of site specific issues highlighted through initial design development which have led to increased cost projections, adjustments to design and specifications etc and application of additional budget if possible by individual project partners""."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-63801500
technology	The social media lifeline amid soaring food costs	"Every morning, Tina Harrison logs on to the Facebook page for Trinity Foodbank in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, to check for new messages. As the cost of living crisis deepens, more and more people, she says, have been getting in touch to say they've run out of food and need help.
Mrs Harrison, a former nurse - or one of her fellow volunteers - will reply. They try to offer some form of assistance to everybody. 
Many people ask permission: is it OK to come and receive a food parcel? ""It's always, 'Yes, it's OK,'"" says Mrs Harrison. Before the pandemic, the food bank handed out around 20 parcels per week. That figure has nearly quadrupled in more recent times. 
""It's just going to get worse, I think,"" says Mrs Harrison, describing how some parents have told her that they sit in bed with their children to watch TV on some evenings, just to keep warm.
rising cost of food and energy is affecting people from all walks of life, she adds, from single people to families. But households with children could find the summer months particularly difficult. 
While many local authorities are launching holiday meal voucher or cash payment schemes, some children won't have as easy access to food during the day as they would when in school. During the pandemic, the government U-turned on its previous policy of not providing free school meals to children in England over the holidays.
But teaching unions have argued recently that the offer of these meals ought to be extended due to the cost of living crisis.
financial hardship facing many families is prompting more of them to approach their local food bank or community support network, perhaps for the first time. Many are making that initial contact via Facebook or other social media sites.
rinity Foodbank doesn't just offer food, Mrs Harrison stresses. There's friendly help and advice about how to budget and how to claim grants or benefits. 
Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan), which connects hundreds of food aid providers, has produced leaflets with financial advice for people in need. There are interactive versions online, as well.
""When you've got a problem as widespread as this, you just come up with as many ways as possible of reaching people,"" says Sabine Goodwin, Ifan co-ordinator.
Food banks are also using social media to advertise for donations because they have noticed a drop in such support lately. ""They're running out of food a lot of the time,"" says Ms Goodwin. This is because people who would usually support their local food bank have also been hit by spiralling costs.
""Nearly everyone is on social media now,"" says Mark Wells, founder of the Food Facts Friends food bank in Midlothian. He describes how he has used Facebook lately to post pictures of relatively bare shelves in the food bank store, in an effort to inspire donations.
""I've just set up an account with TikTok,"" he says, referring to the video-sharing site. Mr Wells hopes that young people will find videos of the food bank's fare and show their parents so that people know what's available, should they need it.
rt of content can help connect people to food aid providers in their area, says Brooke Bennett at the University of Connecticut's Rudd Center for Food Policy & Health. 
In a recent study, she and colleagues asked summer meal providers how they signposted their services to families in Connecticut. They reported higher online engagement, and more in-person visitors, when they posted photos of whatever food would be available on a particular day.  
Some providers pay a small fee to promote these posts as well. ""You can really target an audience that you know is in your zip code, your area,"" says Dr Bennett.
In 2020, the Food Foundation, a UK charity, and marketing agency PLMR launched a map to signpost the locations of businesses offering free meals to children during the October half-term holiday, when free school meals weren't available. 
Around 50,000 users visited the map during that time. Given the government U-turn on holiday meals, there are no plans to relaunch this map, the Foundation says. 
However, there are other, localised tools that make it easy for people to find out what help is available near to them, such as the interactive Google Map maintained by Feeding Liverpool. It shows the locations of food clubs and community shops around the city. 
""It's one of the best things we've done,"" says Naomi Maynard, good food programme director. ""It's so simple but just giving people the knowledge of what's in their local area is so empowering.""
Users are able to search for providers that cater for dietary requirements, such as vegetarian, gluten-free, kosher or halal, she notes.
Digital platforms are not panaceas for food insecurity, notes Georgiana Nica-Avram at Nottingham University Business School. However, such services can help people to access support in a dignified way.
""Not many people may want to publicly acknowledge that they are going through this themselves or they may not have an extensive network of support,"" she explains.
In partnership with the food-sharing app Olio, Dr Nica-Avram and colleagues have studied how some people use Olio to support themselves during times of severe hardship.
Sadly, there is no doubt that the coming months will prove very difficult for lots of families. Many parents who stop by Trinity Foodbank in Radcliffe also mention their concerns about the coming winter, and the high heating costs they expect then, notes Mrs Harrison. 
More technology of business:
A Department for Education spokeswoman says the government recognises that millions of households are struggling with rising prices. 
""The Holiday Activities and Food programme runs during major school holidays,"" she adds.
""Wider welfare support is available for families through the Household Support Fund, which helps vulnerable families in need with essentials, such as food and utility bills."" A total of Â£37bn of public money is currently available to support households during the cost of living crisis.
Mrs Harrison and her fellow volunteers are determined to keep providing whatever help they can, despite the pressure also facing those who normally donate to the food bank.
""I think at the moment we're just riding with the times, a bit like we did with Covid, really,"" she says."	/news/business-62034982
sports	Australia 55-54 England: Donnell Wallam scores winner after sponsorship row	"Donnell Wallam said it had been ""one of the toughest weeks of her life"" after scoring a last-minute winner as Australia beat England 55-54 in the first of their three-match series.
Wallam, 28, is the first Indigenous player to feature for the Diamonds in more than two decades.
But the build-up to her debut was overshadowed by mining company Hancock Prospecting pulling their A$15m (Â£8.4m) sponsorship deal with Netball Australia after she privately raised concerns about the company's Indigenous record.
quad's only Aboriginal player ,Wallam is widely reported to have told team-mates she was uncomfortable wearing the company's logo, while they then reportedly also refused to wear it in solidarity with her.
Wallam is said to be particularly concerned about racist comments made by Hancock Prospecting's founder Lang Hancock in 1984.
In a TV interview, he suggested Aboriginal people should ""breed themselves out"", adding: ""I would dope the water up so that they were sterile... that would solve the problem.""
On Saturday, Hancock Prospecting said the sponsorship deal would no longer go ahead, despite reports that Wallam was willing to wear the logo after the pressure became ""too much to bear"".
Its executive chairman Gina Rinehart - Australia's richest citizen and one of the biggest private investors in Australian sport - is the daughter of Lang Hancock.
In pulling the deal, Hancock Prospecting and Rinehart expressed frustration that sport was being ""used as the vehicle for social or political causes"".
ment: ""There are more targeted and genuine ways to progress social or political causes without virtue signalling or for self-publicity.""
mpany then defended itself by saying it helps provide training, employment and education opportunities in Aboriginal communities, as well as making significant royalty payments to traditional owners for mining their land.
Wallam started the match against England's Roses on the bench in Newcastle, New South Wales but was given a huge ovation when she came on in the fourth quarter, becoming the third indigenous Australian to play for the Diamonds.
She scored with her very first touch, adding six more before netting the winner with seven seconds left on the clock.
She told Fox Sports: ""I was kind of relieved to finally get my chance on court. It has been one of the toughest weeks of my life so to get out on the court was really special.
""It's really special, I just hope I'm now a role model to the young girls and boys coming through for their turn.""
It is the first time since 2018 that the Roses have played in Australia after their planned 2021 tour was cancelled due to Covid-19 restrictions.
Eleanor Cardwell earned her 50th cap as Jess Thirlby's side pushed the world champions throughout a tight encounter, holding a one-goal lead at half-time.
""We wanted to show we can compete and make sure our strategies are robust enough to compete with the best team in the world and I think we gave a fair account of that,"" said Thirlby.
""It was great that we were in the lead at times, the Diamonds came back at us but we responded and we never let the game get away from us and I think that's a big step forward.""

health	Isle of Man pledge to carry out more eye ops to slash backlog	"An Â£18.3m drive to cut surgery waiting times on the Isle of Man will see more complex eye operations carried out this month.
Manx Care chief Teresa Cope said the cataract procedures will be done in partnership with private firm Synpatik.
rage waiting time for eye patients to receive treatment has been estimated at about 58 weeks, with hundreds waiting to be seen.
renewed push should see the backlog reduce, Ms Cope added.
king place in December will involve patients under general anaesthetic, though operations which do not require sedation will also continue, a Manx Care spokeswoman said. 
Manx Care is aiming to cut the 58-week wait to 18 weeks, while reducing waits in orthopaedics from 46 weeks to four, and general surgery from 43 weeks to three.
rty open hernia operations are also planned to take place in December as part a wider effort to see times fall across the board. 
It comes after Tynwald approved giving Manx Care an Â£18.3m cash boost to slash hospital waiting times by working with Synaptik to see about 3,800 general surgery, ophthalmology and orthopaedic patients treated by April 2023. 
Scottish healthcare firm has already worked with health authorities on the Isle of Man to deliver more than 400 endoscopy procedures and 350 cataract operations earlier this year, 
Manx Care's request for funding comes after the Isle of Man government tasked it with cutting waiting times down to an 18-week referral to treatment time.

politics	Brexit: NI Protocol doesn't change constitution, Supreme Court told	"re has been no constitutional change as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a barrister for the UK government has told the Supreme Court.
Part of the Brexit deal, the protocol creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
It is challenged by unionist politicians who say it breaches the Acts of Union and the Northern Ireland Act.
However Tony McGleenan KC said their arguments were ""seriously overplayed.""
Mr McGleenan told the court ""the idea that there has been a de facto termination of the union is not a tenable proposition"".
Earlier this year the Court of Appeal suggested the Supreme Court should examine whether a modification of the Acts of Union by the protocol amounted to a change in Northern Ireland's constitutional status.
On Wednesday the applicants' barrister told the court the Acts of Union were the ""fundamental constitutional structure"" of the UK.
John Larkin KC focused on the part of the Acts of Union which states Northern Ireland must be on an ""equal footing"" with Great Britain when it comes to trade.
""The protocol, taken as a whole and when one looks at some of its individual provisions in-depth, undoubtedly conflicts with Article 6 of the Acts of Union and we say this is acknowledged by the respondent,"" Mr Larkin said.
Mr McGleenan said there had been ""much misunderstanding"" about what the protocol meant for the Acts of Union.
He said there was ""a view abroad that the Act of Union has been repealed or subjugated"".
However he said Parliament had taken the democratic decision to approve the protocol and disapply parts of the Acts of Union where they are inconsistent with the protocol.
He described this as ""modest disapplication, subject to a democratic process, mandated by parliament"".
He added that it was ""entirely wrong to say there has been a breach of the Act of Union or there has been repeal of the Act of Union - much of what flows in the rest of the argument flows from that fundamental misconception"".
On Wednesday, Mr Larkin said the protocol had ""fundamentally changed"" Northern Ireland's position within the UK, in a way that was ""incompatible with the guarantee"" provided in the Northern Ireland Act, the legislation which implements the Good Friday Agreement.
He said that law was designed to guarantee constitutional change would not take place ""without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland in a referendum"".
However Mr McGleenan said the Northern Ireland Act only dealt with the ""key binary constitutional question"" of whether Northern Ireland remained in the UK or became part of a united Ireland.
He said the impacts of the protocol were ""a world away"" from this.
In written submissions, Mr Gleenan also argued the decision to agree the Brexit withdrawal agreement and protocol was ""non-justiciable"", or not suitable for a judge to decide.
""The appellants have repeatedly sought to challenge the very permissibility of the negotiations with the European Union about the terms of exit from the EU and the power to reach agreement on the terms that were agreed,"" he said.
""It remains the case that any engagement between the government and the EU on the terms of exit from the EU are non-justiciable matters.
""They relate to the conduct of foreign affairs; and are in the realm of politics, and are in nature entirely unsuited to determination by a court on a judicial review application.""
Mr McGleenan added that the ""exclusion of courts from political questions"" was well-established.
ring has finished and the Court will deliver a judgement some time in 2023.
Meanwhile, the president of the European Commission has said that if ""there's the political will in the UK"" the EU can reach a ""positive conclusion"" with it over the Northern Ireland protocol.
Ursula von der Leyen made her remarks at a joint news conference with Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin.
Addressing both houses of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) later on Thursday afternoon as part of a two-day visit to Ireland, Ms von der Leyen referred to  ""a new pragmatic spirit"" in talks with London.
She said her contacts with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were encouraging and Ireland could count on continued EU support. 
She told the Oireachtas ""there can be no hard border on the island of Ireland"".
President von der Leyen was making her address to mark 50 years of Irish membership of what is now the European Union.
""Brexit will not become an obstacle to the path of reconciliation,"" she added."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63818935
sports	England-Wales World Cup bid could 'transform' hockey	"An ambitious plan for England and Wales to host the biggest hockey World Cup yet could help transform the sport, according to Wales captain Rupert Shipperley.
wo nations have submitted a joint bid to host the men's World Cup in 2026 across four venues - with the final matches being played at Tottenham Hotspur's 62,000-seater stadium.
revious men's World Cup held in the UK was in London back in 1986.
International Hockey Federation (FIH) will announce the host, or hosts, in November - with Germany and South Africa among the rival bidders.
""It's a bit nerve-wracking to think we could be playing in front of 62,000 people,"" Shipperley told BBC Sport Wales at an event at the Tottenham stadium.
""This is the biggest stadium I've ever been to - as player but also as a fan of any sport. So it'd be massive for the sport and a new experience for hockey.
""If you'd had said ten years ago I'd be stood here saying potentially in a couple of years we could be playing on this pitch, I'd have laughed at you. There's a real opportunity to transform the game of hockey on the international stage.""
matches of the 16-team event will be played at Cardiff Arms Park, Twickenham Stoop in London and Franklin's Gardens in Northampton.
It would be the first time Wales has hosted World Cup fixtures. Its national sides have only been to one World Cup before - the women's event in Malaysia in 1983.
men's side have qualified for their first World Cup in India in January.
""It's nice to see the recognition we're getting,"" said goalkeeper Toby Reynolds-Cotterill, whose shoot-out saves were instrumental in Wales' qualification for the 2023 event.
""We've had quite a journey over the last eight years. Now qualifying for the World Cup in January and hopefully going to the next one [in 2026], it's nice to see the recognition of us and a federation.
""Hopefully we can get some very good crowds, especially if we're playing in Cardiff. The support we'd get would be unreal.""
England Hockey chief executive Nick Pink said the bid team wanted to go 'bold' with the event.
""It's about putting hockey into new environments,"" he said.
""It'd be absolutely incredible to have 62,000 people watching here [in Tottenham]. It's about that transformation and pushing the sport into a different realm.
""But the second part is the legacy and the social impact. We always wanted this to be a project that took the sport right across the UK.
""Taking it right into the heart of a major city like Cardiff is just fantastic for us. It's about getting Welsh fans and Welsh communities excited about the sport of hockey. They see it in rugby and other major sports - but they've not seen hockey in that space before.
""That for me is the drive to try to engage new communities, new audiences and sustain our sport for future generations."""	/sport/hockey/62987093
sports	Erriyon Knighton on Tokyo, Oregon, Paris and beyond	"Erriyon Knighton's Twitter biography is short and to the point: ""Professional track athlete."" 
But there is a link below. A link that, via a search and scroll, leads to footage of an athlete who is neither on the track, nor professional.
with a wide shot of a high school American football pitch. 
Cheerleaders on the sidelines. A crowd of about 100 spectators in the bleachers. A Friday Night Lights scene. 
A slender, rangy figure in home-team red gathers a kick return on his 10-yard line. He looks up, spots a hole in the onrushing defence and darts through, evading a tangle of limbs. 
He hits halfway at a gallop. A final defender comes haring across, all pumping thighs and straining arms. But, it's in vain. The home team holler on the touchline as their man's easy, fluid stride eats up the field and carries him to the endzone.
It is just the start of a four-minute highlights reel,external-link posted in June 2020. 
And plenty were watching. Knighton's speed, 6ft 3in frame, sure hands and aggression had the country's best college football programmes - Alabama, Florida State, Tennessee and others - preparing offers. 
But, as the pandemic bit, the points switched. Knighton was sent down a different path.
""It could have gone differently if high school season was still going,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I probably would still have been playing football if I would've had that extra year.""
Instead, as school gridiron grew cold amid an enforced shutdown, a 16-year-old Knighton focused on his side hustle: track. 
He had been sprinting for a little over a year, after being encouraged to do so by his football coach as a way to sharpen his game as a wide receiver. 
""I only started running track in the ninth grade,"" Knighton remembered.
""Before then you could have asked me what 100m was and I wouldn't have known. I knew nothing about track.
""By the end of that year, I realised that I was kind of separated from the pack and faster than most people.""
And they have never caught up. 
Knighton, unable to compete locally because of lockdowns, took part in the nationwide Junior Olympics, just a couple of months after posting his latest football highlights video online. 
Running in 200m against other 16-year-olds, he stormed home in 20.33 seconds. As you watch the footage,external-link you can hear one voice from the stands swear in disbelief as the stagger unfurls and the extent of Knighton's yawning advantage is revealed.
Only Usain Bolt had ever gone faster at under-18 level. Only three Americans of any age - Noah Lyles, Kenny Bednarek and Josephus Lyles - went faster that year.
From then on, Knighton was destined to be wearing spikes, rather than shoulder pads.
But his decision to turn professional in January 2021, still aged just 16, was a big one. He could no longer compete for his school. He could no longer take up university scholarship offers. 
He was straying off a well-worn path to the top. There were murmurs that it was too much, too soon. Hubris fed by hype.
""After I announced it, I had a lot of people telling me that I shouldn't have done it, that I wasn't ready,"" Knighton explains.
I take it they are not saying that now? Knighton just smiles.
In June, the then 17-year-old became the youngest American man to make a United States Olympic athletics team in 57 years.
In Tokyo, five weeks later, he finished fourth in the 200m, one place outside the medals.
under-18 world record set by Bolt? Through the rounds and Olympic build-up, he beat it seven times over.
He's a bona-fide breakout star. This summer, another stage beckons, a home World Championships in Oregon. But if Knighton runs like he is in a hurry, he knows he has time on his side.
""In Tokyo, I was kinda upset that I had lost, but I just had to think about the big picture and the long run,"" added Knighton, who turned 18 in January.
""I get called young every day, I am going be 24 in 2028, that is in two more Olympics and still kind of young. I think about that all the time.
""That Tokyo experience is something no-one can ever take from you, I will always have that experience. I really try not to get caught up in the pressure.
""As I grow older I am going to get stronger and faster. I am not the perfect 200m runner, I am still learning as I run it.""
Knighton is still learning off the track as well. He is back in school, walking the corridors of Hillsborough High School in Tampa, Florida, brushing shoulders with current class-mates and former football team-mates. A little more money, a few free tracksuits, but still the same teenager.
""There were a lot of people wanting to take pictures with me at the start of the school year,"" he remembers. 
""I think I signed an autograph actually, it got that chaotic.
""It has calmed down now. Now everyone just walks past me just like, 'Hey, Erriyon'.
""In other schools in the area, people say to my class-mates 'you go to school with Erriyon', but for people in my school they see me every day, so it ain't nothing.""
won't be the only ones getting familiar with Knighton's fame over the next few years."	/sport/athletics/61045980
sports	World Cup 2022: Wales match beats England game in TV ratings	"More viewers watched Wales play their opening World Cup match than England play theirs, overnight ratings show.
An average UK audience of 7.4 million watched England play Iran on BBC One, according to ratings body Barb.
mpares with 9.4 million who watched Wales play the USA on ITV.
fference can be partly explained by the timings - the England match took place during office hours in the UK on Monday, while the Wales match took place in prime time evening hours.
BBC also drew attention to the large number of viewers who were watching the England match on iPlayer, figures which aren't fully reflected in Barb's terrestrial data. 
It is likely that a larger number of viewers than usual would have been watching on iPlayer during office hours, while away from their traditional TV sets at home.
While England took part in the last World Cup in 2018, the Wales match marked the nation's first in a World Cup for 64 years.
England beat Iran 6-2 on the first day of the tournament in Qatar, while Wales drew 1-1 with the USA.
Wales match also aired on Welsh-language broadcaster S4C, the audience of which is not included in the ITV figures. BBC News has asked S4C for their own audience data.
Gareth Bale said he had ""no doubts"" about taking the penalty which brought Wales their first World Cup goal since 1958.
USA had been heading for victory until Bale was fouled by Walker Zimmerman and stepped up to score the 82nd-minute penalty.

Connoisseurs will recall their last close encounter with a PM, back in July - that surreal session with Boris Johnson solemnly discussing his policies as his government disintegrated around him. Liz Truss didn't last long enough to get a gig at the Liaison Committee, and this will be Rishi Sunak's debut before it. 
Commons: (14:30) Home Office Questions start the week, after which Labour's Andrew Western will take his seat having won the Stretford and Urmston by-election.
main debate will be the second reading of the Seafarers' Wages Bill - a measure to ensure that seafarers working out of UK ports are paid the national minimum wage while in UK waters. The bill is part of the government's response to the outrage caused when P&O Ferries sacked 800 staff without notice earlier this year. It has already cleared the Lords.

The petition attracted 18,496 signatures. 
Committees: Public Accounts (16:00) looks at the work of the Passport Office, including this summer's passport debacle when it was overwhelmed by post-Covid demand and thousands of people missed holidays and important travel for sickness and funerals. Top Home Office officials including Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft will give evidence. 
Lords: (14:30) The main event is the first of five days of committee scrutiny of the National Security Bill. This is the probing, shadow boxing phase of detailed debate, where amendments are not pushed to a vote, but the arguments tee up amendments at report stage in the new year. There's already a lot of chatter about several aspects of the legislation, including a proposed register of ""foreign influence"". 
One influential voice already asking questions is Lord Anderson of Ipswich, a former reviewer of anti-terror legislation.

health	Gloucester: NHS boss says people have died waiting for ambulances	"An NHS boss has said people have died while waiting in the community for an ambulance.
Delays in paramedics reaching patients is partly due to handover delays at hospitals, an ambulance trust said.
Chief executive of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Deborah Lee, said a decision had been made to ""bring the queue indoors"".
Some patients are being treated in corridors at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital to reduce handover delays.
Ms Lee said this was an extreme measure for extreme circumstances.
She told Gloucestershire's Health Overview Scrutiny Committee that it was safe to do this, but admitted it was not ""high quality care"" as ""nobody wants to be cared for in that setting"".
Ms Lee also admitted the situation was not sustainable but said handover times had improved and 90% were under an hour.
South Western Ambulance Service said it was working hard to reduce delays and working closely with partners to prevent them.
During the meeting at Shire Hall in Gloucester on Tuesday, councillors heard recruitment was a problem for Gloucester Royal Hospital.
Ms Lee said the NHS trust employed around 9,000 people but had a vacancy rate of 10%.
She said the trust had not given up on the ""goal of being fully recruited"" - but described urgent emergency care as the ""Achilles' heel"".
Gloucestershire's Police and Crime Commissioner Chris Nelson was at the meeting.
Mr Nelson said police officers were ""too often called out and then trapped"" at hospitals.
Det Supt Steve Bean said he had no problem helping the health service as a ""safety net"" - but said officers had been driving people to hospitals ""for months"".
Ms Lee said part of the problem at A&E was the number of patients ready to be discharged, blocking beds for new arrivals.
She said the Gloucester hospital had an average of 230 patients pending discharge.

health	Top hospitals targeted by nurse strikes	"A host of leading hospitals will be affected in next month's nurse strikes, the Royal College of Nursing says.
ude Great Ormond Street and Alder Hey children's hospitals and leading cancer centres.
Overall, around a quarter of hospitals and community services in England and nearly all those in Northern Ireland and Wales will see nurses walkout on 15 and 20 December.
Emergency care will continue to be provided during the strike action.
In total, 76 NHS organisations will see nurses walk out.
ude leading cancer centres the Royal Marsden and Liverpool's Clatterbridge centre alongside major hospitals in Birmingham, London, Liverpool, Newcastle and West Yorkshire.
All the health boards in Northern Ireland and all-but-one in Wales, the Aneurin Bevan, will see strike action take place.
But action has been suspended in Scotland after ministers there made a fresh pay offer, which the RCN is consulting on.
Meanwhile, Unison has announced ambulance staff including paramedics and call handlers, have voted to strike in five of England's 10 ambulance services. A walkout is expected before Christmas.
urnout was too low in the remainder for the votes to count, as well as in all but two of England's hospital and community trusts.
No services in Wales voted for strike action, but a walkout will happen across all services in Northern Ireland on 12 December, Unison said.
Overall, up to 100,000 nurses could be involved in the nurse walkout the RCN says, which would amount to about a quarter of nurses in those three nations.
RCN warned the government if a deal could not be agreed more services would be involved in the strike action next year.
RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: ""Ministers have declined my offer of formal pay negotiations and instead chosen strike action.
""It has left us with no choice. Nursing is standing up for the profession and their patients. 
""We've had enough of being taken for granted and being unable to provide the care patients deserve.""
Watch this video quiz to test your knowledge of nurses' pay
rike action will last from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT.
Under trade union laws, the RCN has to ensure life-preserving care
kely to mean some cancer services, urgent tests and scans and ongoing care for vulnerable patients will be protected alongside A&E and intensive care - although it will be up to local health bosses and union leaders to negotiate exact staffing levels on strike days.
But it seems almost certain the walkout will increase the backlog in non-urgent hospital treatment - a record seven million people are already on the waiting list in England.
GP services, however, will be unaffected as nurses working in practices were not entitled to take part in the ballot.
In England, the RCN only has mandates for strike action in just over half of NHS trusts as the turnout was too low in the rest.
For the forthcoming strikes the union's leadership has decided to only announce walkouts in around half of those eligible to take action.
RCN has called for a rise of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which currently stands at above 14%, but no UK nation has offered close to that.
In England and Wales, NHS staff, including nurses, have been given a rise of at least Â£1,400 - worth about 4% on average for nurses.
In Northern Ireland, nurses are yet to receive a pay award because there is no working government.
Earlier this month Scottish ministers made a fresh offer worth more than 8% for a newly-qualified nurse, with more senior nurses being offered less. This prompted the re-starting of talks.
During the ballot - the results of which were announced two weeks ago - the RCN had argued this year's below-inflation pay award came after years of squeezes on nurse's salaries. 
But England Health Secretary Steve Barclay has said the RCN's demands are not affordable.
He has said the government had met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in giving its award.
And it followed a 3% pay rise last year, in recognition of work during the pandemic, despite a public-sector pay freeze.
Welsh government said it was unable to enter pay talks without extra funding from the UK government.
will only be the second time RCN members have been on strike.
In 2019, nurses in Northern Ireland walked out over pay, while nurses who are members of Unison in England walked out in 2014 over pay.
A host of other major health unions, including Unison, the Royal College of Midwives, GMB and Unite, have all started balloting members."	/news/health-63799244

technology	UK decides AI still cannot patent inventions	"UK's Intellectual Property Office has decided artificial-intelligence systems cannot patent inventions for the time being.
Patents assign the ownership of a new invention to its creator.
A recent IPO consultation found many experts doubted AI was currently able to invent without human assistance.
Current law allowed humans to patent inventions made with AI assistance, the government said, despite ""misperceptions"" this was not the case.
Last year, the Court of Appeal ruled against Stephen Thaler, who had said his Dabus AI system should be recognised as the inventor in two patent applications, for:
judges sided, by a two-to-one majority, with the IPO, which had told him to list a real person as the inventor.
""Only a person can have rights - a machine cannot,"" wrote Lady Justice Laing in her judgement. 
""A patent is a statutory right and it can only be granted to a person.""
But the IPO also said it would ""need to understand how our IP system should protect AI-devised inventions in the future"" and committed to advancing international discussions, with a view to keeping the UK competitive.
In July 2021, in a case also brought by Mr Thaler, an Australian court decided AI systems could be recognised as inventors for patent purposes. 
Days earlier, South Africa had issued a similar ruling. 
However, the Australian decision was later overturned on appeal.
Many AI systems are trained on large amounts of data copied from the internet.
And, on Tuesday, the IPO also announced plans to change copyright law to allow anyone with lawful access - rather than only those conducting non-commercial research, as now - to do this, to ""promote the use of AI technology, and wider 'data mining' techniques, for the public good"".
Rights holders will still be able to control and charge for access to their works but no longer charge extra for the ability to mine them.
An increasing number of people are using AI tools such as DALL.E 2 to create images resembling a work of human art.
And Mr Thaler has recently sued the US Copyright Office over its refusal to recognise a software system as the ""author"" of an image, the Register reported.
In the consultation, the IPO noted the UK was one of only a handful of countries to protect computer-generated works with no human creator. 
""author"" of a ""computer-generated work"" is defined as ""the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken"", it says. 
And protection lasts for 50 years from when the work is made.
Performing-arts workers' union Equity had called for copyright law to be changed to protect actors' livelihoods from AI content such as ""deepfakes"", generated from images of their face or voice.
IPO took this issue seriously, it said, but ""at this stage, the impacts of AI technologies on performers remain unclear"".
""We will keep these issues under review,"" it added."	/news/technology-61896180
politics	What Conservative Party members think of net zero	"zero was a bone of contention at the Conservative Party conference this year.
Party members have differing views on how to achieve the emissions target by 2050.
One member said ""renewable energies"" were ""obviously the solution"" and that ""people do need to get used to not being as warm at home"".
Another argued the only way to ensure a reliable energy supply was to have ""either fossil fuels or nuclear""."	/news/uk-politics-63544735
technology	Emergency text averted possible California power cuts	"An emergency text message helped to prevent possible blackouts in the state of California on Tuesday. 
message asked residents to limit energy use for three hours to cut the risk of power cuts being implemented.  
California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO), said it ""saw an immediate and significant drop"" in the use of power after the text was sent. 
rt was issued after record temperatures put pressure on the state's electrical grid.
message, called a flex alert, was created by Cal-ISO to encourage users to conserve electricity when energy supply is at capacity. 
xts are sent out in advance so that preparations can be put in place. 
Some of the suggestions include setting thermostats to 25C (77F), and to avoid using kitchen appliances like ovens, kettles and microwaves. 
During hours of the alert, people are encouraged to pre-cool their homes and adjust blinds and drapes so that windows are covered.
Emma Hill, principal lecturer in energy and environmental management at Coventry University, said the messaging system appeared to have an impact. 
""There seems to be a correlation between the text being sent out and a reduction in demand for electricity,"" she said. 
She told the BBC that one of the reasons for this may be because people will not want potentially to be affected by power outages for longer periods of time.
""If you have very high demand in very high temperatures, when your electricity production is low, you risk damaging the equipment, like the transformers and the overhead lines, and they take time to repair,"" she said.
rt targeted 24 counties, which included Los Angeles and the Bay Area, because of high population and high air conditioning use. 
One Californian took to Twitter to explain the actions he took. 
Ms Hill believes that the UK is more resilient to situations like this.
""Ten years ago, UK network operators such as the National Grid and smaller disruption network operators had to assess the climate change risk to all of the systems.
""Due to that assessment, plans were made to manage that risk through damage management, communication or through improving the technology,"" she said. 
A National Grid Electricity System Operator spokesperson told the BBC: ""There are established mechanisms in place for communicating in an emergency.
""Due to the nature of these emergency communications and procedures we do not comment on the specifics of how these work."""	/news/technology-62832775
technology	Meta, Amazon, Twitter layoffs: 'Tech layoffs won't destroy American dreams of Indiansâ	"Many Indians who work on temporary visas in the US are facing an uncertain future after mass layoffs at big tech firms. Surbhi Gupta, who lost her job at Meta, tells her story of in her own words.
It was my mum's birthday. I was staying up late to wish her and that's when I started getting messages from my friends about layoff announcements. They were all anxious.
At around 6am here, I received an email that I'd been let go. I had joined Meta earlier this year as a product manager. My team was shocked because I'd been performing really well.
It went against my motto, work is worship, instilled early by my favourite teacher at school. Initially, it felt like the Titanic sinking because I was losing access to things one by one - workplace, then email, then laptop. But I was pleasantly overwhelmed and surprised in a positive way by my network on LinkedIn. Many colleagues, ex-colleagues and friends reached out in a very supportive way, making introductions and referrals. It made me feel like I have so many people in this country who care for me, made me feel like I belong to this country.
My last day at Meta is in January and my H1-B visa [a non-immigrant visa that allows firms in the US to hire foreigners for up to six years] allows me to stay in the US for another 60 days, so early March is the deadline for me to find another job. 
job search is going to be difficult now as hiring will be slow in December because of the holidays. But I'm very focused. I am in touch with multiple companies and exploring options.
What I'll miss most about Meta is the workplace and my colleagues. Being at Meta meant not only being able to build an amazing product for millions of people, but also being able to participate in fireside chats and growth and learning opportunities. As a product manager, it would have been rewarding to see the project I was working on go further.
My parents taught me to never give up in life. They tell me to stay strong because I'm a person who can convert problems into opportunities. They tell me 'aur kuch accha mil jayega' [you'll find something better].
But my ability to work and stay in the US depends on my H1-B visa. I moved to the US in 2009 and I have worked very hard to build my career on my own strength and intellect. I have worked in prominent companies like Tesla, Intuit, etc., built great products, got top ratings, paid taxes, and contributed to the US economy for more than 15 years, but I feel that I am in the same place as far as permanent residency goes because of the limitations of the H1-B. I was crowned Miss Bharat California [a beauty pageant] by my idol, Bollywood actress Sushmita Sen. I have walked the ramp at New York Fashion Week. I have my own podcast. 
We face unnecessary stress because the US has a country cap which takes forever for Indian H1-B holders to get a green card (permanent residency). Even though I am in the green card queue, when I track my status, I sometimes get a wait-time of two decades, and at other times, 60 years.
Our personal life suffers because of the uncertainty. Buying a home has been a question mark in my mind - do I invest in a home and then what if I have to leave. In spite of having gone ahead with the YC [Y Combinator is an American technology start-up accelerator], I can't start a company even though I have a great idea because I don't have a green card.
I travelled to 30 countries before turning 30 years old, but now I'm unable to travel much, even though it's my dream to travel the world, because I'm nervous about facing problems while trying to get my H1-B visa re-stamped. I have heard from my friends who work at great companies like Google and PayPal about getting stuck abroad.
I have even curtailed my travels home to India. A few years back, I got stuck in India. I had gone to attend a wedding and I had to get my H1-B visa stamped. But that took several months as it went into random administrative processing and I wasn't even sure when it would come through. The uncertainty and the wait caused problems in my marriage. The visa issues had a very big role in my marriage. It was not the only reason, but it became one of the major reasons for the break-up of my marriage. I also had to drop out of a semester at New York University, where I was studying at the time, because I didn't know when I would be able to return to the US. Why do people on H1-Bs have to deal with this?
I have not met my parents since the Covid-19 pandemic because they haven't been able to come to visit me for three-and-a-half years. They are elderly, and don't keep too well. I constantly think - if my parents need support, will I be able to go to help them? Nobody realises how it impacts our life.
But despite whatever has happened, I believe this experience too has a silver lining. Spirituality is a significant part of my life. I am a believer and follower of Sadhguru ji [as followers refer to Indian yoga guru Jaggi Vasudev]. He says that we should not be identified only by or limit our identity to our professional role. In Silicon Valley, the most frequently asked question is - Which company do you work for? But I am still me, not just a product manager. Everyone should realise that they are more than just the company they work for.

politics	Akshata Murty: Who is Rishi Sunak's wife?	"Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty is heiress to a fortune worth billions and has lived a life divided between three continents. BBC News has spoken to some of those she has rubbed shoulders with along the way. 
It is a Friday night in rural Yorkshire and local farmers and small business owners are waiting for the results of a Conservative party fundraising raffle. 
At the front of the room, one of the richest women in the country and her husband are drawing paper tickets and presenting the relatively modest prizes - a bottle of Campari, a coffee shop voucher. 
Akshata Murty had spent much of her life in the US and India, where her father founded one of the nation's biggest companies. But in recent years, she is just as likely to have been spotted at a local Tory social event, working the room alongside her husband Rishi Sunak in his North Yorkshire constituency.
""She mixes with everybody and everybody speaks highly of her,"" said Peter Walker, a local party member in Richmond. Despite her privileged background, ""there is no ostentatiousness,"" said Mr Walker, who last saw Ms Murty joining in with a Christmas carol service. 
Mr Walker, a retired deputy chief constable, said that for a long time he had been unaware of the scale of the couple's wealth. ""I literally got my knowledge of their significant wealth from the news,"" he said.
Ms Murty's shares in Infosys, the company her father founded, are worth an estimated Â£700m. 
Earlier this year, while her husband led the nation's financial affairs as chancellor of the exchequer, her business interests were the subject of newspaper headlines and political debate.
First, it emerged the company had continued operating in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. Then, days later, it was revealed she held non-domiciled status, meaning she did not have to pay tax on earnings from outside the UK. The company later pulled out of Russia, and Ms Murty pledged to pay UK tax on all her income, but said at the time: ""India remains the country of my birth, citizenship, parents' home and place of domicile.""
roversies have come as a surprise to some in India, where the family are known for promoting an austere lifestyle. 
""There is so much simplicity in the way they behave and the way they live, this is in their DNA,"" said Suhel Seth, an Indian marketing expert who knows the family.
In 1981, a year after his only daughter's birth, software engineer NR Narayana Murthy (unlike his wife and children, he spells his name with an ""h"") started an IT company, using $250 dollars borrowed from his wife.
Over four decades, as personal computing and the internet changed the world, the firm morphed into an outsourcing giant. Today, more than 300,000 employees work in about 50 countries. It has won lucrative contracts to provide IT services for companies and governments around the world, including in the UK. 
But it has faced controversies over its outsourcing practices. In 2013, the company paid $34m (Â£21m) to settle a civil lawsuit from the US government over allegations it misused visas. Infosys said at the time that claims of systemic visa fraud were ""untrue and are assertions that remain unproven"". 
In 2019, it agreed to an $800,000 settlement with California's attorney general over allegations 500 employees had the wrong visas. Infosys denied any wrongdoing. 
mpany's success has made Mr Murthy one of the richest people in a country where hundreds of millions live in poverty. But he has strived not to be part of a pampered elite, his supporters say.  
""He is corporate India's Mahatma Gandhi,"" Mr Seth said. ""He is unmoved by all these trappings.""
76-year-old is now retired, but even while leading a multinational corporation, he has said he made a point of cleaning his own toilet.  It was a habit learnt from his father, who was opposed to the Indian caste system, in which the ""so-called lowest class... is a set of people who clean toilets,"" he told the BBC in 2011. He continued the practice to set an example for his offspring, he said. 
It was one of a number of steps - including not having a TV in the house - that were intended to teach the children about the ""importance of simplicity and austerity"", Ms Murty's father wrote in an open letter to his daughter published in 2013. 
But it was her mother who shouldered the ""great responsibility"" of instilling family values in Ms Murty and her brother Rohan, he said.
Sudha Murty worked as an engineer in the 1980s, but gave up to teach in a college and spend more time with her children. In 1996, she started the Infosys Foundation - a non-profit organisation that funds educational and anti-poverty projects. Her passion for engineering and education is shared by her daughter. 
While living in California in 2007, Ms Murty joined the board of San Francisco's Exploratorium museum, which aims to engage young people in science and technology. The foundation's director at the time, Dennis Bartels, says she had a ""fervent belief"" in the power of Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to change lives. 
She had been ""especially supportive of programmes that increased the number of female engineers"", he says. 
He describes Ms Murty as having a ""gentle and generous spirit"".
As an undergraduate, she moved to the US to study economics and French at the private liberal Claremont McKenna College, near Los Angeles in California. She then earned a diploma at a fashion college before working at Deloitte and Unilever and studying for an MBA at Stanford University.
Her relationship with Mr Sunak began at the university's grand campus near San Francisco. The couple graduated 16 years ago, but have maintained a connection to Stanford, funding a fellowship for social entrepreneurs and keeping in touch with university staff.
""They are the same two lovely people they were as students - open and kind and humble and remarkably self-effacing,"" said Derrick Bolton, who was assistant dean of admissions during their time at Stanford. 
In 2009, they married in a ceremony in the bride's home city of Bangalore, later hosting a wedding party in New York.
""I remember Akshata just kind of gliding through the room and how incredibly beautiful she looked,"" said Mr Bolton, who joined the US celebration. 
""There were a lot of really important people in the room, and I'm not one of those important people, and Akshata still made time to come by and say hello and to let me know how happy they were that I had made it.""
In the years after graduation, the couple built a life in Santa Monica, California, where they still own a penthouse apartment with ocean views. For two years, she worked for venture capital company Tendris, but quit in 2009 to start a fashion label, named Akshata Designs. 
It was the culmination of a life-long love of fashion, which had baffled her ""no-nonsense engineer"" mother, Ms Murty told Vogue India in 2011. The company's website said it aimed to provide a ""sustainable source of income"" for female artists and craftspeople in rural India. However, the Guardian reported that the business collapsed within three years.
Around this time, Ms Murty and Mr Sunak founded a London-based offshoot of her family's investment fund, Catamaran Ventures. 
Within two years, Mr Sunak was elected as the MP for Richmond in North Yorkshire, having transferred his share of the company to his wife in the weeks before the vote in May 2015. It is a solid Tory seat that used to be held by ex-Tory leader William Hague.
ught a Grade II-listed manor house in the village of Kirby Sigston, near Northallerton, which sold for Â£1.5m in 2015. The couple have hosted Conservative party fundraising evenings with canapes served alongside the property's lake. 
It is one of four properties they are believed to own, including a four-bedroom mews house in London, where the couple have lived with their two daughters. Now, the family are set to move into 10 Downing Street. 
uple appeared on the Sunday Times' Rich List in 2022, with an estimated wealth of Â£730m. 
It has led to questions about whether Mr Sunak is out of touch, particularly during a cost-of-living crisis, and the couple's lifestyle has regularly made headlines. 
fter her husband resigned as chancellor in July, Ms Murty delivered tea and biscuits to journalists waiting outside their London home. But her hospitality was scrutinised after Twitter users suggested the designer mugs cost more than Â£30 each. One wrote: ""The price of that mug could feed a family for 2 days."" 
Speaking from Goa in India this week, Mr Seth said the episode was symbolic of what he sees as the unfair treatment of Ms Murty. ""People need to evaluate her value system, and not value her wealth,"" he said. 
He said Ms Murty was ""very charming, very simple and very bright"", adding that she had a ""sterling academic career"" before launching a fashion business ""far away from IT"". 
""If someone has done all of this and you just paper it over by saying 'you are just a rich kid', you are denigrating academia, you are denigrating values, you are denigrating a path of simplicity that the family has treaded on all their lives.""
In the towns and villages of North Yorkshire, the couple's affluence seems to receive less of a focus, even from political opponents. 
Labour councillor Gerald Ramsden said that while he ""completely disagrees"" with Mr Sunak's politics, he admits he is ""fairly well liked by the community"". He pointed to the fact that he had bumped into the family shopping for a barbecue in the local Tesco this summer. ""If I could afford a chef, I wouldn't be going shopping,"" he said.
It is a sentiment shared by independent councillor Paul Atkin. He said Mr Sunak had been ""extremely helpful"" on local issues, adding: ""It really doesn't bother me as to his wife's position"".
By their supporters, like Mr Walker, the former deputy chief constable, the couple are described as ""nice, ordinary folk"". 
""If you've got airs and graces, they won't last long in rural North Yorkshire in a farming community like this,"" he said.

health	South Western Ambulance Service declares critical incident	"South Western Ambulance Service has declared a critical incident after having 700 calls waiting to be dispatched on Tuesday.
rvice will take various measures, such as cancelling staff training, to address demand, according to BBC West health correspondent Matthew Hill. 
It comes on the eve of the first ambulance strike in over 30 years ago set for Wednesday, 21 December.
usands of staff are taking action in a dispute over pay and staffing levels.
BBC understands even at the busiest times pre-pandemic the service would be used to half the number of calls it received on Tuesday.
People have already been urged to only call 999 in life-threatening emergencies ahead of the strike action. 
Staff will leave the picket line for emergencies, union Unison said.
A government minister said if people need an ambulance they ""should most definitely seek that in the usual way"". 
m Pursglove, a minister for disabled people, health and work, said it was ""absolutely essential"" that ministers continue to engage with the unions. 
""But also that the NHS works tirelessly in local areas to make sure that the right cover is in place,"" he added.
government has said that about 1,200 members of the military and 1,000 civil servants will be drafted in to cover for striking ambulance and Border Force staff over Christmas.
Speaking ahead of Wednesday's strike action, Will Warrender, chief executive at the service, said they were ""sorry"" for any delays in response times.
""The public can help us by only calling 999 for life-threatening emergencies, we absolutely must have crews available for the most life-threatening conditions and we will be prioritising these patients,"" he added.
He asked people not to call back asking for an estimated time of arrival of an ambulance and said that if a patient's condition is not life-threatening they may be directed to alternative services.
Mr Warrender spoke as the service said there were 420 patients waiting for ambulances across the area on Monday, with 152 ambulances outside hospitals waiting to handover patients.
Kevin Stephens, from Gloucestershire, waited for more than 15 hours with his mother for an ambulance after her GP said she might have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and needed to go to hospital. 
Speaking to BBC West, he said: ""She is housebound so we couldn't drive her there or take a taxi. 
""When we got there they found she had a blood and urine infection - she wasn't able to have a scan for the DVT because the equipment wasn't working.""
She later spent the a night on a reclining chair because there was not a bed available before she was transferred to a ward, he said.
Mr Stephens said he had ""mixed emotions"" about the strike because he is ""very worried"" about his mother but is also ""very angry about the state the health care system is in"". 
""I don't blame the NHS workers for this,"" he said.
""Thousands of people up and down the country are really suffering. Our NHS is broken and it needs to be fixed.""
As well as planned strike action, cold weather and busy hospitals are putting increasing pressure on the service, the ambulance service said.
Chris Hewett, from Unison, said there were ambulance stations are spread out across the South West and ""we're confident that our Unison members who are on the picket line will want to respond to any emergencies in their local communities"".

health	Urology inquiry: O'Brien triage failures 'led to 24 red-flag referrals'	"Failure to triage almost 800 urology referrals in the Southern Health Trust led to 24 patients being upgraded to red flag referrals, an inquiry has heard.   
It emerged during the third day of a public inquiry into work of consultant urologist Aidan O'Brien at the trust.
A further five people received a late cancer diagnosis due to the failures.
Mr O'Brien previously claimed the trust provided an ""unsafe"" service and was trying to shift blame on to its medics.
former urologist told an investigation that between 2015 and 2016 he ""didn't have the time to triage"" and that he was ""surprised that the number of cases upgraded was so small"". 
quiry also heard that Mr O'Brien's private patients were given ""advantageous"" treatment over health service patients. 
On Thursday, the barrister representing the trust said it apologised ""sincerely, unequivocally and publicly"" to affected patients and their families, the public as well as health staff who ""work beyond the call of duty"" every day.
""The trust wishes to state in respect of any cases where harm has occurred that ought to have been avoided, its clear commitment to meeting any resultant claims,"" he said.
Dr Neda Chada, who was appointed by the trust to conduct an investigation into the consultant's work, found that 11 private patients under Mr O'Brien's care had completed their procedures within ""much shorter timeframes"" than expected for NHS patients given their clinical priority.
Another doctor, who carried out an additional review, also found there was ""no clinical justification"" to support nine out of the 11 patients' treatment within such a short time frame.
quiry heard that Mr O'Brien disputed the treatment dates and rejected the suggestion that he had been ""improperly advantaging private patients"".
But after reviewing the notes, Dr Chada concluded all nine private patients had ""each been scheduled earlier than their clinical needs dictated"".
She also concluded Mr O'Brien had afforded them advantages over health service patients with the same clinical priority. 
On Thursday afternoon, Gerard Boyle KC, counsel for Mr O'Brien, said the inquiry should consider why the urology service had been so seriously under-resourced for decades and why the trust did not obtain and supply additional support.
He asked if anything had improved since Mr O'Brien left the employment of the Southern Trust.
""If improvements have now been made, why did that not happen sooner, many, many, many years ago?"" he added.
""Mr O'Brien, as you know, has attended each day of the patient hearings to listen to the accounts that the patients and their families have given in relation to the circumstances that you are considering.
""His focus throughout his entire professional life has been to do his best for all of his patients, notwithstanding the circumstances.
""He fully and frankly acknowledges the difficulties and the concerns that have been raised in the context of the investigation so far and this inquiry.""
Earlier, counsel for the inquiry, Martin Wolfe KC, said the trust's investigation also found that the storage of 307 sets of patient notes at the consultant's home was ""excessive and outside normal acceptable practice"".
Mr Wolfe added it constituted a ""serious data protection information governance risk"" for the trust.
Mr O'Brien had told the investigation that the trust had ""not developed a system for either tracking notes or had they sought to determine the extent of the problem prior to the investigation"". 
quiry also heard of a catalogue of problems including undictated clinic notes dating back to November 2014 which affected 668 patients.  
A review look back took six months to complete. 
re had been ""multiple attendances"" without reciprocal letters on patient's files, delays in sending letters to patients and cases in which no entries had been made on patients' charts.  
Additionally, Mr Wolfe said that the inquiry may have to consider along various lines which senior managers within the trust knew what and when.  
In her investigation, Dr Chada found that there were ""earlier opportunities"" where those within the health trust could have added concern about Mr O'Brien's work prior to 2016.
rtunities were not taken in a consistent, planned or robust manner, she added.
On Wednesday, the inquiry heard that Mr O'Brien had left a 6.5cm swab in a patient after surgery and failed to identify it in a scan three months later.
It was also told that almost 600 patients received ""suboptimal care"" from Mr O'Brien's clinical practice."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63582741
business	Anti-London policies will slow UK's financial recovery, report says	"Divisive ""them and us"" rhetoric about London and the rest of the UK will hinder national recovery from the cost-of-living crisis, according to a new report.
Centre for London says there is an opportunity for less antagonism and more partnership with ""levelling up"" likely to fade as a political slogan.
k tank argues investment outside of London should not come at the expense of the capital.
report, London's Contribution in the UK, concluded regional inequalities could be fixed by increasing overall spending, rather than cutting London's funding. Choking off government spending in the capital would hit the tax revenues on which investment around the UK depends, it said.
k tank carried out focus groups involving 2,000 people from London and elsewhere to find out how people feel about London's dominant status as the country's only ""global"" city.
On the whole, it found people outside London did not resent the capital. However, they were not convinced by arguments about the value of the City financial sector to the UK economy, in terms of tax revenue.
And participants in the focus groups did appreciate London's international reputation and its importance for tourism.
Centre for London analysis describes the impact of ""London-plus"" tourism, where London is the ""gateway"" to visitors but the benefits are spread far beyond.
Researchers found 71% of first-time holiday visitors to the UK came to the city. 
""This London-plus tourism is estimated to contribute more than Â£640m in spending a year, driven by the fact that these visitors spend between 24% and 64% more nights in the UK than those who just visit one location,"" the report said.
Indeed, in 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic, London was visited by nearly 22 million tourists - around 63% of the total number who visited England and more than 53% of those who visited the UK.
gether, they spent nearly Â£16bn in the capital, accounting for 55% of tourism spending in the UK.
r spending supported one in seven of all jobs in London, 700,000 of them, and nearly 12% of the city's economic output, according to researchers.
report also found London's arts and cultural attractions were a major draw for domestic and international visitors. 
However, this is at risk, due the recently announced cuts to Arts Council funding, which have raised doubts about the future of institutions like the English National Opera. Under the plans, Â£24m of annual funding will be diverted outside of the capital.
Researchers also believe many Londoners are unable to access the city's wealth of cultural venues, and that cuts to public funding would make them less accessible still, particularly to low income families.
According to the report, the capital ""kickstarts"" innovations in public transport such as contactless payment, helping to make London fundamental to the UK's productivity and creativity.
And the report said Transport for London had entered into a private-sector partnership that allowed other cities to adapt its systems for their own network.
Former prime minister Boris Johnson made ""levelling up"" a key slogan of his premiership, although there was little consensus of what it meant.
With the future of levelling up unclear because of the recent political ""chaos"", Centre for London argues the strategy should focus on increasing overall investment spending, not cutting investment in London.
Claire Harding, research director, said: ""Levelling up could help everyone in the UK, but only if it is done properly. It must not be seen as an opportunity to create divisions between places or simply reduce London's funding, which is not a strategy that the public want and would only threaten the economy. 
""London's contribution has always been vital to the UK, ranging from a hub of world-class education, research and arts, to a place of pride representing the country on the global stage. We hope this report will convince policymakers to continue making the case for the city.""

health	East Midlands Ambulance Service faces unprecedented demand - director	"An ambulance service has experienced ""unprecedented"" demand this year, a director said.
East Midlands Ambulance Service has been preparing for winter by hiring additional call handlers and bringing in new ambulances.
Divisional director for Northamptonshire, Mick Jones, said he had ""never seen such demand"" in his 35 years at the service.
He said the past year had been ""exceptionally busy"".
rvice, which covers Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and Rutland, would usually see a reduction in demand in the summer, but that had not been the case this year, Mr Jones said.
""Staff have shown their resilience,"" he said.
""This winter really is more important than ever.""
rough the busier winter months, the service is receiving 110 new ambulances to replace older vehicles, with 24 of those based in Northamptonshire.
Mr Jones said the service was aiming for its fleet to have an average age of three years.
""It means it's a nicer place to work in for our staff, more comfortable for our patients and more reliable,"" he said.
In Northamptonshire, there would also be two welfare vehicles for staff which would provide hot drinks and a place to have a break during their shifts.
Mr Jones said in the past few weeks there had been a ""large improvement"" in the time it takes for crews to be released when handing patients over to hospitals.
""We don't have an infinite supply of resources so it's really important our crews are released so they can respond to other calls,"" he said.
Mr Jones said the service spends a lot of time preparing for the increased demand during the winter months.
""With the plans we have put in place and with the excellent staff we have, I think we should be OK,"" he said.

health	NHS ambulance trust lost 12k hours to handover delays in one week	"An ambulance trust says more than 12,000 hours were lost in handover delays in one week.
South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SWASFT) said the figure from September was the ""highest level of resource hours lost in a single week"" in its history.
In 2020, the trust was losing less than 500 hours-a-week to handover delays.
SWASFT has now released plans which aim to ""significantly"" reduce delays as some waiting times begin to come down.
A spokesperson for the trust said its staff ""strive every day to give their best"" but its performance had not returned to pre-pandemic levels, partly due to handover delays at emergency departments. 
""We are working with our partners in the NHS and social care, to do all we can to improve the service that patients receive,"" they added.
report, published by the trust on Thursday, comes as thousands of ambulance workers across England and Wales are set to go on strike on Wednesday in a dispute about pay.
In 2020, SWASFT was able to deliver Category 2 mean response times of less than 30 minutes. 
Category 2 two calls are judged ""urgent"" and the mean response target is 18 minutes for all trusts.
But in the week commencing 26 September, the response times to these calls was almost two hours.
rust said there was a ""close correlation between ambulance hours lost and response times"".
SWASFT - which serves 5.5 million people - said there had been ""some improvements seen across October and November in comparison to the peak position seen at the end of September"".
In a bid to improve on this, the trust's commissioners have shared steps to reduce the weekly time lost to handover delays to around 2,600 hours a week by March 2023.
would ""still be significantly higher than historic levels, but a substantial improvement on the current position,"" the report said.
Areas that have already improved include Gloucestershire, which has seen mean Category 2 response times on certain days fall close to 25 minutes, compared to over an hour at their peak.
rust said it was ""placing more ambulances on the road than ever before"".
It is also recruiting for call takers for its emergency operation centres and is ""continuing to work hard on triage to reduce the number of patients we take to hospital,"" the trust said.

sports	Mark Allen opens up on declaring himself bankrupt	"Northern Ireland's Mark Allen has spoken frankly about the reasons which led him to declare himself bankrupt.
36-year-old says he hopes the worst of his personal and financial problems are now behind him but concedes that he made ""some wrong moves"" in the past.
""I just overspent in every aspect of my life,"" said Allen, who declared himself bankrupt in January 2021.
""Bankruptcy was the only choice. It's easy to read that I made Â£3.5m on the table, but I spent it as fast it was coming in.""
Speaking to BBC Sport Northern Ireland, Allen, who has also gone through a costly divorce, described how he got himself ""into such a hole"".
""It was sad saying that given what I've made in the game and how well I've done. It's embarrassing, but the priority now is to get my life in order,"" he said.
""I didn't put any aside for a rainy day and if I was having a bad season I was still spending as if I was having a good season. 
""You don't put enough away for tax and everything just snowballs. All the legal stuff with the divorce, if you have to pay for lawyers and barristers, it all mounts up.
""If I could go back I would be more sensible with money. If there was a car available at Â£50,000 I bought one at Â£80,000. If there was a house available at Â£1,500 per month, I'd spend one at Â£2,500.
""Everything just snowballed. I'm currently in rented accommodation. It's a bit embarrassing to say as number 10 in the world.
""I'm on guaranteed earnings going forward now and that takes away the risk of having a good season or bad.""
Allen recently reached the British Open final in Milton Keynes, beating Judd Trump and Mark Selby in the process, before suffering an agonising 10-7 defeat to Welshman Ryan Day in the final at the Marshall Arena.
One of the main talking points of the ranking tournament was the former World Championship semi-finalist Allen's huge weight loss, which saw him shed almost five stone in the four months from last season.
""I had conversations with my partner Aideen and just said that I wasn't feeling good in myself,"" said Allen. ""I felt heavy, not healthy when I was playing snooker.
""One of my friends said he worried about me getting too big, too unhealthy, and said if you keep going the way you are going, then you're not going to be able to walk your daughter down the aisle.
""It was harsh but exactly what I needed to hear. Literally two days later I started eating better and instantly changing everything. 
""The first six to eight weeks were really hard as it involved a total change when it came to eating.
""There were times last year when given my size I was uncomfortable on some of my shots, I couldn't reach certain shots and, because I play at a fast pace, I could feel it on my breathing. It should help my game.""
Allen will begin the defence of the Northern Ireland Open title he won last year at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Sunday, 12 months after he was crowned champion during the height of his personal difficulties.
""It will be different going there with a different kind of pressure,"" he said.
""I am usually a bundle of nerves because I want to do well for other people rather than myself, as is the case at other tournaments,"" said the former Masters and Champion of Champions winner.
""That pressure should be gone now and I should have nothing to prove to the people of Northern Ireland that I can play. 
""I just want to go there and enjoy the experience of being defending champion, hopefully that will take the pressure off and I can do well.
""It [the tournament win] came out of the blue last year because I wasn't in a good place. It wasn't a nice time. 
""I don't know where Belfast came from as I was going through a dark time. It was just a really trying time."""	/sport/snooker/63216744
politics	Scottish government back in court over definition of 'woman'	"A campaign group has taken the Scottish government back to court over its definition of ""woman"" in legislation promoting gender balance on boards.
A judge ruled in February that ministers should not have ""conflated"" women and trans people in the bill, as they have separate protections in law.
But the For Women Scotland group is not happy with how the government revised the bill following the ruling.
Lady Haldane will preside over two days of arguments at the Court of Session.
Scottish government wants the case dismissed, arguing that its legislation is now in line with the terms of the 2004 Gender Recognition Act.
res on the Gender Representation on Public Boards Act, which was passed by MSPs in 2018.
gislation, which aims to ensure gender balance on public boards, originally stated that it included people who were living as a woman and who either had gone through or intended to go through the gender recognition process.
For Women Scotland contended that ministers had broken with the separate definitions of women and trans women laid out in the 2010 Equality Act - and had thus acted beyond their powers.
group lost an initial judicial review in 2021, but were successful on appeal.
Lady Dorrian ruled that by incorporating trans people who were living as women into the definition of woman, the bill ""conflates and confuses two separate and distinct protected characteristics"".
Because the bill singled out trans people living as women, the judge said it sought to apply to ""only some of those with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment"".
Her judgement also stressed that the case was about ""interpreting the law in relation to the legislative competence of the Scottish parliament"", and not transgender rights - ""a separate policy issue entirely"".
Scottish government responded by revising the guidance that accompanies the legislation, to stress that it covers women as defined by the Equality Act - but also trans people as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act (GRA).
guidance quotes directly from the 2004 Act, and reads: ""Where a full gender recognition certificate has been issued to a person that their acquired gender is female, the person's sex is that of a woman. And where a full gender recognition certificate has been issued to a person that their acquired gender is male, the person's sex becomes that of a man.""
government's written argument for the case says the GRA is ""unambiguous"" that a certificate provides for a change of sex, and  that ""there is nothing in the 2010 Act which takes away from the fundamental proposition"" of the 2004 Act.
For Women Scotland argue that the guidance still does not comply with the court's ruling, and that by making reference to sex the government was ""still confusing the protected characteristics and are trying to redefine 'woman' yet again"".
group's lawyer Aidan O'Neill KC argued that obtaining a gender recognition certificate should not ""result in a change of sex for the purposes of the Equality Act"".
He said if it did, it would ""run a coach and horses through the preservation of safe spaces for women and single-sex provision for women under the Equality Act"".
roceedings are taking place at the same time as MSPs are considering separate legislation which would make it easier for trans people to obtain a gender recognition certificate.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison told MSPs there would be ""no change to the protections under the Equality Act"", adding: ""Helping one group to better access their rights does not mean diluting or diminishing the rights of another group.""
Asked about the judicial review, the minister said she was ""not going to comment on a live court case""."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63568047
entertainment	University of Exeter student nurses put on art exhibition	"Student nurses have been producing original art to explore the emotional experience of nursing.
Undergraduates from the University of Exeter's Academy of Nursing have produced paintings, poetry, collages and sculptures.
All the work will go on show at an exhibition - The Art and History of Nursing - at St Luke's campus.
university said it was helping students to understand experiences ""of health, illness and caring for others"".
xhibition is based on a new course module for third-year students that brings together literature, historical information and art related to nursing.
Student Kirsty Cracknell has produced an acrylic painting depicting the transition of a terminally ill patient from clinical to palliative care, through the imagery of a horse riding through two worlds.
She said: ""I'm excited to be part of the exhibition and the module. It's a great chance to explore the inner worlds of our patients using keen observation and contemplation.
""My hope is that it encourages people in our professional practice to consider using art as a reflective tool when caring for our patients.""
Marie Clancy, senior lecturer at the Academy of Nursing, said: ""I hope when visitors come to our exhibition, they realise how hard we work in caring for our patients.
""Enhancing the compassionate and holistic care offered to patients is our motivation for pushing our student nurses to think outside the box in considering different perspectives of health and caring.""
xhibition will be held on Wednesday 14 December at Baring Court on the St Luke's Campus between 10:00 and 12:00 GMT.

business	Risk of Â£50bn bond sale sparked emergency Bank of England move	"ftermath of the mini-budget could have seen a Â£50bn fire sale of UK government bonds by funds connected to the pensions industry, the Bank of England has said.
re was risk of a downward ""spiral"", it said, as increases in the cost of government borrowing hit the funds.
Bank feared these funds would be forced to sell their government debt holdings, adding to the market turmoil.
f borrowing saw record increases for two days, the Bank said.
rise in borrowing costs over four days was ""three times larger than any other historical move"".
Bank stepped in to calm markets last week following fears that some types of pension funds were at risk of collapse. 
It pledged to buy up to Â£65bn of government bonds after the mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets and the pound plunged.
Investors had demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to halve in value.
Bank said that the market in long-term loans to the government lasting three decades, known as 30-year gilts, saw two days where the effective cost of borrowing saw record increases, on its data which starts in 2000. 
A letter from the Bank's deputy governor John Cunliffe to the Treasury Select Committee contains a diagram depicting the trigger for the interest rate shock as the ""fiscal event"", another name for the mini-budget, and that the nature of the move in the UK was not seen in the US or eurozone.
Jonathan Haskell, a member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, also said in a speech on Thursday that ""there was undoubtedly a UK-specific factor"" in the market turmoil.
radicts the claims made by some government supporters that the mini-budget had nothing to do with last week's turmoil, which was instead caused by ""global factors"".
UK's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had offered to prepare a draft forecast in time for the mini-budget, but the government did not take this up.
Mr Haskell added that the Bank uses OBR data in its own forecasts, and a ""sidelined"" OBR ""generates more uncertainty by worsening everyone's information base"".
risk the Bank feared was that the funds connected to the pensions industry, known as Liability Driven Investments, would become forced sellers of their holdings of UK government debt, in an already troubled market.
A Â£50bn sale would represent four times the normal daily trade in the market, and would have pushed the effective cost of borrowing, or yield, even higher than 5%, leading to further problems. Before the mini-budget, this yield had stood at about 3.7%.
While individual defined benefit pension funds were not at risk, because they are guaranteed by the sponsoring company, it could have led to a wider financial stability challenge.
Bank of England decided to intervene in the market last Wednesday, bringing down the effective borrowing cost from over 5% to under 4%.
As the Bank has eased off its interventions, on Thursday these costs had risen notably again, as high as 4.4%. These rates feed into the costs of long-term mortgages and business lending.
Bank emergency intervention is due to end next week and it has so far bought a fraction of the government bonds it could have, spending just Â£3.7bn.
On Thursday, the Bank said it would wind down its bond buying in ""a smooth and orderly fashion"" once it felt the market was functioning normally again.
Bank also said it is working with the UK's pensions and financial regulators to make sure that that investment strategies used by certain types of pension schemes can withstand market volatility."	/news/business-63161404

technology	Rogers outage: Why a network upgrade pushed millions in Canada offline	"In early July, a massive network outage at Rogers, a Canadian telecoms giant, forced more than 10 million customers - over a quarter of the country's population - off their internet or wireless services. The firm is now under intense pressure from regulators to explain what happened.
quences of the 19-hour nationwide outage ranged from the potentially dangerous, to the frustrating, to the ironic.
Police services reported that 911 services were inaccessible on many mobile phones. Hospitals reported communications problems, and one Ontario hospital had to redirect cancer patients when emergency radiation treatments were affected by the outage.  
Banking services were disrupted, and many businesses could not accept debit payments or could only take cash.
Fans of pop superstar The Weeknd - who hails from Toronto - were turned away after he was forced to cancel a hometown tour stop at the Rogers Centre (yes, the same Rogers) stadium.
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) - the regulatory body that oversees Rogers and other Canadian telecoms  - couldn't receive calls.
mpany, one of Canada's main telecoms firms, is now facing intense scrutiny from the federal government and the CRTC, which has ordered Rogers to explain in detail what caused the ""unacceptable"" shutdown.
Rogers CEO Tony Staffieri blamed the system failure on a maintenance update and has apologised to customers, offering a five days service credit as compensation.
But questions remain about how a seemingly routine process left millions without crucial access to online services - and on Friday, a Parliamentary committee said it would be studying the outage in meetings this month.
Long before the outage, expressing frustration with Canada's telecoms industry has been described as a national pastime, uniting the country much like ice hockey and the ubiquitous Tim Hortons coffee chain.
""Rogers, Bell Canada and Telus are known as the companies that you love to hate,"" said Richard Leblanc, a professor of law, governance and ethics at York University in Toronto.
firms control 90% of the country's telecoms market.
""We're essentially beholden to three companies,"" said Mr Leblanc. ""They've got so much authority and control.""
Experts say it's a symptom of Canada's strict foreign ownership rules for the industry. 
government has, for years, supported industries like the airlines and the telecoms out of fear that foreign countries might take over, said Ben Klass, a PhD candidate at Carleton University's School of Journalism and Communication. 
""As the neighbour of the United States, Canada has got a bit of a complex. We want to ensure we don't just become a branch plant of the US.""
gopoly isn't cheap - Canadians also pay some of the highest mobile phone and roaming rates in the world, according to multiple studies.
Industry analysts say Canada's rather non-competitive telecoms market has allowed its Big Three - Rogers, Bell and Telus - to face few consequences for sometimes shoddy service.
In a statement, Mr Staffieri vowed Rogers ""will make every change and investment needed to help ensure that [a similar outage] will not happen again"" and would work with the industry to ensure certain essential services would not be interrupted by technical issues.
Bell's top executive, Mirko Bibic, said last week the company takes its role in Canadians' communications networks ""very seriously"" and was investing billions in upgrades for a ""robust and resilient"" infrastructure.
And telecoms firms have argued that Canada's large land mass and sparse population make it expensive for telecoms to provide service.
But Rogers in particular has had a rough time in recent months.
July's massive outage was the second in two years.
In April 2021, the company's wireless network crashed in a similar fashion, affecting calls, text messages and data services. At the time, Rogers blamed the failure on a software update by one of its equipment suppliers.
Months later, the company was hit with a public relations crisis as the family-owned business suffered a showdown between siblings, reminiscent of HBO television show Succession.
Edward Rogers - the namesake and only son of the late family patriarch - sought to unilaterally remove then-chief executive Joe Natale, blaming him for the firm's underperformance.
But Mr Rogers was stymied by his mother, Loretta, and two sisters, who closed ranks around Mr Natale, setting the stage for a very public family feud.
ute eventually made its way to court, where a judge sided with Mr Rogers. He went on to hand-pick Mr Staffieri, who is now the current CEO, saying he was among ""the most highly regarded and seasoned"" executives in the industry.
For Rogers, the timing of this outage blunder was particularly bad, as the company is working to close a proposed C$20bn ($15bn; Â£13bn) takeover of competitor Shaw Communications.
Mr Staffieri said this week that Rogers remains committed to the merger.
But Rogers still needs the approval of the Competition Bureau Canada - the national antitrust authority  - and the federal government.
And the massive outage raised doubts that the relevant authorities will opt to put more power in the hands of a single company.
""It certainly won't help their cause,"" said Mr Klass.
""Just the fact that this outage occurred on such a wide scale and it would have been worse had Rogers already taken Shaw over"", with an even larger customer base knocked offline.
As Canadians saw, the country's outsized reliance on just three telecoms firms make it susceptible to sweeping network crashes.
But experts say this reliance on a few firms also makes Canada vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
""We've put all our eggs in one basket, and that's now a target for threat actors - Russia, China, Iran, North Korea,"" said York University's Mr Leblanc.
""You don't have to attack financial services, or healthcare, or emergency services, you just have to attack the telco because all these industries are contingent on these two or three players,"" he said.
If a system failure could shut down the system for hours, hostile actors could do much more damage.
Rogers has until Friday to comply with the CRTC's demand for a detailed account of last week's failure.
Many industry experts have gone one step further, calling for a public probe into how this most recent outage occurred.
""This cannot happen behind closed doors,"" said Mr Leblanc. ""It needs to be a public inquiry, where the telcos are hauled in front of elected politicians. There needs to be accountability.""
For now Mr Leblanc, a long-time Rogers customer, has done the only thing he can do: call the competition.
""Someone is coming over on Saturday to install my internet,"" he said. ""I went with Bell."""	/news/world-us-canada-62174477
technology	Instagram debuts new age-verification tools in UK and EU	"Instagram has introduced technology to help verify the age of users in the UK and EU.
Anyone trying to edit their date of birth from that of an under-18 to that of an over-18 must verify their age.
But now, users have the option to record a video of themselves that will be analysed by age-estimation technology, instead of uploading ID.
Instagram said this would help ensure users' experiences on the platform were age appropriate.
In June, Instagram announced it was exploring ways for teenagers to verify their age and comply with platform rules.
And in a US trial, they were given three ways to verify they were over 18: 
Instagram says it already uses artificial intelligence and in-app reports to help determine whether users are under 18 and, indeed, under 13, its minimum age.
But according to research commissioned by UK media regulator Ofcom, one in three children lies about their age to access adult content on social media.
Instagram accounts for under-18s:
Instagram public policy director Tara Hopkins said video age verification was an ""important step"" in delivering safer and better experiences for teenagers on the platform. 
""We want everyone to experience Instagram in a way that's appropriate for their age, which means we need to know how old they are - and this is a challenge across our industry,"" she said.
Instagram already uses video selfies to verify the identity of users locked out of their account
It has now extended its partnership with UK digital identity provider Yoti to use them to verify age. 
Yoti's technology estimates age by analysing facial features.
On average, it says, it is accurate to within:
Meta, which owns Instagram, says the technology cannot identify anything about users except their age and it and Yoti will delete images once this has been done.
Platforms could face further requirements for verifying the age of younger users under government proposals for the Online Safety Bill, which ministers have said will return to Parliament as soon as possible. "	/news/technology-63544332
business	Cost of living: Renters search for tenancies with bills included	"Demand among tenants has jumped for properties where all the bills are included in the rent, according to Rightmove.
roperty website said inquiries for build-to-rent homes with bills included had risen by 36% over the past year.
Millions of people are facing rising domestic gas and electricity bills as the cost of living soars.
rospect of further rises will have increased demand for all-in rent.
Existing pressure on tenants' finances comes as the average monthly rent being advertised across Britain (excluding London) was a record Â£1,088 in the first three months of the year. That was an 11% annual increase, Rightmove said.
In London, average asking rents have increased by 14% annually to Â£2,195 per calendar month.
re are also more than triple the number of tenants inquiring as there are rental properties available, making the market highly competitive, according to the website.
Homes with balconies, communal gardens, properties allowing pets and those offering zero deposits were all popular, it said.
Nearly two-thirds (63%) of landlords told Rightmove they have kept rents the same for their tenants over the past year, with the remaining 37% saying they have increased their rents.
m Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data, said: ""A shortage of rental homes and strong demand for the properties available has led to a greater number of tenants choosing to renew their leases and stay put, rather than re-enter a competitive rental market.
""People who had been waiting to see what happened last year are now being faced with record rents and so are seeking out properties where they can have more certainty over their outgoings, with all bills included becoming increasingly sought after.
""Landlords may have been tempted to put their rents up given the high demand from new tenants, but many understand the affordability challenges of rising rents and bills, as our study shows that the majority are charging their tenants the same as a year ago.""
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said earlier in the week that 63% of property professionals expected rents to rise in the next three months, the highest proportion since its records started in 1999."	/news/business-61425947
entertainment	BTS: K-pop stars to take time out for military service	"world's biggest boy band BTS will be abandoning their fandom ""army"" to join the South Korean military for national service, their agents say.
firmation ends years of debate over whether the K-pop stars might be exempted from military duties.
In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18-28 must serve about two years.
BTS members had been allowed to put off starting their military service until they turned 30. The oldest, Jin, is currently 29.
He will begin preparations next month, the band's management revealed on Monday. All seven members of the group - the youngest of whom is 25 - also plan on following through with their service, it said.
South Korea retains compulsory military service mainly because the country is still technically at war with its nuclear-armed neighbour, North Korea.
reviously won a deferral - when in 2020, South Korea's parliament passed a bill allowing the biggest K-pop stars to delay their duties until the age of 30.
uncement by BTS comes just months after the band announced they would be taking a break, with some members pursuing individual projects.
K-pop group have been the world's best-selling artists for the past two years -  known for catchy, upbeat hits like Dynamite and Butter. They've also been praised for their advocacy on young people's mental health.
Viewed by many South Koreans as national treasures -  some lawmakers had suggested the band could be granted an exemption so they could keep performing. Such exemptions have been given to Olympic medallists and other high-achieving sports stars, classical musicians and dancers.
However, the statement from the band's managers on Monday said the musicians were content to carry out their duties. Jin - who had originally applied for his service start date to be delayed - had cancelled that request, their agency said.
uncement suggests the band would probably not get back together for at least a couple of years. 
""Both the company and the members of BTS are looking forward to reconvening as a group again around 2025 following their service commitment,"" said their management company in a statement.

""There would be a way to give them a chance to practice and perform together,"" said Lee Jong-sup."	/news/world-asia-63282589
health	Shrewsbury mother proud of new voice after rare cancer	"A woman who lost her voice box to a rare cancer says she is proud of her new one and urges others with the condition not to hide away.
Loren Stokes, from Shrewsbury, had her larynx, thyroid, saliva glands and part of her oesophagus removed to treat a tumour that had grown in her neck.
She now uses a voice prosthesis.
48-year-old dental nurse has been chosen to launch the fundraising campaign Stand Up To Cancer from Cancer Research UK and Channel 4.
Ms Stokes said had she not had the procedure, she would not be here.
She began treatment after being diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma in 2019.
She said she started to have neck and shoulder pain and then could not swallow properly before feeling a lump in her neck move during a doctor's examination.
She said it was ""shocking"" to see the size of the tumour that had grown inside her.
""When I went for my operation,"" she said, ""the consultant surgeon said we've got you at the right time because a couple more weeks it probably would have closed your windpipe off.""
roat cancer symptoms could manifest as asthma, chest or ear infections so it was not commonly picked up, she said.
After her operation she said she felt depressed and regretted having the procedure, but began to feel more positive.
At first she said she felt self-conscious about her new voice but she was now proud of it and encouraged others to be as well.
Ms Stokes talks by pressing a valve in her throat to control airflow. She had to learn how to take in a breath, push it to the bottom of her stomach and back out again.
In October 2020, a routine scan showed the cancer had returned in her lungs which currently was inoperable, but she said she remained positive.
""I just think whatever they can do, I'm grateful for and the time they can give me - they don't know how long I've got,"" she said.
Her 17-year-old son Kieran, who has autism, has been ""brilliant"", she says, after initially struggling with his mother's change.
She said: ""Cancer can affect anyone's life, at any time, so we really have no choice other than to unite against it and help support the scientists to keep making new discoveries.""

politics	David TC Davies: The ex-HGV driver in Sunak's cabinet	"After about three years as a junior Wales Office Minister the Monmouth Conservative MP David TC Davies has been promoted to the cabinet as Welsh secretary by the new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
But what do we know about Wales' new man around the UK cabinet table?
Let's get the TC thing out of the way first. 
It stands for Thomas Charles, after the Methodist clergyman (1755-1814) from Bala - now in Gwynedd - who played a key role in setting up Sunday schools.
When the Welsh MP entered the UK parliament in 2005 the speaker would call him to speak as David TC Davies, to distinguish him from the English Tory MP David Davis who went on to become Brexit secretary.
Some MPs dubbed him Top Cat, a reference to the classic 1960s American cartoon series whose lead character was known as TC to ""close friends"".
Born in 1970 and educated at Bassaleg Comprehensive School in Newport, David TC Davies's grandfather on his mother's side was a miner at Clipstone Colliery, in Nottinghamshire, who would joke he was the ""only Tory coal miner in the town"".
His father, Peter Davies, was a prominent Conservative Newport councillor, a popular, larger than life character who was a regular fixture on the Welsh media.
After school David TC Davies worked for British Steel and joined the Territorial Army, spending 18 months as a Gunner with 104 Air Defence Regiment at Raglan Barracks in Newport. 
A time abroad followed, including Australia, where his employment included spells as a nightclub promoter, tobacco picker and rickshaw driver.
Back in the UK he worked as a continental lorry driver and then managed the family haulage business.
David TC Davies MP: ""I've been threatened and called scum""
He came to prominence in Welsh political life 25 years ago, as a ""No"" campaigner against the creation of the Welsh assembly.
He was on the losing side in that 1997 referendum, which came just months after Tony Blair's Labour landslide general election victory, although the referendum vote was tight, 50.3% for and 49.7% against.
Mr Davies had established credentials as a devolution sceptic.
He ran for election to the assembly he had opposed two years later, winning the Monmouth seat. He became the only Tory representing a directly elected assembly constituency, rather than one of the regional top-up seats using a system of proportional representation that secured his party colleagues a berth in Cardiff Bay.
He soon dedicated himself to learning Welsh, impressing Welsh speakers in the fledgling institution with his determination to use the language at every opportunity, even if he mangled his words a little as he was getting to grips with it.
Mr Davies made the headlines when, during a debate in the assembly's first year, Labour member Alison Halford was accused of inappropriate behaviour for saying said he had ""one of the nicest bottoms I have seen for some considerable time"".
His response: ""The bottom line is that there are more serious things we could be talking about but on this occasion I'll turn the other cheek."" 
He was elected MP for Monmouth in 2005. During his political career he has got himself into hot water from time to time for controversial comments on sensitive subjects. 
In 2006, after his house was burgled while his family and visitors slept, he called for homeowners to be allowed to arm themselves with Taser stun guns.
wo years later he was slow-handclapped at a National Black Police Association (NBPA) conference when he said they should let white officers be full members and not doing so might be seen as racist.
NBPA said Mr Davies had been disrespectful, that it was made up of local associations and that some of them allow full white membership.
Mr Davies, a special constable at the time, had been invited by mistake, when the NBPA wanted to hear from ""the other"" David Davis, a former shadow home secretary. 
In 2013 he said his opposition to same sex marriage and support for a referendum on EU membership would put himself into the ""swivel eyed-loon, fruitcake"" category reported to have been described by someone close to Prime Minister David Cameron at the time.
In 2016 his call for child migrants arriving in the UK from Calais to have their teeth tested to verify their age was condemned by dentists.
He has also been an outspoken critic of transgender rights.
In 2018 he joined a Twitter conversation about the Labour Party's suspension of a member for posting a message that read: ""Trans women are men.""
He wrote: ""Somebody possessing a penis [and a] pair of testicles is definitely not a woman. This should be a biological fact not a matter for political debate.""
LGBT+ Conservatives group replied: ""David TC Davies' transphobic views are abhorrent and out of kilter with Conservative Party policy"".
reply also included a phrase which implied an offensive term against Mr Davies - something he said was ""abusive and misogynistic"", which the group later apologised for, promising to ""continue to debate with him vigorously on trans rights but in a mutually respectful way"".
Speaking on BBC Radio Cymru about his controversial opinions last year, he told Beti George: ""I don't want to cause offence to anyone. 
""But, at the same time, I think I, or others in politics, have the right to say things that are sometimes difficult to hear.""
He said he would not apologise for anything he had said in the past. 
Fellow Tories say he has calmed down over the years.
MP David Davies is a keen amateur boxer
He spent nine years chairing the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, worked as an assistant government whip and as a junior Wales Office minister before his promotion to the cabinet as Welsh secretary.
He showed his pragmatic side in 2018 when, as a dedicated Brexiteer, he urged fellow Tory Eurosceptics in the European Research Group to ""swallow their pride"" and back Theresa May's ""half-loaf Brexit"" deal or risk wrecking the whole project.
Amid the increasing levels of abuse aimed at politicians at the time he took to wearing a body camera in 2019 for ""protection and evidential purposes"".
Later that year he expressed frustration over MPs representing English seats being made Wales Office ministers, but was appointed to that deputy role in the department a few months later.
Outside politics, he married his long-term Hungarian girlfriend Aliz in 2003, they live in Monmouth and have three children.
He is a keen fitness enthusiast, attending the gym every day. 
As an amateur boxer he provided lively footage for TV coverage of a committee inquiry into prisons and how to steer young people away from offending by sparring with Joe Calzaghe and has fought charity matches as ""The Tory Tornado"".
Nearly two and a half decades after TC arrived in Cardiff Bay as one of the first Welsh assembly members, he has finally become Top Cat at the Wales Office with a seat at the UK cabinet table."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63399169
sports	Matt Dawson column: Steve Borthwick's England to-do list	"Steve Borthwick takes charge of England with 47 days until the start of the Six Nations and less than nine months until the start of the Rugby World Cup. There is little time to waste. 
re the five items at the top of his to-do list.
mmediate priority for Borthwick is to sort out the attacking heart of the team - the fly-half, inside and outside centre.
During the autumn, we saw Marcus Smith, Owen Farrell and Manu Tuilagi fill those positions. It was Eddie Jones' preferred combination, but we didn't see the cutting edge we all wanted.
If Borthwick is going to use his arrival for an honest assessment of where England are, then Farrell's place is under threat.
His form over the past three years has been nowhere near where it was before that. For all the leadership in training and setting of standards off the pitch, he has not been performing as he can.
Statistically there are better inside centres in the Premiership, ranging from the very experienced to the new. Could any of them build a relationship with Smith, allowing him to become the general of this England side?
Whatever the solution, time is short. Borthwick needs to be consistent in his selection through that area to build an understanding of each other's games and the team's gameplan collectively.
Regardless of his place in the team, I would be very surprised if Farrell continues as captain.
Relieving him of the press commitment and public scrutiny might free him up and help him find his game. 
And there are plenty of candidates, well known to Borthwick, to take it on.
When Borthwick picked Ellis Genge to succeed Tom Youngs as Leicester captain, it was seen by some as a surprise choice. But it paid off handsomely with Genge leading the Tigers to the Premiership.
Borthwick has seen Maro Itoje since the start. A teenage Itoje made his Saracens debut in Borthwick's final season as a player at the club.
Courtney Lawes has been a hugely successful England captain when he has played and has a different style to Farrell. Borthwick captained him for England and coached him for the Lions.
Could it be a left-field shout like Jamie George, who Borthwick has worked with extensively at Saracens and in his role as England's line-out guru?
Having a forward as a captain - as all the above are - can be an advantage with a front-row seat for the set-piece and the breakdown.
re is a twin challenge. The team have lacked a consistent method of breaking down the opposition for a number of years now. For me, Jones was too focused on the game's global comings and goings - what other teams were doing tactically, how the laws were being interpreted elsewhere
He was always trying to be one step ahead of the trends when he decided how England were going to play. 
You have to have an identity which is the core way of how you are going to play. You certainly need options around that to adapt to opposition, officials and conditions, but that bedrock has to be there.
England's best performances have come when they have taken games by the scruff of the neck, decided the tempo and run riot from the start.
Rugby World Cup semi-final win over New Zealand in 2019 under Jones - arguably the greatest game England have ever played - came from pinning back the All Blacks and forcing them to adapt and switch styles. 
rt is England need to have the decision-makers in the team and a chain of command that can be nimble and agile enough to find another way to win. 
ften, when South Africa, France or Scotland have produced something unexpected, England have been too sluggish to change styles.
I don't believe England are less strong or fit than the All Blacks or Springboks. I just don't believe it. But in the scrum they were shoved backwards in the final two matches of Jones' reign.
It isn't just the technical aspects of the set-piece, I think England are a tiny percentage off in mentality. Everyone is motivated to play for their country, but to get that thin margin of focus and desire that may be the difference. You need something more.
You have to wake up in the morning and get really excited about what you are doing day to day. Judging by some of the players' comments,external-link that hasn't always been the case.
It is fundamental for Steve. He clearly has done something special at Leicester, turning a team of also-rans into champions.
If he can recreate some of that environment with England, the players there are going to get a real shot in the arm to carry them into the Rugby World Cup.
f the easier ones, but the connection to England's fans at Twickenham needs to be re-established. The boos at the end of the autumn defeat by the Springboks showed that relationship had been damaged.
Borthwick is not going to be a front-and-centre ringmaster, doing the television interviews and dropping buzz words. That is not his style. But he will know that England need to be doing more in exciting fans with how they play on the pitch and engaging with them off it.
It will be a real benefit to his team. Twickenham, when it is full of 80,000 fans and rocking, is a really difficult place to come and play. 
At the end of the Jones era, teams fancied their chances of silencing the crowd and robbing England of momentum.

entertainment	The long struggle of Dumfries to get its cinema back	"When the Odeon in Dumfries closed its doors in 2018 it left a big hole in the entertainment offering.
It means the closest large-scale cinema to the town is actually in another country - over the border in Carlisle, more than 30 miles away.
A council-commissioned feasibility study has identified potential for a Â£10m multi-screen facility.
It is now being asked to commit a further Â£75,000 to develop the project aimed at boosting the town centre.
Martin O'Neill, creative director with The Stove Network arts and community group in the town, said the suggested five-screen, 433-seat facility could give a major lift.
""I think something like that for Dumfries extends the cultural offer beyond what we currently already have, which is fantastic, but perhaps not as mainstream as people would like,"" he said.
""To see anything major you would have to go to Carlisle or further afield to actually see the next Star Wars or what have you.
""I think, beyond that, something like this could support businesses and other enterprises and contribute - potentially fairly significantly - to the regeneration of Dumfries.
""It has the potential to really bring Dumfries into some new territory, into some new realm.""
He said the loss of the old Odeon had been something which was on the cards for some time.
""I think the cinema quietly passed away, I don't think it was a blow as such, I think it sort of faded out of people's way of life,"" he said.
He said that was an issue facing cinemas across the country.
""But I think what this type of cinema can do is bring back those experiences and memories,"" he added.
""If you are a Doonhamer of the last 10 years or more you will have a memory of being in that cinema - you learned Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's dad in that cinema.
""Everyone has that kind of experience at the cinema and to not have that currently feels like we are depriving ourselves a little bit.""
At present, the town has the 69-seat council film theatre at the Robert Burns Centre with a small multi-screen about 15 miles away in Annan or the larger sites in Carlisle.
re is also a ""pop-up"" cinema being offered by the Big Burns Supper.
Its chief executive, Graham Main, said there was no doubt there was an appetite for the big screen in the town.
""Interest in screenings at our pop-up cinema at the Loreburn Hall has been much higher than we anticipated, particularly around mainstream cinema releases,"" he said.
""Doonhamers like to get out and watch movies, there is no question about that.
""We have been pretty vocal about safeguarding culture in Dumfries in our 12-year history so we fully endorse this idea, in principle.""
He said it would be great to see a community group take the plan forward but pointed out that smaller operators often had to wait longer to get major titles.
""In practical terms, this means that Dumfries screenings would lag behind four to five weeks if a national operator didn't step forth and this doesn't feel good enough for our local community,"" he said.
Mr Main said whatever happened he hoped there would be some kind of interim solution offered until the ambitious multi-screen plan was delivered.
Otherwise, Dumfries will still have to wait a few more years before it gets to see the latest blockbusters on the big screen as soon as they are released. "	/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-63622975
sports	European Curling Championships: Bruce Mouat's Scots men eye 'history and revenge' in final	"Bruce Mouat says it is ""surreal"" to be on the brink of becoming the first Scottish skip to retain the European curling title since 2008. 
match David Murdoch's feat from 14 years ago, his rink will have to beat a Swiss team that inflicted the Scots' only round-robin stage defeat.
Win and Mouat will be champion for a third time in four years come Saturday.
""We are definitely looking for a bit of revenge after that round-robin game,"" Mouat tells BBC Scotland.
""That is always really nice to hear that you have that chance to get yourself into the history books. 
""To get to do it for the first time in 2018, it meant a lot. To win that event was crazy, so now, four years later, in 2022, going for a third title, it is a pinch myself moment, because it is a bit surreal."" 
Mouat's rink beat Italy 7-4 in Ostersund on Thursday, while the Yannick Schwaller's Swiss followed that on Friday with a 6-3 victory over the Swedish hosts, this time led by Oskar Eriksson instead of world and Olympic champion Niklas Edin.
28-year-old Scot points out that, although the Swiss rink is new this season, they topped the round-robin, during which they eased to a 7-2 win over the reigning champions.
""They are a very good opposition,"" Mouat says. ""They have been very well-established individual curlers and they have become a very strong team this year and won a lot of events over in Canada.
""It is going to be a tough game, but we know that we can beat them.""
Mouat and team-mates Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie and Hammy McMillan survived a tight last-four encounter against Joel Retonraz's Italian rink, who are the only side to beat the Swiss and who were unbeaten until losing to the Scots. 
Scotland had inched into a 3-1 lead only for the Italians to level with a double at the seventh end, but scoring four at the next gave Olympic and World silver medallist Mouat a match-winning lead.
Italy would later beat Sweden 10-7 in the bronze medal match.
Finishing in the top eight in the round robin had already qualified those sides for next year's World Curling Championships."	/sport/winter-sports/63747914
technology	Coding: Female engineers deleting myth that tech is for men	"Growing up, Zoe Thomas never thought she could work in computing
""I foolishly thought coding was for men good at maths."" 
Zoe Thomas, 29, from Caerphilly, felt she needed a new challenge but never thought she could work with computers.
But after taking evening classes in coding she switched careers from customer service to software engineering for an insurance firm.
Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that women make up 31% of staff in the wider technology industry.
But for software developers, web design professionals and data analysts, the proportion is far lower at just 18%.
""I never thought I could do it, but it's honestly the best decision I've ever made,"" said Zoe.
""Because I studied media, psychology and English at A-level I just didn't think I'd end up here,"" explained Zoe, who works for Veygo Insurance in Cardiff.
""I now help make the website function, adding features and sorting any problems that arise, and I really love it.""
Companies across the UK want more women like Zoe to work in the technology sector. 
More than 7,500 people work for insurance firm Admiral, which is based in Cardiff, but most of its technology staff are men. 
Admiral's director of IT, Christine Theodore, said the sector was so fast growing it was vital more women enter the industry.
""These continue to be the skills of the future,"" she said. ""People shouldn't shy away from it, these skills can be taught. 
""I've been in IT for most of my professional life and I feel really passionate that women can definitely be in leadership positions.""
Admiral has been working with several companies to appeal to more women, including the social enterprise Code First Girls.
It works with more than 100 businesses across the UK to teach women to code, including Zoe. 
Code First Girls CEO Anna Brailsford said there was a danger ""labelling"" girls in school could have a detrimental effect on their confidence. 
Coding is a set of instructions used to tell devices such as computers, mobile phones and even traffic lights and aeroplanes what to do.
People who work in coding say it's like learning a language that tells the computer what you want it to do. 
Coders, or programmers, are people who write the programs behind everything we see and do on a computer.
Girls outperform boys in IT at both A-level and GCSE, a Welsh government-commissioned report found, but far fewer girls choose to study the subject. 
Aisha Arshad, 32, from Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, has always worked in IT and studied it at A-level at school. 
She now works in coding for Admiral, collating information so performance can be analysed. 
""When I tell people about my job I often hear 'oh, it's a very male-dominated career',"" she said. 
""But I love it. It's not the same boring thing day in day out,"" she explained. ""I'm doing one thing one day, and then completely different problem-solving the next day."""	/news/uk-wales-63839738
business	Warning winter energy bills to rise by more than expected	"mestic energy bills could hit more than Â£3,600 a year this winter, according to a new forecast.
Consultancy Cornwall Insight said the typical gas and electricity bill in England, Wales and Scotland could reach Â£3,615 in the new year - hundreds of pounds more than previous predictions.
government has announced a package of measures to help households with the rising cost of living.
However, some have called for more support for families.

Cornwall Insight told BBC Breakfast that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,358 a year from October, then Â£3,615 a year from January.
much higher than earlier predictions.
Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said rising wholesale gas prices and concerns over Russian supply were behind the big leap, and warned the government help announced ""will only scratch the surface of this problem.""
""However, while the rise in forecasts for October and January is a pressing concern, it is not only the level - but the duration - of the rises that makes these new forecasts so devastating,"" he said.
""Given the current level of the wholesale price, this level of household energy bills currently shows little sign of abating into 2024.
In May, energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household should expect to see an Â£800 increase in October, to Â£2,800 a year.
However, it subsequently admitted that ""prices are looking higher than they did when we made that estimate"".

Many families are already facing soaring costs, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - at the highest in 40 years.
Last week, personal finance expert Martin Lewis said people would be ""panicking"" over their energy bills, and warned it would ""be desperate"" when bills rise this winter.
""It's going to throw many households into a terribly difficult financial situation,"" he told the BBC.
Mr Lewis said that more needed to be done now to help the poorest households.
A spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""While no government can control global gas prices, we are providing Â£37bn of help for households including the Â£400 discount on energy bills, and Â£1,200 of direct support for the most vulnerable households to help with the cost of living.""
Last week, the government announced how households in England, Scotland and Wales will receive that Â£400 to help with rising fuel bills this autumn with the money paid in six instalments.

Other measures include a Â£650 payment to more than eight million low-income households.

politics	Minister refuses to pause National Care Service plan	"Scottish government has been defending its plans for a new National Care Service.
government says the system will be the biggest shakeup of public services since the creation of the NHS and will end a social care ""postcode lottery"".
But questions have been raised about the cost of setting it up and what it means for local decision-making.
Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart faced calls to pause the scheme at Holyrood's finance committee.
Mr Stewart said there was no reason to do so but acknowledged that there were currently ""various unknowns"" that could have an impact on the financial cost of setting up the new service.
He promised that further details of the finances would be forthcoming, and said there was overwhelming support for the changes from people who rely on social care.
And he told the committee that the process of ""co-designing"" the legislation with other organisations meant certain financial assumptions could not be made right now.
Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith told Mr Stewart that MSPs did not currently have enough information to properly scrutinise the government's plans.
Ms Smith said the financial memorandum associated with the bill was the weakest she had ever seen in Parliament, and urged Mr Stewart to consider pausing the scheme until he was able to provide more detail.
government committees also spent Tuesday morning scrutinising the National Care Service Bill, which lays out the framework for the new system.
f the National Care Service were sown during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the virus took a terrible toll on many care homes.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a new body could provide a ""lasting and positive legacy"", in the same way as the ""tragedy"" of World War Two led to the creation of the National Health Service.
Post-pandemic, the government commissioned an independent review of adult social care, led by Derek Feeley, a former chief executive of NHS Scotland.
His report considered options which stretched as far as nationalising the private care sector - something ultimately deemed too expensive and time-consuming - before coming down in favour of a new national management body.
MSPs at Holyrood are now scrutinising the National Care Service Bill, which sets up the framework on which the new service will be built.
recreate a free-at-the-point-of-need system like the NHS, but for care.
It would set up a series of regional care boards, which Scottish ministers would ultimately be responsible for.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said this would end a ""postcode lottery"" and create uniform standards for care across the country.
He said this meant everyone would have access to ""consistently high-quality care and support so they can live a full life"".
Mr Feeley also said it could ""drive national improvements"" and help unite agencies and staff behind ""a common purpose"". 
w system would be a huge undertaking, drawing together social work, children's services and justice staff as well as those from care homes and care at home services.
Ministers say the new service will aim to support people in their own homes, or among family, friends or their community wherever possible.
It will also create a charter of rights and responsibilities for social care, with a robust complaints and redress process.
Pretty much everyone I talk to in healthcare, be it GPs, A&E consultants, social workers, or charities, support the idea of a National Care Service - but there are big concerns about how it is being shaped through this new bill. 
Some question a lack of detail saying it doesn't address how services are to be funded or staffed. Others have raised concerns that it takes accountability away from local communities.  
But the bottom line is that health and social care needs people to provide care and deliver services. That is something that we are extremely short of right now. 
We've heard a lot lately about record delays getting people out of hospital and how that leads to long waits in A&E.
roblem requires finding more social care support. It is a hot topic right now - but better integration between hospitals and community health and social care has long been seen as in need of improvement.
People are living longer with more complex conditions. That means a growing demand for carers, occupational therapists or district nurses. 
It can also take time to make a home accessible or fit additional equipment to help with everyday tasks. There can be differences in provision depending on where you live and that is something the National Care Service is supposed to end.  
Councils would essentially no longer be involved in the delivery of social care - and complain that this could undermine local accountability.
't like the idea of a ""power grab"" by central government, and are wary of the potential impact of tens of thousands of staff moving across from them to the new care service.
Local authority umbrella body Cosla said it could pose ""a serious risk to councils' ability to deliver a wide range of services for communities"".
Unite union called the proposals an ""all-out assault on local democracy"", while GMB Scotland said workers ""haven't even been an afterthought"" in the drafting of legislation.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservatives said setting up a new service would ""see precious resources diverted away from the front line and into employing hundreds more management and admin staff"".
Beyond these practical concerns, some charities have also raised questions about the care on offer.
Neurological Alliance of Scotland has described the service as  ""a vision without a blueprint"", adding that ""we can't tell if it will even stand up, much less that it will meet the care needs of people in Scotland"".
f the biggest questions - and controversies - over the plans, at least in terms of the debate at Holyrood.
Scottish government initially reckoned it would cost Â£500m to set up the new system, by the end of the current Holyrood term in 2026.
However, Scottish Parliament researchers have estimated the bill over five years to be somewhere between Â£664m and Â£1.2bn.
And Audit Scotland has warned that ""the potential for additional cost is significant"", highlighting issues with pensions, VAT changes, capital investment and health board transition costs.
SNP backbenchers have joined in with criticism, with finance committee convener Kenny Gibson saying the reorganisation was ""like a sledgehammer to crack a nut"" if it did not provide extra funding to address issues in the healthcare sector.
His SNP colleague Michelle Thomson said she had ""no confidence whatsoever"" that the financial memorandum accompanying the legislation represented any level of accuracy or value for money.
ge of the National Care Service Bill is really only the beginning at Holyrood.
It is a ""framework"" bill, meaning it sets out the broad overall plan for the service, before ministers add much more detail in the coming years.
So while the government hopes to pass the bill in the coming year, it will be some time before the final vision is realised.
Consultations are still ongoing about what exactly some of the new structures will look like, with ministers saying they want to ""co-design"" the system with people who have experience of care.

business	Kingfisher tycoon Vijay Mallya sentenced to jail in India	"India's top court has sentenced tycoon Vijay Mallya to four months in jail for disobeying an earlier court judgement linked to the collapse of his airline.
India has previously made efforts to extradite the former billionaire, who is believed to still be in London.
He made his fortune selling beer under the Kingfisher brand before branching out into aviation and Formula 1 racing.
Kingfisher Airlines was India's second largest domestic carrier before it collapsed a decade ago.
On Monday, India's Supreme Court found Mr Mallya guilty of contempt, as it said he failed to disclose his assets after defaulting on a loan.
He was found guilty of the same offence in 2017 for allegedly transferring $40m to his children, even as loans to Kingfisher Airlines remained unpaid, the court said at that time.
Known as the ""king of good times"", in a reference to his lavish lifestyle, Mr Mallya has fought extradition from the UK to India, where he faces charges including fraud.
Mr Mallya who left India in 2016 after defaulting on debts of more than $1bn (Â£842m), has denied fleeing the country.
Late in 2018, a court in London ruled that he could be extradited from the UK to India to face charges there.
In 2020, Mr Mallya lost his final appeal against his extradition at the High Court in London. However, he is still believed to be living in London.
Mr Mallya faces a number of charges related to alleged financial irregularities at Kingfisher Airlines.
rrier was wound down in 2012 amid reports that pilots and cabin crew had worked unpaid for 15 months.

sports	European Aquatics Championships: Laugher wins gold medal in 1m springboard	"Great Britain's Jack Laugher took gold in the men's 1m springboard at the European Aquatics Championships.
In changeable weather conditions at the outdoor venue in Rome, the three-time Olympic medallist, 27, took the lead with the second of his six dives and won comfortably with a score of 413.40.
Italy's Lorenzo Marsaglia claimed the silver medal with 396.25, and his compatriot Giovanni Tocci took bronze with 386.20.
Britain's Jordan Houlden came fifth.
""I'm feeling very happy,"" said Laugher. ""At the last Europeans it was a silver medal on the 1m and the previous one before that was gold so I'm happy to get my title back again."" said Laugher
""It was very consistent diving, nothing majorly wrong and no major hits either - today's been really difficult with the change in conditions throughout the day through sun, wind, rain and cloud but I'm really pleased with how I handled it.""
Earlier on Thursday, Amy Rollinson and Desharne Bent-Ashmeil finished narrowly outside the medal positions in the women's 3m synchronised springboard competition. 
British duo scored 257.40 with Sweden's Emilia Nilsson Garip and Elna Widerstrom pipping them to the bronze with 257.70.
In a repeat of the result from Budapest in 2021, Germany's defending champions Lena Hentschel and Tina Punzel took gold ahead of Italy's Elena Bertocchi and Chiara Pellacani.
Elsewhere the high diving competition got under way with Aidan Heslop and Owen Weymouth putting in their first-round dives from the 27m high platform. The pair currently rank sixth and 10th respectively, with the contest spread over three days."	/sport/diving/62595485
entertainment	Keith Lemon: I'm proud of career-defining Celebrity Juice	"For over 14 years and 307 episodes, celebrities have embarrassed themselves facing mortifying challenges on Celebrity Juice.
roughout has been Leigh Francis, known as Keith Lemon, and as the show comes to an end, he describes Juice as ""career-defining"".
Iconic figures Holly Willoughby and Fearne Cotton will return for the last one, joining current captains Emily Atack and Laura Whitmore.
""I'm super proud of it,"" Keith says.
""I guess that's why Holly and Fearne came about for the last one as well - it's a big part of their lives,"" he tells BBC Newsbeat.
Holly was on the show for 12 years, and Fearne was on it for 10 years.
But, when they stepped back from the show, Keith says, ""if [she] had been around"", Caroline Flack could have been on the programme.
Caroline passed away in 2020, and Keith says she was top of the list for a captain spot.
""She was a regular [on the show] and a mate in real-life that I would see all the time.""
""And I'd known Flack for years. She'd have been first on the list to move in and sit on more seats.""
Maya Jama, Joey Essex and Big Narstie will also make an appearance to say goodbye to the programme, which has been loved and feared by celebs for its unique games.
Over the years, the man behind the ""oosh"" says he would pilot challenges with the Juice team.
""We would meet up and do a games testing day, where we would just play these ridiculous games in a spare office in the building. It was a lovely time and it was insane,"" Keith says.
His favourite games? Well, he says those would be the ones that ""became classics"", such as Don't Show Keith Your Teeth and the Wibbly Wobbly game.
ugh Celebrity Juice might now be known for being raucous, raunchy and filled with swear words - it wasn't always this way. 
""I didn't really use expletives [at the start], but everyone's boozed up and I remember dropping an F-bomb to Fearne Cotton.
""And everyone went crazy. And then suddenly it got just ruder, and ruder.""
According to Keith, Fearne was more professional and didn't drink during filming. 
But, he says, she finally raised a glass for the final show. 
""Fearne told me she's never had a drink on Celebrity Juice ever until the last one, Thursday's show.""

politics	Rishi Sunak: World leaders welcome next UK prime minister	"World leaders have been reacting to Rishi Sunak's victory in the race to be the next British prime minister. 
Many offered their congratulations, and expressed hope for stability after a ""turbulent"" few weeks. 
What the leadership is saying: ""As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues, and implementing Roadmap 2030,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, referring to a framework agreement struck between the two countries. ""Special Diwali wishes to the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership.""
What the press is saying: Mr Sunak's appointment has been big news in India, with Indian news channels breaking into rolling coverage. ""Indian son rises over the Empire, history comes full circle in Britain,"" was how one channel put it.
kground: It is no surprise that there is a lot of interest in Mr Sunak's rise in India. His grandparents come from Punjab, while his father-in-law is Narayana Murthy, the founder of Infosys and one of India's best-known businessmen. Sunak is also a Hindu who took his oath as MP on the Hindu holy book the Bhagavad Gita. India and the UK have been trying to strike a free trade deal, but talks reportedly stalled over fears among Sunak's party it could lead to more immigration. 
What the leadership is saying: Kenya's president, William Ruto, has yet to comment publicly on Mr Sunak's new position. 
What the press is saying: The Taifa Leo newspaper called Mr Sunak's rise another ""Barack Obama moment"". ""Sunak's case is nearly similar to that of former US President Barack Obama, who is an American citizen but has Kenyan roots as his father was born in Homa Bay County,"" Citizen Digital website said. Popular newspaper commentator Macharia Gaitho said ""Kenya has conquered the British Empire"". 
kground: Mr Sunak's father, Yashvir, was born in colonial Kenya to parents who had moved from Gujranwala, now in Pakistan, in the 1930s. Mr Sunak's father moved to the UK in the 1960s, where he became a GP. 
What the leadership is saying: European Council President Charles Michel said: ""Working together is the only way to face common challenges... and bringing stability is key to overcoming them.""
kground: Rishi Sunak is a Brexit supporter, but many EU leaders will have breathed a sigh of relief that he, not Boris Johnson, is taking over as prime minister, our Europe editor Katya Adler says. He is considered a pragmatist, and EU officials will want to work with him on rising energy costs, and the difficult issue of the Northern Ireland protocol, an important trading arrangement struck during Brexit talks.
During the August leadership contest, Mr Sunak said a trade war with the EU was not in the UK's interest. But finding compromise may be politically difficult for him, and Brussels fears he might shun working with the EU to protect his political support at home. 
What the leadership is saying: Irish PM MicheÃ¡l Martin said he looked forward to working with Mr Sunak, ""on the important issues we face on these islands and globally"".  
What the press is saying: The Irish Times welcomed Mr Sunak's reputation for ""sensible politics"", but said he will face challenges, particularly with Brexit. It is not yet clear what his election means for the Northern Ireland protocol, the paper said. The Irish Independent said the new prime minister had been ""vindicated"" after the ""folly"" of Ms Truss's tax cuts. 
kground: Brexit remains one of the key issues between the UK and Ireland, with the Northern Ireland protocol now at the forefront of the agenda. Currently, goods being imported from Britain are checked before entering Northern Ireland. But the UK government previously called for a two-tier system, with checks only being conducted on goods destined for onward travel to the republic. 
Watch: Biden calls Sunak's rise to UK prime minister a ""ground-breaking milestone""
What the leadership is saying: At a White House event to mark the Hindu holiday of Diwali, President Biden described Mr Sunak's nomination as the UK's next prime minister a ""ground-breaking milestone"". The US president is holding back on formally congratulating Mr Sunak until he has met King Charles and been asked to form a government, as protocol dictates. 
What the press is saying: The New York Times lauds the ""record of representation"" built by the Conservatives in recent years, saying Mr Sunak's victory is another milestone in a history of promoting women and people of colour to prominent positions. The Washington Post also emphasised Mr Sunak's position as the first person of colour to be prime minister. The paper added that it would be ""the first time in history that the residents of Downing Street are richer than those of Buckingham Palace"". 
kground: Joe Biden has already said he would maintain a ""close relationship"" with whoever succeeded Ms Truss. He called her abandoned plans to cut taxes a ""mistake"", causing some eyebrows to be raised - US presidents tend to avoid commenting on allies' domestic policies. 
What the leadership is saying: China wants to ""advance ties with the UK"" under Sunak, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. He added: ""We hope that we can work with the UK side on the basis of mutual respect and win-win co-operation and advance China-UK relations along the right track.""
What the press is saying: State-run CGTN highlighted reports that Mr Sunak will be the first prime minister to be richer than the monarch. ""His experience managing the UK's finances, and in particular his strongly-voiced opposition to Truss' disastrous plans for borrowing-funded tax cuts, prompted many in the party to view him as the safest choice,"" it said. Shanghai-based The Paper wrote that Sunak's victory ""would appear to signal a new achievement in his efforts to overcome racism in British politics"" but that it ""could not overshadow his other controversies"", mentioning the BBC video clip of him saying he had no working class friends in 2007, and his wife's previous non-domiciled status which excused her from paying some tax. 
kground: Rishi Sunak has favoured closer ties with China than his predecessor, and was criticised by Ms Truss for pursuing a trading relationship when chancellor. Ms Truss spoke of a need to avoid ""dependency"" on China, and during the summer leadership race said she would declare the country a ""threat"" to national security - a label already given to Russia. She also was reported to have privately supported declaring China's actions against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjang a genocide. 
What the leadership is saying: President Zelensky tweeted his congratulations to Mr Sunak. ""I wish you to successfully overcome all the challenges facing British society and the whole world today. I'm ready to continue strengthening the Ukraine-UK strategic partnership together!"" he said. Oleksandr Kornienko, the First Deputy Chairman of Ukraine's parliament, said he welcomed Mr Sunak as a ""colleague"". He added: ""Congratulations to the people of Great Britain on the fact that they have political stability again. After a short stage of turbulence.""
What the press is saying: The Glavkom website said both Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson would have been ""good news"" for Ukraine. Mr Sunak's remarks on Ukraine so far have been ""promising"", the website said, contrasting his statement in a debate that he does not want to meet Vladimir Putin with Liz Truss's readiness to speak to the Russian president. 
kground: UK policy towards Ukraine will not change under Mr Sunak. During the summer leadership contest, he said he would continue backing Ukraine, and make an early visit to Kyiv. But while Ms Truss promised to increase defence spending from 2% to 3% of national wealth - measured by gross domestic product - by 2030, Mr Sunak has said that target was ""arbitrary"" and ""not a plan"".
What the leadership is saying:  Russia sees no reason to expect relations with the UK to improve under Mr Sunak, the Kremlin said on Tuesday. 
What the press is saying:  All three main TV channels - the state's official Rossiya 1, state-controlled Channel One, and Gazprom-Media's NTV - have pointed out that Mr Sunak was elected unopposed.  TV's London correspondent Liza Gerson said this was an example of ""British democracy not for everyone"" - with Sunak voted in by so few that it amounted to a statistical ""margin of error"". Channel One correspondent Timur Siraziyev said Mr Sunak was toeing his party's line on Ukraine - ""to keep the conflict in Ukraine going as long as possible"" - and it was therefore ""not to be expected that with the advent of the new prime minister, relations between our countries will improve"".
kground: Russia-UK relations have soured even further since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. The UK responded with several rounds of sanctions, and it is one of the main backers of President Zelensky. The UK has also provided substantial military support to Ukraine. 
What the leadership is saying: Treasurer Jim Chalmers called Mr Sunak a great friend of Australia. ""I don't think it's insignificant a country like the United Kingdom has its first prime minister of colour,"" he said. 
What the press is saying: ""Sunak â one of the richest men in the House of Commons â may not be breaking the Tory tradition of elevating Oxford-educated elites, but his leadership will be historic. He will be Britain's first prime minister of colour.""
kground: Mr Sunak previously criticised the trade deal with Australia and New Zealand that Liz Truss negotiated as trade secretary, calling it ""one-sided"", and saying the UK ""shouldn't be rushing to sign trade deals as quickly as possible""."	/news/uk-63378673
health	Cornwall tourist died after two-hour wait for ambulance, inquest hears	"Ambulance delays in Cornwall ""significantly reduced"" the chances of a man surviving a stroke, an inquest has heard.
Reedman, 54, died four days after suffering a stroke while on holiday in Cornwall in June 2021.
quest heard he waited nearly two-and-a-half hours for an ambulance to take him from his holiday cottage to the Royal Cornwall Hospital at Truro.
mong three in the county raised with the government.
Andrew Cox, senior coroner for Cornwall, said ambulance delays in the case of Mr Reedman and two others, David Morganti and Winnie Barnes-Weeks, were either the cause or a contributing factor in their deaths. 
Mr Reedman, from Norfolk, started feeling unwell on the evening of 26 June and his wife, Jill, dialled 999.
rs suspected he was having a stroke and graded him as a priority two - meaning an ambulance should have reached him within the national target of 18 minutes.
He underwent surgery in hospital, but developed a cerebrovascular infarction and died four days later.
Guy Davies, assistant coroner for Cornwall, said the delay in the ambulance reaching Mr Reedman directly led to the delay in treatment starting at hospital, which could have saved his life.
""I find that the delay between the 999 call and Tony being taken to hospital significantly reduced his chances of surviving the blood clot,"" he told Cornwall Coroner's Court.
""The average stroke patient has a one in three chance of a positive outcome following treatment by thrombolysis in the first hour following a stroke.
""This is reduced down to one in 30 after four-and-a-half hours. Tony's stroke was more serious than the average.
""I find on the evidence it is not possible to definitively determine whether Tony would have survived if he had arrived at a hospital earlier and been treated earlier.""
In a preventing future deaths report to Health Secretary Steve Barclay, Mr Cox said hospital bed-blocking and ambulance delays were ""recurring themes"" in the cases.
He said he had been told by the medical director at the South West Ambulance Service Trust that delays were being caused by ambulances being in the ""wrong place at the wrong time"".
""When they are required for emergency responses, they are parked outside Royal Cornwall Hospital with patients in the back for extended periods,"" he wrote.
""On occasions this summer and autumn, there have been queues of over 20 ambulances outside the emergency department and delays have been longer than a paramedic's shift.""
roner said the Royal Cornwall Hospital's medical director had told him there had been at times the equivalent of five wards of patients fit for discharge, but they could not leave due to problems with the social care sector.
Mr Cox wrote about a fourth inquest into the death of Robert Conybeare, which found he died after suffering a fall in hospital at a time when he was fit to be discharged but there was no suitable social care support.
He wrote: ""My central concern is how the delays that are currently manifest can be mitigated in the intervening months, particularly given the likely increase in demand for ambulances/hospital admissions during the winter months.""
report gives the Department of Health and Social Care until 10 January to respond to the coroner's concerns.
A spokeswoman said: ""Each of these four deaths is a tragedy and our sympathies are with the families affected.
""We have received the prevention of future deaths report and will be responding to the coroner in due course.
""We have prioritised health and social care in the autumn statement, with an additional Â£6.6bn available over the next two years, to tackle the backlog, speed up discharge and ensure patients are getting the care they deserve quickly.""
In a joint statement Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Integrated Care Board (ICB), Cornwall Council, Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust and South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust extended their sincere condolences to the families of the patients referenced in the report.
Kate Shields, ICB CEO, said: ""The report highlights the complex pressures on all parts of our health and care system that our staff are working tirelessly to resolve.
""We have recently introduced new ways of working with the aim of reducing delays in patients' journeys from their admission through to discharge in both our acute and community services.
""These changes have resulted in some improvement in ambulance response and handover times in Cornwall but we will continue to focus our efforts until we are confident all patients get timely access to care.""

sports	Amir Albazi: Iraqi MMA fighter dreams of becoming first Arab UFC champion	"Amir Albazi's journey to become the first Iraqi man fighting for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may have been tougher than any of his bouts to date.
rising talent in professional mixed martial arts (MMA) was born in Baghdad but grew up in Sweden, after his family fled Iraq to escape Saddam Hussein's authoritarian regime.
Albazi arrived in the Nordic country as a boy who could not speak a word of Swedish - and he experienced severe culture shock in his new surroundings.
""In school, I couldn't understand what people were saying, but I could tell they were making fun of me,"" he told the BBC. 
""The only way I could express myself was with my fists.""
29-year-old said his world was transformed when, by chance, he found MMA on TV. It was love at first sight.
MMA combines techniques from different disciplines of martial arts, including kickboxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing and wrestling.
rt was conceived in the early 1990s as a way to find the best combat style. It now boasts millions of fans worldwide, and the UFC is its biggest promoter.
Albazi immediately sought the nearest gym in Stockholm where he could learn the sport.
At the time, MMA was viewed as too brutal for adolescents, so the young refugee could only train in jiu-jitsu, a martial art based on ground fighting and submission holds.
rt gave him confidence and steered him away from the troubles that surrounded him in the tough Stockholm suburb of Bredang.
He won several major jiu-jitsu titles as a teenager and travelled around Europe for MMA bouts, lying about his age so he would be let into the cage.
He moved to London to study sports science and then relocated to Las Vegas, where the UFC is based.
As a professional, Albazi is known by his ring name, ""The Prince"" - a translation of his Arabic first name.
He now has almost 15 years of experience in the sport and wants to become the first Iraqi and Arab champion in the UFC's history. 
""I feel a great responsibility on my shoulders being the only Iraqi in the UFC. I feel as if I am representing my country and the whole Arab world,"" he said.
Albazi competes in the flyweight weight category (53-57kg; 116-125lbs) and boasts an impressive record of 15 wins and only one loss, with the majority of his victories coming by way of choke holds.
He will next appear in the ring in Las Vegas on 17 December to face Alessandro Costa of Brazil.
""My plan is the same as always. I will take him down, wear him out and get the choke,"" he said.
Albazi explained that he eventually plans to return to Iraq and develop MMA there.
""All Iraqis are champions at heart, so it will come naturally for them. All they need is the support and facilities to train,"" he said.
Following his last UFC win, Albazi met with the spokesman of the Iraqi military to discuss ways to evolve the sport.
His dream is to inspire a generation of young athletes in the Arab world - just as the Russian fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov and the Cameroonian star Francis Ngannou have done elsewhere.
Despite growing up abroad, Albazi has remained close to his culture, and always enters fights with the Iraqi flag draped over his shoulders.
""Many Arabs in the West shy away from their heritage, but it should be the opposite,"" he said. ""Arab traditions and values make me who I am and give me strength.""
In a recent documentary, he extolled the health benefits of pacha, a traditional dish made from slow-boiled sheep heads and other innards.
Albazi credits much of his success to his Islamic faith.
""I have seen many of the top fighters stressed before they fight. Because of my belief in God I always remain calm. I know everything has been written for me,"" he said.
But his work ethic also helps him excel, he said. ""My whole career if people did 10 reps, I would stay after training and do extra,"" he said. 
""I have never been talented, the strongest, the smartest... I was stubborn."""	/news/world-middle-east-63993032

technology	Apple store Glasgow workers unionise in UK first	"Glasgow Apple store workers have become the first in the UK to secure official union recognition.
GMB union organiser John Slaven called it a ""compelling new chapter in the trade-union story"" being written around the world.
Earlier this year, workers in the Maryland branch formed the first Apple retail union in the US. 
Glasgow's Buchanan Street Apple store staff previously said union recognition would be used to bid for higher wages.
An Apple official told BBC News: ""We have long been committed to providing an excellent experience for our customers and teams. 
""Apple is one of the highest-paying retailers in Scotland and we've regularly made enhancements to our industry-leading benefits as a part of the overall support we provide to our valued team members.""
In June, after joining the GMB and filing for voluntary union recognition, workers at the store told the Glasgow Evening Times they earned about Â£12 an hour.
""People are suffering with the cost-of-living crisis,"" one said.  
""We need a pay rise, pay transparency and a voice.""
Mr Slaven said Wednesday's union-recognition ballot result was ""testament to the hard work of the activists and workers"" in the store. 
wo-thirds majority showed the union was ""pro-worker and not anti-employer"" and ""trade unionism should be a normal and welcome feature of any workplace"".
move comes amid increased unionisation efforts from workers worldwide at technology giants such as Activision Blizzard, Amazon and Google parent company Alphabet.
Last month, Labour leader Keir Starmer urged Amazon to officially recognise GMB workers, after a strike ballot fell three votes short of a 50% threshold."	/news/technology-63485697

Whether it is making sure snacks are at hand by the sofa at home or heading out to a bar, supporters from across the globe will be watching on to see if Argentina captain Lionel Messi can crown his international career by leading his country to World Cup glory in Qatar.
Not so for everyone associated with St Thomas', Dunloy, Ballyhale Shamrocks and Ballygunner, the four clubs that will contest the All-Ireland club hurling finals at the GAA's Croke Park headquarters in Dublin. 
Connacht champions St Thomas' take on Ulster winners Dunloy at 13:30 GMT - 90 minutes before Messi and co kick-off in the Lusail Stadium - with the champions of Leinster and Munster, Shamrocks Ballyhale and Ballygunner, throwing in at 15:30.     
And, what about the prospect of going head-to-head for attention with an occasion that Fifa said was watched by a combined global audience of 1.12 billion in 2018?   
""It doesn't really matter to us because we are all hurling men,"" St Thomas' Fintan Burke said in a matter-of-fact fashion. 
""To be honest with you, it wouldn't really affect us. We don't care if there are only two people watching our game on telly. It doesn't affect us and we don't let it affect us.""
It's worth noting that the GAA has previous for its own flagship events being scheduled at the same time as major sporting occasions.
In June 2002, for example, Derry and Donegal played out the first half of their Ulster semi-final at a largely-empty St Tiernach's Park in Clones while fans opted to watch the Republic of Ireland's World Cup last-16 defeat by Spain on penalties. 
GAA stuck with its original throw-in time, which meant supporters had a choice to make when the Republic-Spain game went to extra-time and a shootout. 
governing body had a different approach four years later when the K Club hosted the Ryder Cup, with the All-Ireland football final being moved from its original date to avoid competing with the biennial USA-Europe showdown.
St Thomas' lost to Ballyhale Shamrocks in last year's All-Ireland semi-final but have made it through to this stage again by winning their fifth consecutive Galway title, beating Loughrea in the final. 
ub are aiming for what would be a second All-Ireland title after claiming their first in 2013 and, while some members of the current panel were in that squad, Burke and the majority of his team-mates were not.
""For a lot of us, we don't have an All-Ireland medal,"" he continued.
""I think there are 25 of the whole panel who are without one and the older lads are not shy in letting us know that we don't have one, either. 
""It would be nice to just get one and to have one in your back pocket when you retire - it's not something that many people have.""   
uccessful in their All-Ireland bid, St Thomas' will have to overcome a Dunloy team that won their first Ulster club title since 2009 with victory over holders Slaughtneil in a thrilling final.
Burke watched that match, which Dunloy won 2-12 to 0-16, and was full of praise for the quality of hurling teams in Ulster.
""Every year good teams come out of Ulster, you don't win it easily as there are a lot of good teams there,"" he said. 
""We have seen that through the years. Having played three or four of them we know the level that Dunloy are going to be at. 
""Having played Loughrea twice in the last few weeks, they are similar to them - quick, they run and are good, sharp-shooting hurlers. Hopefully that might stand us in good stead."" 
Burke is one of four brothers in the St Thomas' panel and the family ties extend even further, with his older brother, Kenneth, the team's manager.
He was clear that there is no conflict of interest for any of the family and also added that, while hurling is hugely important to everyone in the squad, family and friends take priority.
""We are probably old enough now to realise he [Kenneth] has a horrible job at the best of times without us making it any more difficult for him,"" he commented.
""The respect is there, you leave the family at home. The respect is there on the hurling side, too, when you see what he has done and all that he has achieved for the club. It means you have enough respect to not question him, go against him or make his life difficult.""
He added: ""We have our values when it comes to hurling but it is only a sport. Family and friends are more important. 
""Hurling is great and we love it, it is what we live and die for, but I suppose we are all best friends, everyone on the panel. 
""We would do anything for each other and we would help each other out off the field as well as on it. To be honest, family comes first and it always will. Your health is your wealth and hurling only comes afterwards if you are able to do it.""   "	/sport/gaelic-games/63973638

business	US economy shrinks again sparking recession fears	"US economy has shrunk for the second quarter in a row, a milestone that in many countries would be considered an economic recession.
US, which uses additional data to make that call.
But the contraction, at an annual rate of 0.9% in the three months to July, has drawn widespread attention as worries about the economy grow.
Prices for groceries, petrol and other basics are rising at the fastest pace since 1981.
As the US central bank raises borrowing costs quickly to try to cool the economy and ease price pressures, fears are rising that a recession is coming - if it has not officially started already.
Faced with sinking public confidence, US President Joe Biden has tried to make the case that the economy remains sound, noting that the unemployment rate remains at a low 3.6% and hiring has remained strong.
""If you look at our job market, consumer spending, business investment - we see signs of economic progress,"" Mr Biden said Thursday, noting the historic post-pandemic gains the US experienced last year. ""There's no doubt we expect growth to be slower than last year .... That's consistent with a transition to stable, steady growth and lower inflation.""
week, ahead of the data from the Commerce Department, he told reporters that the economy was ""not going to be in a recession"". That prompted his opponents in the Republican party to accuse the White House of trying to redefine the term.
""White House recession 'rebrand' won't reduce Americans' suffering,"" they said. 
In the first three months of the year, the US economy shrank at an annual rate of 1.6%. At the time, economists attributed the decline in gross domestic product (GDP) to quirks in trade data. 
But Thursday's report showed more marked slowdown, with growth weighed down by declines in the housing market, business investment and government spending. Consumer spending grew at a slower annual rate of 1%, as people spent more on healthcare, accommodation and dining out, but cut back on goods and groceries.
Harvard professor Jeffrey Frankel previously served on the National Bureau of Economic Research committee, the group of academics that is charged with making the official declaration of recession. 
He said he did not think a recession started at the beginning of the year, noting the strong jobs growth. But after that he was less confident.
""Things have already slowed down, so I'm not saying that everything is great,"" he said. ""Odds of a recession going forward are substantially higher than for a random year.""
Inflation in the US hit 9.1% in June, the fastest pace of price appreciation in more than four decades. 
On Wednesday, the US central bank responded to the problem with another unusually large increase to its key interest rate, its second 0.75 percentage point rise since it started raising rates in March.
By making borrowing costs more expensive, the Federal Reserve is hoping to reduce spending on items such as homes and cars, in theory easing some of the pressures putting up prices. But lower demand also means a decline in economic activity. 
Recent reports have shown consumer confidence falling, the housing market slowing, and the first contraction in business activity since 2020. 
US stock market has sunk since the start of the year, and companies from social media giant Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to carmaker General Motors have said they plan to slow hiring. Some other firms, especially in the property sector, have announced job cuts.
Sasan Kasravi lost his job in June working as a speech and debate coach in the Bay Area. 
31-year-old said he was not personally worried about facing a long bout of joblessness. But his views of the economy are bleak, consistent with surveys showing less than 15% of Americans describe economic conditions in the US as good.
""I think everybody is sort of waiting for the pandemic to blow over, for the war in Ukraine to settle down, but that's not going to resolve any of the inherent systemic flaws,"" he says, citing high housing costs, student debt and speculative bubbles in sectors like crypto.
""It seems to be built on stilts and we're all wondering if this is the thing that sends it plunging."" 
Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said this week that he did not think the US economy was in recession, but he noted that some slowdown had begun and more was likely to be necessary for inflation to return to more normal levels.
Just how severe the expected downturn will be remains a matter of heated debate.
""The last time we saw inflation this high, in the 1980s, we had a pretty deep recession,"" said Laura Veldkamp, finance professor at the Columbia Business School. She said policymakers have learned from that experience, raising hopes for a milder downturn.
But slowdowns in China and in Europe, which has been hit harder by the surge in energy prices from the war in Ukraine, raise risks from abroad. Nor is the US alone in raising interest rates.
""Many other countries have more serious problems... and they will very likely get hit and that could spill over to us,"" Prof Frankel said.
He said it was important to consider factors such as the labour market to determine the start of a recession, noting that some downturns, like the burst of the dot com bubble in 2001, would not qualify as a recession under the two-quarters-in-a-row-of-contraction rule, despite the many jobs lost.
Estimates of output in the large US economy often get updated significantly as more data comes in. Even in the UK, there are cases of recessions getting revised away.
Politics, he added, has nothing to do with it, at least historically.
""Every knowledgeable macroeconomist knows that recession in the US is not defined by a mechanical rule,"" Prof Frankel said. ""But given the polarisation of politics, there are people who are going to be cynical about it and assume the worst."""	/news/business-62310355
sports	Bellator v Rizin: AJ McKee on his father, being a 'teddy bear' and the Pitbull trilogy	"AJ McKee Jr was about 12 years old when he asked his father what would turn out to be a lifechanging question.
Growing up in California, McKee spent a lot of time with MMA legend Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson and found himself captivated by the former UFC light-heavyweight champion's lifestyle.
""He was a big jokester, a lot like my father - very laid back and a good heart - but you don't wanna see him mad,"" McKee tells BBC Sport.
""We'd sit in a car he'd made into a limo and during camps he'd go into the gym to train while I'd be sat playing video games.
""We'd go to his house and have barbeques, pool parties, and I was like 'Dad, why don't you have this? We need this life. We deserve this.'""
McKee's father Antonio was a successful fighter who ended his career in 2019 with a fine record of 30 wins and six defeats.
Despite his sporting success, he never reached the same level of stardom as Jackson, and this is what confused McKee.
Looking back, McKee points to the difference in fighting style between the athletes.
""Rampage is a knockout artist. It was such a new, fast-growing sport and everyone wants to see the knockouts and the finishes,"" he says. 
""My father was a brute - a very high-evel wrestler - and nobody could stop his takedowns, but at the time that wasn't what people wanted to see.""
McKee says it used to bother his father when he asked why he did not have the same recognition as Jackson, and this is what initially drove him to pursue his own career in the sport.
On Saturday McKee, 27, will headline a cross-promotional event in Japan between Bellator and Rizin, when he faces Roberto de Souza at lightweight.
Former Bellator featherweight champion McKee is arguably the biggest star in the promotion and will be looking to improve his record of 19 wins and one defeat.
""That's where it became kind of personal with me, like 'I'm going to be your revenge in this sport where they have no choice but to recognise our last name in the industry',"" says McKee.
""My dad is my training partner to this day at 52 years old. He's in the gym with me every day so we came up with a style that was entertaining. 
""We know I have the wrestling background, so I can get someone to the ground, but it was trying to implement the striking and give fans the entertainment they needed - the knockouts, the submissions.""
Away from the cage, McKee describes himself as an ""adrenaline junkie"" with a passion for fast cars, shooting and snowboarding, but also a ""big teddy bear, loving and softly spoken"".
His success enables him to embrace aspects of Jackson's life he admired as a youngster, but he takes a more reserved approach, being conscious of the example he sets for his friends and family.
""When you're a provider you take care of your family and everyone around you and you have to be cognitive of your expenses - that's something my dad kind of made me realise early on,"" says McKee.
""He said you can dress a certain way, you can show people with the work you put in this is what they can expect, but if they don't put in the work they can't expect it.""
Following the sole defeat of McKee's career in a rematch with Patricio 'Pitbull' Freire in April when he lost his title, McKee went through a bout of depression.
""When I heard 'unanimous decision', it was like my whole world crumbled in front of me,"" says McKee.
""I wasn't really open to anyone about it, you know? My 16-year-old brother has lived with me for around four years now. I wasn't talking to him about anything but he could tell I was hurt. 
""I was walking through the house and not saying anything, sleeping all day, and I wasn't able to really verbalise it.""
After some self-reflection, McKee opened up to his loved ones and now uses the experience to help others.
""Depression is big right now, post-Covid, and our younger generation took a big impact on their social lives,"" he says.
""My younger cousin and brother have been through it a bit, so going through something like that myself opened my mind up, and being able to express that to other people and let them know you have people there for you, to verbalise it and reach out...
""I know the first step is hard because you feel vulnerable, but I feel that's the key.""
McKee's Bellator rival Freire is fighting in the co-main event on Saturday against Rizin's featherweight champion Kleber Koike.
McKee and Freire have one win each against each other, with McKee winning their first encounter in July last year, and he is targeting a trilogy bout.
""It's only right for his legacy and for my legacy. It's what the fans want and hopefully it's what he wants,"" says McKee. 
""I don't know how he feels about the last fight but I feel the game needs to be settled and see who the best of the best is.
""It's not about the money or the belt any more - it's for the legacy. We can't leave an open door like that."""	/sport/mixed-martial-arts/64110403
business	Fraud victims face call waiting lottery from banks	"Victims of fraud have no idea how long they will be stuck on the phone trying to report the crime to their bank, an investigation has found.
Average waiting times can range from 16 seconds to more than 30 minutes - depending on the bank, according to tests by the consumer group Which?.
More priority should be given to distressed victims, it said.
Co-operative Bank, which recorded the worst times in the exercise, said it had faced staff recruitment issues.
It added that retention of workers had also been a problem, as had sickness levels as a result of the pandemic.
Which? tested 11 banks and building societies by calling each of them 12 times at different times of the day over the course of a week in March. 
It dialled the phone numbers listed on each bank's website for reporting current account fraud - only some of which are dedicated hotlines. Monzo was excluded as it told people to use an in-app chat function. Six of 11 banks' helplines charged a fee, Which? said. 
wered fastest lasted only 10 seconds. That was made to First Direct - a bank designed to communicate with customers primarily over the phone. First Direct also had the shortest average call waiting time of 16 seconds.
One call to the Co-operative Bank went on for more than an hour before being answered. Its average waiting time was the longest, at 31 minutes and 40 seconds.
, across all the calls to all the banks, the testers from Which? had to wait for 10 minutes and 51 seconds before speaking to someone.
Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said:  ""The feeling of being scammed is already stressful enough for victims, without having to wait long periods just to get through to your bank. 
""Victims are told to contact their bank immediately because every second counts. Some firms taking longer than half an hour to answer victims' calls shows the lack of support with which certain banks have treated fraud victims for far too long.""
Hutt is among those to have faced a long wait trying to deal with a potential fraud on his account.
71-year-old had spotted a suspicious transaction on his balance and called his bank to stop what looked like a fraudulent subscription.
After three or four attempts, including waiting for over an hour, he eventually got through. The web-chat system he tried directed him to the same phone number.
""I'm sure I wouldn't have had to wait for more than an hour if I was in a branch,"" he said.
A spokeswoman for UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said: ""We know the devastating impact that fraud can have on victims and so firms always strive to respond to calls in good time. 
""Given fraud cases are often complex an appropriate amount of time needs to be spent on each call so customers get the right support, which can have an impact on call times.""
Hundreds of millions of pounds a year are stolen in so-called authorised push payment fraud - when victims transfer money to a business or organisation they believe to be genuine but is actually a con-artist.
Some victims have got their money back from banks, while others have lost out.
Proposed legislation in the Queen's Speech should mean there is a consistent approach to refunds in the future. It will be up to the Payment Systems Regulator to frame those rules, after banks were unable to do so between themselves.
At present, some banks have signed up to the 159 pilot scheme. It encourages customers to hang up from a phone call that might be a scam, for example one that asks for personal information or money, and to dial 159 to speak to their bank. 
Citizens Advice urges anyone who believes they are the victim of a scam to protect from further loss by resetting passwords, reporting the issue to their bank immediately - and possibly to the police on the 101 number - and checking if they are entitled to the money back. "	/news/business-61550686
health	Covid in China: US imposes Covid testing for visitors from China	"US has become the latest country to impose Covid testing on visitors from China, after Beijing announced it would reopen borders next week.
Italy, Japan, Taiwan and India also announced mandatory tests, but Australia and UK said there were no new rules for travellers from China.
After three years of being closed to the world, China will let people travel more freely from 8 January.
But the country's ongoing Covid surge has sparked wariness. 
China is reporting about 5,000 cases a day, but analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily case load may be closer to a million. Hospitals are overwhelmed and residents are struggling to find basic medicines, according to reports. 
On Wednesday, the US said a lack of ""adequate and transparent"" Covid data in China had contributed to the decision to require Covid tests from 5 January for travellers entering the country from China, Hong Kong and Macau.
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was needed ""to help slow the spread of the virus as we work to identify... any potential new variants that may emerge"".
But Beijing's foreign ministry on Wednesday had said coronavirus rules should only be instated on a ""scientific"" basis and accused Western countries and media of  ""hyping up"" the situation.
Some people reacted angrily on China's censored social media. 
""I thought all of the foreign countries had opened up. Isn't this racism?"" read one comment that was liked 3,000 times on Weibo. The US has said testing is required of anyone coming from China, or via a third country, regardless of nationality.
But others said they understood the reason for the conditions: ""This is nothing compared to all the restrictions we had for people coming into China,"" one user wrote. 
Beijing only announced on Monday its decision to end quarantine for arrivals - effectively reopening travel in and out of the country for the first time since March 2020. Until this week, anyone entering China had to undergo quarantine in state facilities. 
Before the pandemic, China had been the world's largest outbound tourism market. But it's unclear how many Chinese people will travel abroad after 8 January given that the number of flights are limited, and many citizens need to renew their passports. 
rnational community's reaction has varied with the UK and Australia saying they were monitoring China's Covid situation but were not planning on announcing new testing requirements.  
Others have moved swiftly to announce restrictions:
European Commission said its health security committee would convene on Thursday to discuss ""possible measures for a coordinated EU approach"" to China's Covid surge. 
But Italy, an EU member state and an epicentre of the virus in late 2019 and 2020, said it was moving first to ""ensure the surveillance and identification"" of any new variants of the virus.
Flights arriving in Milan this week were already testing passengers from China. Authorities found 52% of passengers were infected with Covid on one flight that landed on 26 December.
Initial tests of Covid-positive travellers arriving from China showed that 15 of them had Omicron variants that were already present in Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said. She described the news as quite reassuring.
Italy is one of 26 European countries in the border-free Schengen zone and Ms Meloni is calling for EU-wide testing of Chinese passengers, arguing that Italy's own measures might otherwise be ineffective. 
China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that ""currently the development of China's epidemic situation is overall predictable and under control"". 
However, the true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown as officials have stopped requiring cases to be reported, and changed classifications for Covid deaths. On Sunday, officials said they would also stop releasing daily case counts.
""The infection surge in China is on expected lines,"" Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an Indian epidemiologist and health systems specialist told the BBC in a recent interview. 
""If you have a susceptible population that is not exposed to the virus, cases will rise. Nothing has changed for the rest of the world.""
China's decision to reopen its borders marks the end of the country's controversial zero-Covid policy, which President Xi Jinping had personally endorsed. 
Even as the rest of the world transitioned to living with the virus, Beijing insisted on an eradication policy involving mass testing and stringent lockdowns.

Citizens have expressed relief but also concern about the sudden changes.
""Finally! I will no longer worry about getting infected or being taken away as a close contact,"" one person wrote on Chinese social media.
Another said: ""Can anyone explain to me what's happening? Why is the change all of a sudden and so major?""
weeping changes indicate China is finally moving away from its zero-Covid policy and looking to ""live with the virus"" like the rest of the world. 
untry is grappling with its biggest wave of infections - over 30,000 each day.
Some users online have questioned the accelerated opening-up - ""The medical system will be overwhelmed and many elderly would be infected. It [a major wave of infections] begins now,"" one user wrote.
But many others rejoiced at the loosening of a policy that had controlled their lives for nearly three years.
Until now, China had forced people with Covid and anyone who was a close contact to go to quarantine camps. 
unpopular because it separated families and removed people from their homes. Some of the centres were also reported to have poor living conditions and inadequate staff. 
Videos all year have shown guards dragging people out of their homes after they refused to go. Viral footage from Hangzhou last week showed a man fighting off officials.
China's National Health Commissioned announced a swathe of other new freedoms on Wednesday. They said:
w guidelines also included a strict ban on blocking fire exits and doors. That follows reports of people being locked into their homes during an earthquake, and buildings being sealed under lockdown measures. 
recent protests were triggered by a deadly fire in the western Xinjiang region - critics said the victims had been unable to escape the building because of lockdown measures, but Beijing denies this.

re have also been repeated reports of delays to emergency medical care for people in locked down areas.
On Wednesday, authorities also stressed the need to accelerate the vaccination of elderly people.
""All localities should adhere to.... focus on improving the vaccination rate of people aged 60-79, accelerating the vaccination rate of people aged 80 and above, and making special arrangements,"" the National Health Commission said.
Since the protests on 24-26 November, Chinese authorities began to release some cities from lockdown. Officials had also begun to tone down language around the dangers of Covid.
untry's vice-premier, Sun Chunlan, flagged last week that China was entering ""a new situation""  in the pandemic and said the virus's ability to cause disease was weakening. 
Experts have warned any easing of zero-Covid in China would have to be done slowly - as the country of 1.4 billion people could see a huge jump in cases that could overwhelm its healthcare system.
Speeding up vaccination of its elderly population is key, health experts say. 
""The main way for China to exit Covid with the least damage is via vaccination and three doses of vaccination is a must,"" Prof Ivan Hung at Hong Kong University told the BBC earlier this week.
""Hopefully before Chinese New Year [in January 2023] as there will be a large movement of the population travelling and returning home,"" he added.
China's international borders also remain closed to most foreigners, however some analysts say this rapid change shows the country could re-open next year."	/news/world-asia-china-63855508
technology	Security warning after sale of stolen Chinese data	"President Xi Jinping has urged public bodies to ""defend information security"" after a hacker offered to sell stolen data of one billion Chinese citizens.
In an advert on a criminal forum, later removed, the user said the data was stolen from Shanghai National Police.
ker claims the information includes names, addresses, National ID numbers and mobile phone numbers. 
Cyber-security experts have verified that at least some of a small sample of the data offered is real.
23 terabytes of data is thought to be the largest ever sale of data on record and was being offered for $200,000 (Â£166,000) until the post was removed on Friday.
No Chinese officials have responded to the news and President Xi did not make direct reference to the data sale.
But, according to the South China Morning Post, the president has asked public bodies in China to ""defend information securityâ¦ to protect personal information, privacy and confidential corporate information"" to ensure people feel secure when submitting data for public services.
On Friday, the moderators of the website where the sale was listed - by a user called ChinaDan - posted a notice which read: ""Dear Chinese users, welcome to our forum. You most likely came here because of the Shanghai police database leak. The data is no longer being sold, and posts related to this topic have been deleted.""
website administrators then added that they have many other similar and high quality Chinese databases for sale, adding: ""We are not in China and we are not Chinese, so we do not have to obey Chinese laws.""
According to DarkTracer, which monitors cyber criminal activity, another hacker - perhaps inspired by the publicity surrounding ChinaDan's offer - posted an advert on Tuesday for 90 million Chinese citizen records, which the hacker claims to have stolen from Henan National Police (HNGA). None of that data has been verified.
""It remains unclear exactly why the data has been withdrawn,"" Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at Darktrace said. 
""The original offer of sale suggests that the hacker was looking to sell the data to several buyers without exclusivity, rather than just one. 
""So one theory is that for a high enough price exclusivity could have been bought, and that kind of purchase could possibly have been made by the Chinese state itself.""
Mr Lewis believes the leaked information could have been a major concern for Chinese authorities which reportedly blocked discussions of the sale on Chinese social networks shortly after it was advertised.
Deb Leary, CEO of Forensic Pathways, also believes the data may have been sold to a high bidder, but adds: ""It's interesting, and not unexpected, that the hacker forum used the incident as a way to promote themselves as a go-to place for stolen data. 
""They don't seem to be worried about angering the Chinese authorities.""
In April a popular hacking website called Raid Forums was seized and shut down in an international police operation led by the FBI. 
's Portuguese founder, and a British man based in Croydon, were arrested.
Large data sets such as the Chinese cache can be used by hackers to send impersonation emails and other malicious attacks to trick people into handing over cash to criminals.
But now the data has disappeared it may never be possible to verify it.
Another theory is that the data and ChinaDan could have been discovered to be fake by the website administrators.
However Louise Ferrett, Threat Analyst at Searchlight Security, thinks the data could well be genuine.
""There are indications that the data on sale was legitimate. Firstly, the source of the data has been reported by some security teams as human error on the part of a government developer,"" she said.
""Secondly, multiple sources have confirmed that the sample data that the seller, known as ChinaDan, provided was legitimate. 
""This doesn't necessarily mean the entire database was real but these two elements combined do certainly make it more likely,"" said Mrs Ferrett. "	/news/technology-62097594

""Put simply, we cannot provide an emergency general surgery service without a consultant surgical team in place to provide the required 24/7 cover.""
Ms McKay said the trust had done everything it could to maintain services and was disappointed by the announcement. 
She explained they had held six recruitment rounds since 2016 and in that time the hospital had gained five consultant surgeons.
However, during the same period SWAH lost six consultants - three of whom retired while the other three moved on to other jobs.
""Unfortunately we have now come to a position whereby, come the end of January, I will have no substantive [staff] consultants in post in South West Acute Hospital in the general surgical specialty.""
Speaking about the implications for patients, Ms McKay said: ""I completely understand the anxieties of the population of Fermanagh and south Tyrone, especially rural areas.""
Ms McKay said she was aware one of the key anxieties is what would happen in the case of a major road crash.
""We have agreed with emergency department team and trauma network that SWAH will remain a trauma-receiving unit,"" she said.
Emergency general surgery relates to the treatment of patients with conditions such as acute abdominal pain, infections, bleeding and trauma.
It includes operations such as removing a patient's gall bladder, appendix or part of the bowel.  
If left unattended these conditions can become life-threatening. 
According to the Western Trust, SWAH deals with about five such cases a day and that is not enough to sustain a dedicated emergency general surgical team. 
In a briefing on Thursday afternoon, the trust said there would be no change to emergency C-Section births, though if a patient is deemed at risk they will opt to deliver elsewhere.
""Fermanagh is so isolatedâ¦ It's madness, people will die,"" County Fermanagh resident Jimmy Hamill told BBC News NI.
He was among people who began to gather outside Enniskillen Town Hall on Thursday evening in reaction to the announcement.
Mr Hamill described the move as ""lunacy"" and said he believed it was part of a ""choreographed plan"".
A former SWAH medic also questioned the ""temporary"" nature of the move, suggesting the trust had used that word euphemistically.
""In my experience, having worked in the health service for over 40 years, once the word temporary is used, therefore it becomes permanent,"" Prof Mahendra Varma told the BBC's Evening Extra programme. 
""So I don't accept what the Western [Trust] board is saying with regards to it being temporary.""
retired consultant cardiologist was among the medics who were involved in the establishment of the hospital 10 years ago.
Prof Varma also told the programme he did not believe the trust had made enough efforts to replace retiring surgeons.
Another former SWAH worker, Diane McCaffery, described the decision as ""shocking"".
Ms McCaffery is a retired emergency care manager who worked at SWAH's cardio assessment unit
She told BBC News NI she has seen first-hand how emergency surgery has saved lives. She said she thinks this decision is ""catastrophic"" and that Fermanagh residents were the ""poor relatives of this country"".
Western Trust said existing services including its emergency department and obstetrics remained unchanged.
It added there would be ""minimal to no impact"" on the other existing services at SWAH.   
rust said it was liaising with colleagues in the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and the Southern Health Trust on the new arrangements. 
When the hospital becomes Northern Ireland's third elective surgical hub it is planned that it will tackle waiting lists.

business	Arriva bus workers to strike over 'real term pay cut'	"About 900 bus workers are due to go on strike in a dispute over pay.
Unite union said workers at the Arriva Bus Company had been offered pay rises of 4%-6%, but high inflation meant it was a pay cut in real terms.
ustrial action on 5 and 6 September will affect the company's depots in Luton, Aylesbury, High Wycombe, Milton Keynes, Ware, Stevenage and Hemel Hempstead.
Arriva said it was ""focused on offering a fair and affordable pay deal"".
, which will have an impact on services across Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire, is due to run from 03:00 BST on 5 September to 02:59 on 7 September and Unite said more strikes would be scheduled if the dispute was not resolved.
union said Arriva had offered drivers, administration staff, engineers, cleaners and shunters pay rises, but as inflation was 12.3%, using the government's retail price index measurement for 17 August, this represented ""a pay cut in real terms"".
It also said the pay offer for drivers was tied to a reduction of 16.6% in overtime rates and Arriva also wanted to end paid time for compulsory duties outside of driving, such as travelling to a bus stop or to pick up a bus mid-route.
Regional officer, Jeff Hodge, said: ""Our members are striking as a last resort because Arriva is refusing to offer a reasonable pay rise, despite being more than able to afford to.
""The company is responsible for the severe disruption these strikes will cause.
""We urge them to return with an offer our members can accept to end this dispute as soon as possible."" 
An Arriva spokeswoman said: ""We remain focused on offering a fair and affordable pay deal, as well as ensuring our vital bus services and networks are sustainable across the region.""

business	Oil price rises as EU cuts Russian imports	"Oil prices have hit fresh highs after European Union leaders agreed on a plan to block more than two-thirds of Russian oil imports.
Brent crude rose above $123 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest it has been for two months.
Prices for oil and gas have soared in recent months, fuelled by the lifting of lockdowns and the Ukraine war.
Rising energy costs are putting pressure on consumers, making it more expensive to heat homes and drive.
Petrol hit a new record of 173.02p a litre on Monday, according to the AA.
At the same time, the average price of diesel in the UK rose to 182.58p a litre, it said.
Filling a typical 55-litre tank of a diesel now costs more than Â£100.
war in Ukraine has pushed countries in the West to shun Russian energy supplies.
Russia currently supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil and 40% of its gas. The EU pays Russia around â¬400bn (Â£341bn) a year in return.
greed by EU leaders will see an immediate ban on Russian oil being transported into the bloc by sea. Two-thirds of Russian oil arrives by sea.
However, the deal, which followed weeks of wrangling, includes a temporary exemption for pipeline oil following opposition from Hungary.
Pledges by Poland and Germany to stop importing pipeline oil by the end of this year will raise coverage of the ban to 90% of Russian imports.
Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil prices, has risen more than 70% over the past year.
Oil prices climbed again on news of the EU embargo, with Brent crude reaching its highest level since March.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said confirmation that the EU will cut its purchases of Russian oil by the end of 2022 is pushing up prices because European countries now need to find alternative sources of supply.
""It is not feasible to replace that amount of energy with other fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass or nuclear, in such a short space of time, so the EU needs to find oil and gas from somewhere,"" Mr Mould said.
""This will not be easy because existing global output may well be on contract already, so competition for what is not on contract will now be hotter.""
Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the upwards trajectory of oil prices may continue until Western countries outline clearly how supply is going to be sourced.
""It's possible this could get tougher before it gets better,"" she said.
""We know that rising energy costs are a particular challenge for households which already have severe pressure on their incomes, but smaller businesses shouldn't be left out of the equation either - this is a tough time to be heating offices, and at a time when it's meant to be about rebuilding resilience after the pandemic.""
European Council chief Charles Michel said the deal cut off ""a huge source of financing"" for the Russian war machine.
It is part of a sixth package of sanctions approved at a summit in Brussels, which all 27 member states have had to agree on.
So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen.
EU members spent hours struggling to resolve their differences over the ban on Russian oil imports.
Hungary, which imports 65% of its oil from Russia through pipelines, resisted the new round of sanctions.
f living crisis being felt across Europe has not helped either. Sky-rocketing energy prices - among other things - have curtailed some EU countries' appetite for sanctions which could also hurt their own economies."	/news/business-61643613
sports	Tokyo Olympic gold medal replaced after first got bitten	"An Olympic gold medallist will be given a new medal after the mayor of her hometown chomped on the first.
kashi Kawamura, mayor of Japanese city Nagoya, sparked fury online when he lowered his mask and bit on softball athlete Miu Goto's medal at an event.
He was accused of ignoring Covid-19 restrictions and ""lacking respect"".
Now, Olympic officials say they will swap Ms Goto's medal for an untarnished one, after the mayor apologised and said he would pay for a replacement.
mayor faced a backlash after putting the medal between his teeth at a ceremony last week to celebrate Japan's victory over the USA in the women's softball final. 
Social media users said the act was unhygienic and impolite towards the athlete.
""Apart from showing a lack of respect for athletes, he bit it even though [athletes] are putting on medals themselves or on their team-mates during medal ceremonies as part of infection prevention measures. Sorry, I can't understand it,"" Japanese silver medallist fencer Yuki Ota wrote on Twitter.
""Germ medal"" was soon trending on social media in Japan.
Even Toyota, the owners of the team Ms Goto plays for, condemned the gesture, calling it ""inappropriate"" and ""extremely regrettable"".
72-year-old mayor apologised later for his actions, which reportedly prompted over 7,000 complaints to city authorities.
""I forgot my position as Nagoya mayor and acted in an extremely inappropriate way,"" he said, adding that he wanted to pay for a replacement medal.
A statement from Tokyo 2020 organisers on Thursday said the replacement had been agreed between the International Olympic Committee and Ms Goto. The IOC would cover the costs, it said.
Biting medals is a common quirk at the Games, but is usually reserved for winners.
kyo 2020 organisers appeared to make light of the incident in late July when they tweeted: ""We just want to officially confirm that the #Tokyo2020medals are not edible!""
Neither Mr Kawamura nor Ms Goto had any immediate comment."	/news/world-asia-58186002
politics	Rishi Sunak: A quick guide to the UKâs new prime minister	"former chancellor Rishi Sunak is the UK's new prime minister. Here's what you need to know about him.
He lost to Liz Truss in September, but she resigned six weeks later. In the latest leadership contest, Mr Sunak racked up the support of his fellow MPs early, and fast. He crossed the 100 nominations he needed long before the deadline - including from MPs that had previously backed Truss or Boris Johnson.
He clashed with the former PM during the previous leadership race, claiming her plan to borrow money during an inflation crisis was a ""fairytale"" that would plunge the economy into chaos.
His parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin. Mr Sunak was born in Southampton in 1980, where his father was a GP and his mother ran a pharmacy. He went to the boarding school Winchester College, then studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford, and business at Stanford in America. He is now the first British Asian prime minister.
Mr Sunak was first elected as an MP in 2015 - for Richmond in north Yorkshire - but rose quickly, and was made finance minister - or chancellor - in February 2020 under Boris Johnson. 
As Mr Johnson's chancellor, Mr Sunak was behind the financial aid during lockdowns - including furlough payments and the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme for restaurants.
His wife is Akshata Murty, the daughter of Indian billionaire Narayana Murthy. Mr Sunak himself has worked for investment bank Goldman Sachs and at two hedge funds. The Sunday Times Rich List estimates the couple's fortune to be worth about Â£730m. They have two daughters.
Over the summer, it emerged Akshata Murthy paid no UK tax on big earnings abroad - which is legal. Mr Sunak defended his wife saying, ""to smear my wife to get at me is awful"" - but eventually she agreed to start paying extra taxes. We also found out he temporarily had a US green card, allowing him to live permanently in America while he was the UK's chancellor.
""Free ports"" are one of his long-time favourite ideas: areas near ports or airports where goods can be imported and exported without paying taxes, to encourage trade. 
In 2016, he told a group of schoolchildren that he originally wanted to be a Jedi Knight when he grew up. His favourite Star Wars film is The Empire Strikes Back. "	/news/uk-63345272
politics	I regret Williamson job ended in resignation, says Rishi Sunak	"Watch: Starmer labels Gavin Williamson a 'pathetic bully'
Rishi Sunak has said he regrets Sir Gavin Williamson's ministerial appointment ended in resignation amid bullying claims against him.
rime minister said Sir Gavin had been right to resign, adding his behaviour had been ""unacceptable"".
Mr Sunak said he had not known of ""specific concerns"" about his conduct in two previous ministerial roles.
But Labour's Sir Keir Starmer accused him of failing to ""stand up to a run-of-the-mill bully"".
Sir Gavin was appointed minister without portfolio after Mr Sunak, a political ally, won the Tory leadership and became prime minister two weeks ago.
Mr Sunak has faced criticism over the decision in recent days, following claims of abusive behaviour by Sir Gavin towards MPs and the emergence of a complaint by a civil servant.
Sir Gavin, who has denied any wrongdoing, quit on Tuesday night, vowing he wanted to ""clear my name"" during probes into his past conduct.
Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak said it was ""absolutely right"" Sir Gavin had gone, and that his behaviour was now being investigated. 
Asked by Sir Keir whether he regretted appointing Sir Gavin, Mr Sunak replied: ""I obviously regret appointing someone who has had to resign in these circumstances.""
Complaints against Sir Gavin emerged after expletive-laden texts he sent to then-chief whip Wendy Morton last month were published in the Sunday Times.
A civil servant then told the Guardian Sir Gavin had told them to ""slit your throat"" and ""jump out of the window"" on separate occasions during his time as defence secretary.
Sir Gavin's former deputy, Anne Milton, has also claimed he had behaved in a ""threatening"" and ""intimidating"" way towards MPs while he was chief whip.
At PMQs, Mr Sunak said he ""did not know about any of the specific concerns"" about his conduct as defence secretary or chief whip. 
Downing Street has previously said the PM was aware of a ""disagreement"" between Sir Gavin and Ms Morton before appointing him, but not the detail of the messages he had sent her.
In response, Labour's Sir Keir said Sir Gavin had ""spent years courting the idea that he can intimidate others, blurring the lines to normalise bullying behaviour"".
Referencing the pet tarantula kept by Sir Gavin when he was chief whip, he called him a ""cartoon bully with a pet spider"". ""It's precisely why the prime minister gave him a job,"" he added.
Labour leader also criticised Mr Sunak for thanking Sir Gavin for his ""personal support and loyalty"" in a letter responding to his resignation.
""What message does he think it sends when, rather than take on the bullies, he lines up alongside and thanks them for their loyalty?"" Sir Keir added.
Sir Gavin has been reported to the MPs' bullying watchdog, the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, over his messages to Ms Morton. The Conservative Party is mulling whether to launch a formal probe of its own.
Following the accusations about his time as defence secretary, No 10 had said it was seeking to establish the facts. Mr Sunak's spokesman had said the PM ""would act if and when he felt it was appropriate to do so""."	/news/uk-politics-63571086
business	Energy companies' customer service hits record low	"Customer service standards at energy companies have fallen to a record low as households are being hit by soaring bills, Citizens Advice has said.
Standards have ""plummeted"" since June 2021 when several suppliers went bust due to high global gas prices, it said.
rage waiting time on the phone to speak to a firm is now about six and a half minutes, compared to just under four minutes the year before.
Citizens Advice called for improvements before bills rise again in the autumn.
rgy price cap, which limits how much suppliers can raise the cost of household bills, went up by an unprecedented Â£700 a year to Â£1,971 in April for the typical household. Bills are expected to rise by a further Â£800 a year in October.
rise in bills is down to wholesale gas prices soaring in recent months. Demand increased as economies reopened following Covid restrictions, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has fuelled fears over supplies, pushing prices up further. 
rease in the wholesale cost of gas - the price at which energy companies buy it - caught many suppliers out and meant they were losing money on price promises to customers. This led to several, mostly smaller, firms going bust and millions of customers being shifted to new suppliers.
Between January and March 2022, Citizens Advice said its consumer service helpline saw more than 70,000 cases related to energy issues - a 63% increase on the same period the previous year.
rity said it was ""particularly worried"" about people on prepayment meters, who it said are at risk of having no gas or electricity if they can't afford to top up.
It warned that ""without swift action"" to tackle poor customer service, standards ""will only worsen when bills are expected to hike again this winter"".
Energy suppliers are obliged to help people who cannot afford their bills.
""At a time when customers need all the support they can get, it's worrying to see service performance is the worst on record,"" said Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice.
""This leaves people frustrated and in the dark at the end of the phone.
""We recognise call centre staff are working incredibly hard to answer as many calls as possible, but energy companies must do better.""
Citizens Advice said companies were also getting slightly slower to respond to emails. On average, suppliers responded to 62% of emails within two working days, compared with 66% during the same period in 2021. 
rity ranked energy suppliers through its ""star rating"" after looking at information from a number of sources, including its complaints to its consumer service and the energy ombudsman.
It ranked Utilita, Ovo Energy, Ecotricity and E.On Energy as the four worst performing suppliers for customer service.
Utilita, which was rated the worst of all, said it had ""issues"" with Citizens Advice's approach to recording complaints, ""regardless of whether we are at fault"".
""Yet again, the Citizens Advice Star Rating fails to reflect neither the unique nature of our business nor the service our customers receive,"" a spokesman said.
It accused Citizens Advice of not adjusting its records to reflect ""where the supplier has done nothing wrong, and we have had no contact with the customer"".
""We acknowledge that we can do better, but we strongly believe Citizens Advice employs a methodology that is unfairly weighted against us as a smart prepay specialist.""
E.On said it had seen an ""unprecedented spike"" in contact from customers during the months ahead of the April price change and apologised to ""any customer who feels our service fell short around this time"".
Ecotricity founder Dale Vince said Citizens Advice's numbers ""do not represent our current performance"".
He said since the statistics were recorded, the company had recruited more staff to cope with higher demand.
Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, said it was working with suppliers to improve service, adding that ""now is the time for them to up their game"".
""Our top priority is to protect consumers, and as these stats from Citizens Advice show, there are areas where customers are simply not getting the service they desperately need and rightly expect in these very difficult times,"" it said.
""We are clear with suppliers - they must not use the current gas crisis as an excuse for poor performance or sharp practices."""	/news/business-62008383

Warriors beat the league-leading Boston Celtics on Tuesday but this was their 12th loss in 14 away games.
Coach Steve Kerr earned a technical foul for his furious reaction after Stephen Curry appeared to be caught on the head as he made a three-point shot.
""I felt like we were on the bad end of things to start the game,"" he said.
""That needs to be called.""
Warriors were 14 points down early in the second quarter but briefly threatened to reel in the Bucks - who they succeeded as NBA champions in June - as they closed to within six.
But the hosts proved too strong and Kerr pulled his starters out of the game in the final stages in order to prepare for their trip to the Indianapolis Pacers on Wednesday. 
Elsewhere the Celtics got back on track with a 122-118 overtime win at long-time rivals the Los Angeles Lakers. 
Jayson Tatum scored 44 points for the visitors, who improved their NBA-leading record to 22 wins and seven defeats this season.
Anthony Davis scored 37 points with 12 rebounds and LeBron James added 33 points with nine rebounds and nine assists but the Lakers lost for the fourth time in their last five games.
Lakers, who are 12th in the Western Conference, were subjected to stinging criticism from NBA great Charles Barkley.

politics	Teachers' strike in Scotland to go ahead as new pay offer rejected	"Scotland's biggest union of teachers will take industrial action on Thursday after a new pay offer was dismissed as ""insulting"".
Employer Cosla made the fresh proposal which will see rises of up to 6.85%.
It was an improvement on the previous offer of 5% but still well below the 10% the unions want. 
rike by members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) will lead to the closure of most schools in Scotland. 
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville believed the offer was fair and recognised that the ""cost of living crisis is the priority"".
Under this latest proposal teachers earning less than Â£40,107 would receive an extra Â£1,926 a year - equivalent to a 6.86% uplift for the lowest paid.
wo bands were being offered a 5% uplift, with those on Â£60,000 or more receiving no more than Â£3,000.
Ahead of the new offer being made, the education secretary told the Scottish Parliament that the 10% demand by teacher representatives was ""unaffordable"" for the Scottish government.
EIS said its salaries committee unanimously rejected the offer in a special online meeting on Tuesday. 
Its general secretary Andrea Bradley said it was a ""divisive offer...which is actually worse for many teachers in promoted posts"".
""Our members will see this offer for exactly what it is - a kick in the teeth from their employers and the Scottish government,"" she added. 
""This afternoon's salaries committee expressed outrage at this offer, and that outrage is sure to be replicated in staffrooms across Scotland today and tomorrow. 
""Our programme of strike action, which will commence as scheduled on Thursday, will clearly show the strength of feeling of Scotland's teachers who will be out in numbers and with strong voice on picket lines and at regional rallies.""
A spokesman for the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association (SSTA), which is planning a strike on 7 and 8 December, described it as a ""very disappointing offer"". 
""The unions have been led down the garden path by Cosla and the Scottish government and tell us they care about teachers and value their commitment over the last few years,"" the spokesman said.
""This offer will not go down well with teachers and I would expect the planned strikes to go ahead. Maybe they will listen to parents and children as they are not listening to teachers.""
Meanwhile a third teachers' union - the NASUWT - says its members have voted for strike action, which will take place on 7 and 8 December. 
will take action short of strike action from 9 December, refusing to cover for absent colleagues and attending no more than one meeting per week outside pupil sessions. 
Mike Corbett, the union's national official Scotland, said: ""Our members are angry, demoralised and have had enough. 
""They are sick of being expected to put up with declining wages while working ever harder to meet the increasing challenges being faced in our schools. They are facing increasing financial hardship with more teachers having to cut back on basic necessities.""
Cosla, the umbrella body for Scotland's 32 councils, had called on the EIS to postpone Thursday's strike.
Spokeswoman Katie Hagmann said: ""We have worked extremely hard and closely with Scottish government to ensure such a revised offer could be brought forward and made today. 
""I would call on our trade union colleagues to recognise that these are extremely challenging financial times we are operating in and we all need to make decisions with a full understanding of the consequences.
She added that it was is ""in line with offers made to all other parts of the public sector"".
Meanwhile the Scottish Conservatives were highly critical of the education secretary's role in the negotiations with teaching unions. 
""It should never have reached the stage where the SNP Government were scrambling around at the eleventh hour trying to strike a deal with teachers, and it's no surprise that this last-gasp offer has been rejected,"" Stephen Kerr, the party's education spokesman said. 
""Shirley-Anne Somerville has been missing in action as strikes have loomed large for months...The whole saga has shown that Shirley-Anne Somerville lacks the leadership required to resolve disputes satisfactorily."""	/news/uk-scotland-63715723
health	Malta moves to ease EU's last total ban on abortion	"Malta's government is to propose a change in the law to allow doctors to terminate a pregnancy if a mother's life or health is at risk.
mall Mediterranean state has the only total abortion ban in the EU.
Ministers promised to review the law when a US tourist was denied an abortion after she began to miscarry.
Andrea Prudente, who was 16 weeks pregnant, was told doctors could do nothing while the baby's heart was still beating.
Facing a potentially deadly infection she asked for an abortion and after days of waiting she was eventually allowed to fly to Spain.
Maltese Health Minister Chris Fearne said a legal amendment would go before parliament in the coming days to ensure doctors were now legally protected in cases of medical complication that left a mother's life at risk or her health in grave jeopardy due to the pregnancy.
Malta's criminal code currently says any doctor who knowingly provides a woman with the means for a termination faces a jail term of 18 months to four years and a permanent professional ban. Any woman who arranges her own termination is also liable to face jail, although no woman is thought to have faced criminal charges in years.
Last July Ms Prudente told the BBC that a midwife at Mater Dei hospital in Malta had told her that doctors might intervene ""when I would be on the 'brink of death'"". However, the head of the Malta College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said they would have never allowed her condition to deteriorate to that extent.
Pro-choice gynaecologist Isabel Stabile, one of 135 doctors in Malta who challenged the law, said the government had confirmed that the last blanket ban on abortion in the EU would end.
She said the change was a ""step in the right direction"" but did not go far enough: ""There will still not be any provision to terminate pregnancies in cases of rape or incest, or in cases of fatal, fetal anomaly."" 
minister said the spirit of the law and medical ethics was to save lives, so the change ensured that the principle was enshrined in law.
Prime Minister Robert Abela told The Times of Malta earlier this month that women had told him that he had to recognise the reality that women were unable to seek medical help if they suffered complications for fear of being sent to jail.
""These past months I've met tens of women who aborted using a tablet. Conservatively, around 300 or 350 women abort this way every year,"" he said. ""All these women told me the same thing: that they had been stigmatised and that none of them had found any sort of support.""
Malta is a predominantly Catholic country and a recent survey indicated 61.8% of people were completely opposed to abortion.
Some Maltese have argued that the law has acted as a deterrent. ""When mothers are faced with life-threatening conditions then doctors can intervene,"" Christian Briffa of anti-abortion youth group, I See Life, told the BBC during the summer.
But Justice Minister Jonathan Attard said the reform would remove any form of doubt and ensure patients received the best healthcare."	/news/world-europe-63650476

politics	Fact-checking Rishi Sunak's first PMQs	"Rishi Sunak faced his first Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.
Here are a few of the claims he made.
Mr Sunak quoted the police numbers in response to a question from Sir Keir Starmer. 
Labour leader wanted to know about  Home Secretary Suella Braverman - who is in charge of policing - and whether her ""integrity and professionalism are beyond question"". 
A target to recruit 20,000 additional police officers in England and Wales by March 2023 was set out in the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto. 
It was an attempt to reverse cuts since 2010, which had seen the number of officers fall by about 19,000.
Figures released on Wednesday, for the period up to 30 September, show that just over 15,300 officers have been recruited. 
So, police forces still have to recruit almost 5,000 more officers to meet the spring deadline.
re also having trouble retaining officers. 
In the year to March 2022, more than 8,000 police officers left forces in England and Wales. That's a 35% increase on the previous year and the highest volume of leavers in almost 20 years.
re are concerns about the impact of so many experienced officers leaving.
rime minister was responding to a question about the need for more doctors and dentists.
He's got his numbers about right. 
re were about 4,000 more community and hospital doctors, and 9,230 more nurses and health visitors working in the NHS in England in June 2022 (the latest figures available) compared with the previous June. That's an increase of about 3% of each.
However, NHS data suggests the number of vacant nursing posts may have increased slightly since last year.
means there might be more staff coming on board, but not fast enough to keep up with growing demand.
rime minister was asked by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas if he would reverse the decision of predecessor Liz Truss to end the ban on fracking.
Ms Lucas drew attention to the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto, which said: ""We will not support fracking unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely.""
Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a method of recovering oil and gas from shale rock using water, sand and chemicals at high pressure.
Chaos surrounding a vote on fracking was one of the events that led up to the resignation of Liz Truss.
At PMQs, Mr Sunak said he stood by the manifesto stance on fracking.
Downing Street later confirmed it was now government policy to maintain the moratorium.
During the leadership campaign in the summer, Mr Sunak had mirrored the position of Ms Truss on fracking. He said he would support it ""if local communities support it"".
Mr Sunak was responding to a Labour MP who said a nurse would have to work for thousands of years ""to match the vast wealth of this prime minister"".
He was involved in decisions about public sector pay when he was chancellor, from February 2020 until July 2022.
re was particular criticism in March 2021 for the proposed 1% pay rise for nurses in England, which was increased to 3% in July that year, with the award backdated to April. 
Office for National Statistics Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings gives yearly figures for workers in particular jobs.
In the category ""nursing professionals"", median pay - the amount that half of nurses would be earning more than and half earning less than - was Â£28,864 in April 2020 and Â£31,676 in April 2022.

technology	Meet the BBCâs 'undercover voters' for the US midterms	"As US voters get ready to vote in the midterms, a number of recent news events are shaping their social media feeds - the raid on Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago as he's investigated for possibly mishandling documents, abortion bans, and debates about gun rights. For Americast and Newsnight, BBC's Disinformation and Social Media correspondent Marianna Spring is investigating what voters are recommended online at a turbulent time for US politics. 
I've created social media accounts belonging to five fake characters, who reflect views from across the political spectrum in the US. The people I created are based on data by a US think tank which defined types of voters after surveying more than 10,000 randomly selected US adults.
I've given each of them five profiles across Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter - with names and computer-generated photos. They are: Larry, the Faith and Flag conservative; Britney from the Populist Right; Gabriela, the less political Stressed Sideliner; Michael, the Democratic Mainstay; and Emma from the Progressive Left.
After just a week of running the accounts, Britney - the Populist Right Voter - has already been recommended and has encountered pages on Instagram and Facebook continuing to promote disinformation that Trump really won the 2020 election. She's also come across similar content on TikTok. False claims are sometimes accompanied by violent rhetoric in reference to Trump's opponents. 
In contrast, the accounts belonging to Michael - the Democratic Mainstay, and Emma - the Progressive Left voter, have been pushed memes celebrating the investigation into Trump and quizzing why this didn't happen sooner. 
Britney's feeds include suggestions that the recent raid on his home in Mar-a-Lago just confirms he was actually victorious and the State is out to get him. Several of these pages opt for phrases like ""Trump won"" rather than ""stop the steal"", which was the term used on social media ahead of the riots at the Capitol. 
riots - and the wave of false claims about fraudulent voting in their build-up - have marked a turning point in the US. Now, more than ever, there are questions about how misleading and harmful posts online could affect voters heading to the polls, and social media sites have made fresh commitments to tackle it.
BBC's experiment so far suggests those same false claims about ""ballot mules"" and ""ballot trafficking"" from the 2020 election continue to spread online. Britney has also come across other anti-Semitic conspiracies about sinister global plots - and been recommended conspiracy-inspired pages. 
kTok told the BBC, ""We take our responsibility to protect the integrity of our platform and elections with utmost seriousness."" 
It says it prohibits election misinformation, ""provides access to authoritative information through our Election Centre"" and works with independent fact-checking organisations. 
Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, says ""it has hundreds of people across more than 40 teams working on the midterm elections"", as well as ""robust measures in place to combat misinformation"". That includes partnerships with 10 fact-checking organisations in the US. 
Larry - the Faith and Flag conservative - has been recommended similar content about the raid on Trump's home, as well as repeated pages promoting guns and other weapons. 
However, the feed belonging to Emma - the Progressive Left voter - also featured more about influencer Andrew Tate, recently banned from Instagram and Facebook for promoting misogyny online. The videos on her feed rejoice his ban, whereas none of the other older voters have encountered anything similar. 
unt of Gabriella - the undecided voter - hasn't been exposed to much politics at all, whether Trump or Tate. Her profiles are generally apolitical and so, instead, her social media feeds are dominated by posts about her hometown of Miami, fashion, dance, and saving money during the cost of living crisis. 
rofiles are all informed by data from Pew Research Center, which defined nine different typologies of US voters who sit along the political spectrum after conducting a wide-ranging survey in 2021.
BBC has selected five of those nine types and based the characters on data about their demographic, age, interests and opinions on different political issues. The five types chosen aim to reflect a cross-section of the US electorate with a range of views and backgrounds. 
Democrat-leaning and Republican-leaning groups that the characters are based on offer insight into what the greatest proportion of active voters on the political right and left can be exposed to online. The more apolitical Stressed Sideliner type makes up relatively less of the electorate compared to all of the other right or left-leaning groups.
I'll be logging on regularly to each of the accounts for a similar period of time to like the kinds of posts they would, check what they've been recommended, and see where the social media algorithms take our characters. I use a VPN on each of the phones, so my location can be set to the US. 
According to research from Pew, around seven in 10 Americans use social media - and this is one of the only ways of interrogating the subjective social media worlds of different voters that we can't usually access. 
While it can't offer an exhaustive insight into what every US voter could be seeing on social media - and they don't have friends or followers - it gives us a snapshot into what different types of voters across the political spectrum are exposed to when they log onto their phones. 
re are a series of recent news events that are shaping some of the voters' social media feeds. The raid on Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago, as he's investigated for possibly mishandling documents. The Roe v Wade ruling that made abortion legal across the US was overturned. The war in Ukraine, debates about gun rights and a cost-of-living crisis across the world. 
r accounts are all private - and they don't comment or talk to anyone real. They just like, follow and join groups, pages and accounts as per their interests and recommendations. 
Here's an explanation of who they are and what they like. 
Larry is what is known as a Faith and Flag conservative. This group has the oldest voters according to Pew's research - with a third over 65. Larry, a retired insurance broker, is 71 years old. This group is also the least diverse, with the highest proportion of non-Hispanic white voters, as well as the highest share of male voters. 
What would Larry like on social media? He has very conservative values and has followed and liked pages that are pro-guns and the US Second Amendment. He is loyal first and foremost to the Republican party and whoever represents them, which most recently has been Donald Trump - and likes pages about this. Fox News is the main place this voter group goes for news, according to Pew's data. 
For him, religion is very important in public life. He is an evangelical protestant who is married to a woman and has grown-up children. He has followed several anti-abortion pages and groups.
He doesn't like the federal government having too much power. Instead, he's liked lots of groups and pages about his local area and community in Oneonta, Alabama. He has also followed several US army pages. 
Britney, 50 years old, is the Populist Right character. She votes Republican, but unlike Larry, she's much more critical of big business. She likes some posts on social media opposing billionaires and supporting higher taxes for big corporations. She also follows pages about unfounded conspiracies like the Great Reset and New World Order, which tap into the idea that the very rich are orchestrating a sinister global plot. 
She is very supportive of Trump - and the possibility he'll run for re-election in 2024. Her loyalties lie with him rather than the Republican party itself. 
Populist Right group is overwhelmingly white - but the 54% of voters who fall into this group are female. It is also one of the least highly educated groups with just two in 10 graduating from college. Recently-divorced Britney and her children live in Houston in Texas, where she works as a school secretary and takes part in parent groups online.
Half of this group opposed Covid-19 vaccines - so Britney likes and follows some anti-mask and anti-vaccine content on social media. Like Larry, she is also religious and follows many anti-abortion accounts and pages. Fox News is also where she gets her news, according to research - and it's the outlet she was recommended lots on Twitter when she first signed up. 
Gabriela, 44 years old, is a floating voter - and Pew's research dubs this group Stressed Sideliner. Her views vary and she's not really that interested in politics. She likes music, dance, fashion - and topics that are generally apolitical on social media. 
group is 56% women - and has the highest share of Hispanic voters compared to all the other groups. Gabriela lives with her husband and children in Miami, Florida, and likes and follows pages about her local area, as well as the Hispanic community there. 
About one in four Stressed Sideliners live in lower-income households. Gabriela has liked lots of groups and pages about saving money on monthly shopping. She is a nanny, so has also joined lots of parent groups and others advertising work. 
Her views on social issues vary. According to Pew's research, on abortion, banning guns, legalising marijuana and making university free, Stressed Sideliners align with Democrats. But she's more conservative on the death penalty and supportive of the police. She has liked some pro-choice content.
Michael, 61 years old, is part of the Democratic Mainstay group. This is the most diverse group, with the highest proportion of black voters at 26%. According to Pew's research, three quarters of this group are religious - and it has the highest proportion of black protestant voters. Michael really values faith and family. He's interested in pages linked to churches in his local area, as well as US and black history. 
He's been a committed Democrat for years. He likes lots of pages, groups and accounts linked to the party, as well as popular politicians like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Barack Obama. 
Democratic Mainstays are slightly older and have less formal education than other Democrat-leaning groups. Michael is a teacher in Milwaukee, Wisconsin - where he lives with his wife and kids. 
He is economically more liberal. On social media he follows various teaching unions and charities that help families make ends meet. But he is more moderate on other social issues and is pro-military. He prefers left-leaning news outlets, including CNN.
Emma is the most liberal of all the types - 48% of this group has received a university degree, and most of them are white. Emma attended university and lives in New York City with her girlfriend, where she is a graphic designer. The creative arts are very important to these voters, according to Pew's data. Emma follows accounts about art and film. 
group is made up of younger voters - with a third under 30. They are also the least religious of all of the groups. Emma is 25-years-old and an atheist. 
According to Pew, these voters are likely to get their political news from NPR and The New York Times - which are pages Emma follows. 
Progressive Left voters are very passionate about racial and gender equality - 88% judge there to be serious discrimination against black people. Emma follows lots of accounts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. 
She is also pro-choice and passionate about the environment. Emma likes a variety of pages about intersectional feminism, women's marches and LGBTQI rights, including supporting the transgender community. She follows environmental activists - and she supports the legalisation of marijuana, liking several pages that promote this. 
Emma and Larry are both the most politically engaged according to Pew's research. They voted at the highest rate in the 2020 Presidential election, they post about politics online and they donate to campaigns too.

31-year-old won bronze at his home Olympics at London in 2012, before gaining a silver medal four years later in Rio de Janeiro.
Muhammad says his career has been ""a blast, full of fantastic memories and great achievements"".
He worked as a pundit for the BBC during Tokyo 2020 after not being selected to compete in Team GB.
He said: ""It was a dream come true as a Londoner to win a medal at London 2012, my home city and become the first British man to win an Olympic medal in taekwondo.

politics	Greyhound racing should be banned in Wales, says committee	"About 35,000 people have signed an online petition calling for greyhound racing to be scrapped in Wales.
Greyhound racing could be banned in Wales after a Senedd committee called for it to be gradually outlawed.
A majority of members on the petitions committee agreed with the 35,000 people who signed a petition calling for it to be banned.
Members also called for a review into other sports involving animals.
Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB) said it was ""disappointed"" while the Welsh government said it would consider the recommendation.
re is only one greyhound race track remaining in Wales.
Vanessa Waddon, the owner of Llanharan-based dog charity Hope Rescue, which launched the petition, said she was delighted.
""It has lost its social licence to operate. The public agree that greyhounds deserve our protection.
""They are not collateral damage. We don't want to see dogs injured or dying for sport.""
mmittee's report said the evidence provided by Valley Greyhounds ""suggests the track is no more dangerous than any other"".
Valley Greyhounds in Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly county, is Wales' last remaining greyhound track and hosts meets once a week.
rack has applied to Caerphilly council for planning permission to expand its facilities as part of the bid for a licence from the Greyhound Board for Great Britain.
An initial application for extension to the grandstand and clubhouse was refused last month by the council and a second application is being considered, although no date has been set for a decision.  
Malcolm Tams, manager of Valley Greyhounds said he had plans to open a greyhound re-homing centre at his track.
He said: ""There will be no burden on any rescue centre whatsoever, it will all be dealt with in-house"".
Mr Tams said that he feared banning greyhound racing would force it underground, into so called ""flip meetings"".
He added: ""If you ban greyhound racing, people who still want to race greyhounds will hold flip meetings in fields, like they did years ago, and this will drive it underground. 
""Like the whippets do now and lurchers, they don't race on these tracks, they race in fields - there will be more injuries to greyhounds.""
Hope Rescue claims to have rescued almost 200 dogs associated with Valley Greyhounds since 2018, though the track disputes this.
rity previously worked alongside Valley Greyhounds, but has since adopted a policy calling for all greyhound racing to be banned.
Ms Waddon said the industry was fuelling the breeding of excess dogs that would likely require help from charities in later life, adding pressure to an already-stretched sector.
""Once a dog stops racing, they then need to find a rescue [centre] that can take it in for rehoming,"" she said.
Four of the five members of the committee said they were in favour of a phased ban, with Conservative Member of the Senedd MS Joel James saying he favoured tightening existing regulation instead.
Despite advocating for a ban, the report acknowledged such a move would have a financial impact on the Valleys Greyhounds Stadium and Ystrad Mynach.
It recommended undertaking a widespread consultation before implementing any changes.
GBGB said: ""We are disappointed that four members of the petitions committee are in favour of a ban on greyhound racing in Wales.
""As their report makes very clear in its recommendations, however, there are a number of strong alternatives which would allow the sport to continue in a fully regulated environment, thus protecting the welfare of dogs, the jobs and livelihoods of those involved in the sport and the revenue contribution the sport makes to the economy.""
report added that greyhound racing was ""not the only sport where animals race for the entertainment of humans"" and that all such sports should be looked at.
GBGB said the recommendation was a warning to industries like horse racing, fishing and pigeon racing and their sport was ""the thin end of the wedge"".
Welsh government said: ""Our ambition is for all animals in Wales to have a good quality life.
""We recognised there are concerns relating to the welfare of racing greyhounds and we will give careful consideration to the committee's recommendations."""	/news/uk-wales-63976802
sports	World Para Table Tennis Championships: GB's Felicity Pickard and Grace Williams win gold	"Felicity Pickard and Grace Williams beat top seeds Germany in the women's class 14 doubles to take gold at the World Para Table Tennis Championships.
British pair only started playing together last year but secured a 3-0 victory over the favourites Stephanie Grebe and Juliane Wolf.
feated France in the semi-final on Monday to exceed expectations at the championships in Granada, Spain. 
""I knew we'd get there one day,"" said 28-year-old Pickard.
""But I never thought it would happen so soon. Yesterday was a real breakthrough for us and I knew if we could play the same way again today we had a chance.""
Pickard and Welsh teenager Williams fought back from 9-7 down to take the first set 11-9, before dominating the second set 11-4. 
In the third set, they had two unsuccessful match points at 10-8 but as the game reached 11-10, Grebe's shot flew high into the air to hand Pickard and Williams a 12-10 set victory and the world title. 
Pickard was a singles bronze medallist in Slovenia four years ago but was devastated to miss out on qualification for the Paralympic Games last summer. 
""From where I was just before Tokyo to now is indescribable and I think I can be very proud of myself,"" she said. 
""Not just with how far I've come as an athlete but as a person as well and the way I'm able to communicate and conduct myself within the team. I can be incredibly proud of that.""
Williams, from Llanfyllin in North Wales, was given a wildcard to compete in the world championships and said she expected to play in Spain ""for the experience"". 
""But the fact that I'm here and I've got a gold medal is just surreal and I can't believe it,"" the 19-year-old added. 
Following her doubles success on Wednesday, Pickard's bid to win a singles title in the women's class 6 was ended by Hanna Hammad from Egypt in a 3-2 defeat. 
Williams has to wait until Thursday morning for her first match in the women's class 8 against Aneth Araya from Costa Rica."	/sport/disability-sport/63563446
entertainment	How do you get school pupils interested in poetry?	"As hard sells go, it is us up there with the toughest of all - how do you get school pupils interested in poetry?
Glasgow-based performance poet Imogen Stirling has been on that mission in rural south-west Scotland over the past year or so.
She admitted there had been an element of subterfuge to her work in and around Wigtown.
""I've learned that you just can never use the word poetry because that puts people off immediately,"" she said. 
""And, I mean, rightly so to be honest, I had no interest in poetry when I was in school and I didn't really resonate with the way that it was taught to me at all.
""So it did take me quite a long time from having sort of dipped into poetry at school to come back to it because I really just didn't think it was for me.""
However, there are ways to get it across.
""I think it's more about bringing out the performative elements and the storytelling elements,"" she said.
""We're really fortunate in that there's so many exciting performance poets at the moment.
""There's so many artists who are blending poetry and raps, which is a much more accessible art form, I think.""
She said she tried to showcase some of that work and show students how the spoken word could be used to talk about things which were important to them rather than ending up in ""some dusty book on a shelf"".
""I think it's just about feeling comfortable in your own expression,"" she added.
School visits are one part of her work in the region alongside setting up the Wigtownshire Young Writers Development Programme which helps teenagers from 14 to 18.
""We come together once a month, to work together and help develop their skills as writers,"" she said.
""It is as much about skill development as it is about socialising with other writers and also looking on to see what a career in writing could look like.""
Her own journey into performance poetry has been a circuitous one after studying theatre and literature.
""I'd worked abroad as a musician for a couple of years, came back to Glasgow and found that this really rich performance poetry scene existed, which had never been there to my knowledge when I'd been here studying,"" she said.
""I fell into that and sort of frequented a lot of the open mic nights and that sort of thing around here and then wrote a show for the Fringe in 2018 and it's really kind of been all go since then.""
It has brought her to Wigtown Book Festival this year to perform Love The Sinner which she describes as a ""modern retelling of the stories of the seven deadly sins set as characters in a contemporary Scottish cityscape"".
Who knows, in future, maybe some of her current students will be inspired to follow in her footsteps."	/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-63008193
entertainment	I'm A Celebrity: Olivia Attwood heartbroken over early exit	"Olivia Attwood's team say she is ""heartbroken"" about having had to withdraw from I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! on medical grounds.
Love Island star has appeared in the first two episodes of this series, and was seen skydiving out of a helicopter on Sunday's launch show.
But on Monday, a show spokesman said Attwood had left after medics advised it was not safe for her to continue.
Her team later said fans will ""hear the truth from Olivia in due course"".
A message posted on her behalf to her Instagram page on Monday evening read: ""To say Olivia is heartbroken would be an understatement.
""She dreamed of doing 'I'm a Celeb' for years, and was absolutely loving every second of the show and throwing herself into jungle life feet first (just as we knew she would).
""However, for reasons beyond her control her journey has been cut short.""
V personality and model had entered the jungle alongside the likes of singer Boy George, DJ Chris Moyles and former England sports stars Mike Tindall and Jill Scott in the celebrity jungle on Sunday.
much-publicised arrival of former health secretary Matt Hancock as an extra campmate is expected later this week.
Addressing her two million followers directly, Attwood's team continued: ""Your support and kind words have meant the absolute world to her, now as much as it always has.
""You will hear the truth from Olivia in due course and she will be back on your screens in the New Year.""
Her exit means she has recorded the joint shortest stay in the show's 20-year history, alongside ex-EastEnders and Gimme Gimme Gimme actress Elaine Lordan.
Attwood was seen jumping out of a helicopter on Sunday's episode, while Monday's saw her take part in her first bushtucker trial. 
g-running ITV reality show enjoyed a bump in ratings for its new opening episode on Sunday, compared with 2021's opener in Wales.
An average audience of 9.1 million watched the programme, which returned to Australia for the first time in two years following the pandemic.
Last year's debut, set in a Welsh castle for the second year running, was seen by an average of 8.03m.
Before being made to do a tandem parachute jump out of a helicopter, Attwood was seen giving herself a little pep talk.
""This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,"" she said, jokingly adding: ""Just need to get back on safe ground in one piece, [with] both boobs, all the [dental] veneers, everything.""
After landing safely, she declared it to be ""the most amazing thing I've done ever.""
She had an auspicious start to her short time on the show, as she and Boy George were voted for by the public as jungle VIPs. But this turned out to mean Very Isolated Person, rather than Very Important Person.
""I am equal parts flattered and unnerved the public voted for me to be a VIP,"" she said, on discovering the news.
Attwood and Boy George were joined by their chosen guests, Moyles and TV presenter Scarlette Douglas, with the foursome having to stay marooned on an island outside the camp for their first night, which also turned out to be Attwood's last.
Attwood, who has also appeared on The Only Way Is Essex, last year fronted the documentary Getting Filthy Rich, exploring the world of people ""selling sex"" online.
31-year-old had previous experience of bush tucker trials, having appeared on I'm A Celebrity's spin-off show, Extra Camp, where she was made to eat sheep brains. 
But she exited the main show after taking part in just one trial, named HMS Drown Under, during which she was heard screaming while trying to quickly locate taps situated inside a series of ""hell holes"" in order to save her team from drowning.
At the start of Monday's episode, presenter Declan Donnelly explained to viewers: ""Unfortunately, Olivia Attwood has left the jungle for medical reasons and sadly won't be returning.""
""Now, she does feature in tonight's show, which was filmed before she had to leave,"" added his co-host Ant McPartlin. ""We're very sad to see her go and we wish her well.""
Ahead of the show, a spokesman confirmed Attwood's departure, stating: ""As a precautionary measure Olivia needed to leave the jungle to undergo some medical checks,"" a show spokesman told the BBC on Monday.
""Unfortunately, the medical team has advised it is not safe for Olivia to return to camp as there needs to be further investigation.
""She has been absolutely brilliant and she'll be very much missed on the show."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63541438
entertainment	Megan Thee Stallion: Jury finds Tory Lanez guilty of shooting rapper	"Rapper Tory Lanez has been found guilty of shooting fellow hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion in 2020.
A jury in Los Angeles convicted the 30-year-old Canadian of felony negligent discharge of a firearm, assault with a semi-automatic firearm, and carrying a loaded and unregistered firearm.
He faces more than 20 years in prison.
Megan Thee Stallion, a 27-year-old Grammy-winning rapper, earlier testified that she was shot in the feet after leaving a pool party.
Lanez showed no reaction as the verdict was read out. He was remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on 27 January.
It was not immediately known whether he planned to appeal.
Speaking after the case concluded, one of Megan Thee Stallion's lawyers told reporters ""the jury got it right. I am thankful there is justice for Meg"". The rapper was not in court to hear the verdict.
During the trial, Megan Thee Stallion, whose real name is Megan Pete, testified that she was shot and wounded at the party in the Hollywood Hills on 12 July 2020.
rapper argued that Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, became enraged after she had disparaged his musical talent. She said she had demanded to be let out of a luxury car before he fired five rounds at her.
She told the jury the Canadian had told her to ""dance"" before opening fire.
She also testified that he had offered her $1m (Â£830,000) to keep quiet about the attack because he claimed to be on probation for a weapons offence. She initially said to police that she had cut her feet on glass.
Lanez denied the charges relating to a dispute with the fellow artist and his lawyer, George Mgdesyan, unsuccessfully argued that the investigation had been botched.
He said it was Megan Thee Stallion's friend Kelsey Harris who had shot her, adding that it was all about ""jealousy"". 
Several bullet fragments were removed from Megan Thee Stallion's feet after the shooting, but some remain.
She also acknowledged in her testimony that she had been ""intimate"" with Lanez.

entertainment	N-Dubz cancel show 'at the last minute' after support acts perform	"Fans were left angry and disappointed after N-Dubz cancelled a show ""at the very last minute"" after their support acts had performed.
rt, at the Motorpoint Arena in Nottingham, was part of the group's The Back To The Future tour following their recent return after 11 years.
One fan said she felt ""mugged off"" by the cancellation.
N-Dubz apologised but said singer Dappy had been advised by doctors to rest and would be unable to perform.
Hours before the show, Dappy posted on his Instagram story that his voice was ""basically gone"" as a result of doing ""too many shows back to back"".
In a separate story post, he later said: ""I'm so sorry Nottingham.""
But the cancellation was not confirmed by the venue until fans had watched the support acts, with an announcement displayed on a large screen on the main stage.
N-Dubz has since announced the concert has been rescheduled for 7 December at the same venue. 
Katie Simpson, 21, from Nottingham, said she felt ""mugged off"" by the group, adding the atmosphere became ""really scary"" after the announcement. 
""Everyone was fuming, they were throwing drinks on the stage and pouring beer everywhere,"" she said.
""There was fighting and people were goingÂ up to the stewards to ask what was going on.Â  
""They literally let us down five minutes before they were coming on. They've taken the absolute mick out of us.""
Ms Simpson has called for a refund after the cancellation, saying she would not want to go to a rescheduled performance.  
Nottinghamshire Police said officers had not received any reports of disturbances. 
A Motorpoint Arena spokesperson added some social media reports of disturbances were ""wholly inaccurate"". 
""There was no major crowd disorder, the police were not needed nor present on site, and there was no criminal damage to any vehicles or the venue itself,"" the spokesperson said.
""In fact, despite their extreme disappointment and frustration, almost everyone behaved very well and we would like to thank our customers for their calm response.""
Some social media users had described the cancellation as ""appalling"" and a ""joke"".
Others asked why organisers had allowed fans to arrive and the other acts to go ahead if they had been aware of Dappy's condition.

sports	Jamie Chadwick to race in Indy NXT for Andretti Autosport in 2023	"Britain's Jamie Chadwick will race in the United States' Indy NXT series for the Andretti Autosport team in 2023.
24-year-old won her third W Series title in October after the final three races were cancelled because of funding issues.
Indy NXT is the second tier of the USA's open-wheel racing format IndyCar, which includes the Indy 500 oval race.
""My aim is always to challenge myself and continue my progression,"" said Chadwick.
""This represents not only a big step up but also a big step towards my goal of competing in the highest categories of single-seater racing.""
Chadwick's drive, in what was previously known as IndyLights, is a step up in speed from the W Series and includes 14 races - two of which are on traditional American oval circuits, notoriously tricky for drivers from Europe as they require a different style of racing.
She arrives with significant new funding for the season - from long-time F1 supporter DHL - after previous support did not materialise as hoped in 2020.
Chadwick, who won $500,000 (Â£409,000) for the W Series title, is aiming to become the first female driver to compete in a Formula 1 grand prix since Lella Lombardi in 1976. 
Britain's Susie Wolff took part in an F1 practice session for Williams at the British and German GPs in 2014.
Chadwick said: ""I've followed IndyCar over the years, and it definitely is something I'd love to race in. I've not looked that far ahead yet.
""But there's other opportunities as well in the States - not just single-seater racing, but in sports cars, as well as Formula 2 and Formula 3 - with Formula 1 being the ultimate goal.
""But it's important at this stage to focus purely on my development.""
Chadwick, who is a development driver for the Williams F1 team but does not drive the current F1 car, must amass 40 'super-licence' points to qualify to compete in F1.
She currently has 15 from winning the 2021 W Series, but cannot earn any more points in the 2022 championship.
She can win a maximum of 15 by winning the Indy NXT title.
Andretti Autosport is run by former IndyCar champion and McLaren F1 driver Michael Andretti, son of 1978 F1 world champion Mario.
Andretti Autosport have won the Indy 500 five times and the IndyCar championship four - twice each through Britons Dario Franchitti and the late Dan Wheldon."	/sport/motorsport/63382111
entertainment	Strictly Come Dancing: Hamza's Wellingborough School 'very proud'	"2022 Strictly Come Dancing winner's former school has said he has been a ""huge inspiration"" to its pupils.
BBC wildlife presenter, Hamza Yassin, 32, who attended the private Wellingborough School in Northamptonshire 2004-2008, lifted the glitterball trophy on Saturday.
Head teacher Andrew Holman said he was a ""legend"" and said the school was ""very proud"". 
Yassin previously said he ""would be nowhere"" without the school.
's website said Yassin originally pursued a medical degree after leaving before switching to zoology, followed by reading for a master's degree in biological photography and imaging.
As one of Britain's up and coming wildlife photographers, he made appearances on BBC's The One Show and programmes such as Animal Park, Countryfile and Springwatch before being invited to front his own show on the CBeebies channel, Let's Go For A Walk, in which Ranger Hamza takes children on rambles.
Now living in a remote part of the west Scottish mainland, in December 2019, he went to Antarctica to film for a new season of Sir David Attenborough's The Frozen Planet.
Yassin, who had never had any dance lessons before taking part in the BBC's 14-week entertainment programme, beat Molly Rainford, Fleur East and Helen Skelton in the final, with viewers enjoying the non-dancer's progress.
Mr Holman, who joined the school in 2018, said he had spoken to a few staff who had known him and said ""what you saw on the TV is what he was like"".
""He was very down to earth, very rounded and wore his heart on his sleeve,"" he said.
""He was very new to the area as his family had only recently moved from Sudan, but he settled in quickly and was willing to give things a go and get stuck in, which is what he has done on Strictly and we are very proud.""
He said the former pupil had shown what they try to instil in their pupils every day.
""We always say think big, think what you can achieve and give it a go, you never know what will happen, and that's what we've seen in the past three months,"" he said.
""It's about having a can-do attitude.""
Hamza had been a ""huge inspiration"" to the school and that everyone was very excited knowing that he had once walked its corridors and classrooms.
""There are so many inspirational people, but as a pupil here, seeing someone who has come from where they are and have a job that they love and other strings to their bow, it's just wonderful,"" he said.
""You can't ask for a better role model.
""They say 'you can't be what you can't see' but this is the other way round, 'you can be what you can see' and the pupils think 'that could be me'.
""Learning to dance like that in just three months is a massive achievement and will be the subject of many head teacher assemblies.""
He added that it was now their ""absolute dream"" for Yassin to attend their summer school prize giving.
""Everybody wants a bit of Hamza at the moment, but we've been giving him a lot of shout-outs on social media throughout the series and to perk him up before the final, so you never know,"" he said.
Unusually, the school can actually boast two Strictly contestants as the Reverend Richard Coles, who attended the school in the 1980s, took part in the 2017 dancing contest.
Less successful than Hamza, the former Communard was the second celebrity to be voted off that year.
Apart from stage schools, Mr Holman thinks they are probably the only mainstream school to claim that double, but he is prepared to be corrected.
""It's not normally a thing that a school celebrates but it shows our pupils have a certain creativity and can think outside the box,"" he said.

health	Cavell Centre: 'Profound sense of fear' felt among staff	"A ""profound sense of fear"" existed among staff at an NHS mental health unit where leadership was described as dictatorial, a report has found.
An internal review into the culture of the Cavell Centre, in Peterborough, found staff who spoke up felt ""ostracised and alienated"".
It added that ""staff likened the Cavell Centre to a school playground where the school bully operates"".
NHS trust said it was ""deeply shocked and saddened by the findings"".
unit, run by Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Trust (CPFT), provides inpatient mental health care and specialist learning disability services.
CPFT commissioned the review in November 2021, but the reviewers said many of those they interviewed ""were extremely anxious"" about taking part, and were in fear of being identified.
Released to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act after a request in September, the review said: ""A cyclical theme within the culture of the Cavell Centre was reported as autocratic, dictatorial, insular, and hierarchical."" 
It found that behaviour by ""key people in the hierarchy"" led to ""acts that could reasonably constitute bullying or harassment"".
Reviewers heard ""very distressing testimony relating to sexuality, of staff being confronted with extremely offensive and discriminatory messages"".
Other findings included claims of racism from both white and non-white staff, and concerns care was being compromised because of a culture of nurse-led, rather than consultant-led, decision-making.
Staff also described it as ""a place bereft of hope or enthusiasm"", and public humiliation ""came across as a norm of leadership"".
Reviewers, who conducted interviews between January and May, said staff ""required multiple reassurances that speaking with the reviewers was safe and confidential"". 
""The profound sense of fear expressed by some staff was tangible and real,"" the review said.
""Many explained how they or their colleagues had been ostracised and alienated for doing so, feeling that the only solution was to leave.""
In October, the same month the review was published, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspected the Cavell Centre and four wards at Fulbourn Hospital as part of an inspection into CPFT's acute wards for adults of working age and psychiatric intensive care.
In May, an inspection of one of those Fulbourn wards - prompted by an allegation of sexual assault - led to the CQC serving the trust a warning notice, which has been lifted since the most recent inspection.
But this inspection, in direct contrast to the trust's own review, also said ""staff felt respected, supported and valued... they could raise any concerns without fear"".
CQC said it had spoken to 11 staff across the five units and was ""satisfied the culture did not undermine patient safety"". 
But it added: ""After our inspection concluded, the trust made us aware of the independent review and it subsequently shared the associated report. 
""We are taking up the issues the review raises with the trust to seek assurances these concerns do not undermine the quality or safety of patient care.""
Anna Hills, CPFT chief executive, said: ""We commissioned the cultural review in response to concerns from our staff and are deeply shocked and saddened by the findings.
""I would like to thank colleagues who bravely came forward to speak up and I am truly sorry for what they have experienced.
""Since receiving the report we have spent time listening to and talking with staff, and together we are co-designing the next steps.
""The trust board is fully committed to addressing the issues raised.""
With respect to the CQC inspection she was ""pleased [it] acknowledged the improvements that have already taken place"", adding: ""We recognise there is still work to do but I am so very proud of the dedication of our staff.""

entertainment	Lizzo plays 200-year-old flute owned by former US president	"US star Lizzo wowed fans during a concert on Tuesday in Washington DC when she took to the stage to play a 200-year-old crystal flute, once owned by former US President James Madison.
ger and trained flautist was granted permission by The Library of Congress to play the instrument, which arrived on stage with a police escort.
Inspecting it on stage, she said: ""It's like playing out of a wine glass.""
She then played a few notes while simultaneously shaking her lower body.
""I just twerked and played James Madison's flute from the 1800s!"" she beamed, after having handed it back to a representative who put it back in its case.
While posting the video on her own social media channels afterwards, the Houston-raised Juice singer told her fans: ""No one has ever heard what is sounds like... now you do.""
She later added: ""As a flute player this is iconic and I will never be over it."" 
A spokesperson for the Library of Congress told the BBC that the flute may have been played in public on a rare special occasion in the past, most likely in Madison's time.
Until Lizzo picked up the flute, the Library's curator, who has worked at the Library since 1993, had never heard it played live.
Following her historic gig on Tuesday evening, The Library of Congress tweeted to confirm the flute had been returned safely.
""We just did a DNA test,"" they posted. ""Turns out: It's 100% that [crystal] flute"" - a play on words with the lyrics from Lizzo's hit song Truth Hurts.
Grammy-winner Lizzo is currently touring the US in support of her fourth album, Special, which featured the TikTok hit, About Damn Time.
Earlier this summer, she changed the lyrics to a new song, Grrrls, after fans complained it used an ableist slur.
James Madison, America's fourth President from 1809 to 1817, made a major contribution to the ratification of the Constitution by writing The Federalist Papers, along with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In later years, he was referred to as the Father of the Constitution."	/news/entertainment-arts-63058818

business	Call for business support amid recession fears	"Scotland's business leaders have called for more support in the face of the bleak economic outlook.
Bank of England has increased interest rates to 1.75% and warned inflation is now set to hit more than 13%.
Retail and licence trade associations said more UK and Scottish government support is needed ahead of an expected recession.
Scottish government has said its focus is on supporting the lowest paid. 
Latest data from the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) showed footfall in July was 16.5% down on pre-pandemic levels and 0.7% worse than in June.
was larger than the UK average of 14.2%.
ummer heatwave, rail strikes and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis were all blamed.
Ewan MacDonald-Russell, head of policy at the SRC, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""As the year progresses, there is little evidence Scottish consumers are close to returning to pre-pandemic shopping patterns.
""The reality is big ticket items are down and we know people are trading down from premium goods to value goods and cutting back on spending now.
""We need action to tackle the high business rates burden and measures to help consumers, particularly less affluent consumers.""
Mr MacDonald-Russell added that ""big and punchy"" moves to help consumers were needed, adding there was no room for ""half measures""in the UK government's autumn budget.
Meanwhile, a survey of 100 businesses by the Night Time Industries Association Scotland has found 38% respondents were ""unsure"" whether they will survive the next 12 months due to soaring costs. 
majority are trading below 2019 levels of business. 
Colin Wilkinson, managing director of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA), said this pressure was being felt across the hospitality sector and described the Bank of England's interest rate hike as ""very unwelcome"". 
He said: ""The sector continues to see a slow recovery from the pandemic and then the cost of living crisis. 
""This interest rate increase could simply be too much for our smaller operators. 
""The industry benefited greatly from the VAT cut in the pandemic and Eat Out To Help Out was successful. We don't have that now so we'd like to see a cut in VAT for the licensee hospitality sector and a complete review of the business rates.""
Scottish government business minister Ivan McKee said he was ""continuing to call on the UK government to support the lowest paid in our communities"". 
He added: ""The Scottish government has put in about Â£3bn worth of support for low paid families and we would call on the UK government to do something similar.
""VAT is a reserved matter for the UK government and we've asked they consider options there to be able to support businesses at this difficult time.""
Mr McKee said the Scottish government had put ""significant support"" into the business rates system to help businesses through the pandemic. 
On the calls for more support for the hospitality sector, a Treasury spokesman said the UK government had ""stood behind the hospitality sector throughout the pandemic with a Â£400bn package of economy-wide support that saved millions of jobs and offered a lifeline to thousands of night-time businesses up and down the country.""
He added: ""At the Spring Statement we went further, announcing a Â£1,000 increase to the Employment Allowance which will cut taxes for thousands of bars, clubs and venues in Scotland."" "	/news/uk-scotland-62434365
health	Leprosy: Ancient disease able to regenerate organs	"Leprosy bacteria may hold the secret to safely repairing and regenerating the body, researchers at the University of Edinburgh say. 
Animal experiments have uncovered the bacteria's remarkable ability to almost double the size of livers by stimulating healthy growth. 
It is a sneakily selfish act that gives the bacteria more tissue to infect. 
But working out how they do it could lead to new age-defying therapies, the scientists say.
Leprosy causes disability when it infects the nerves, skin and eyes. 
roughout history, those infected have been shunned. 
But the bacterium that causes it, Mycobacterium leprae, has other, unusual properties, including the ability to perform ""biological alchemy"", converting one type of bodily tissue into another, which are fascinating scientists.
So the researchers turned to another animals that catches the disease - armadillos. 
xperiments, which were performed in the US, showed the infection heads to the armoured animals' livers, where it performed a controlled hijacking of the organ to reprogram it for its own purpose. 
""It was totally unexpected,"" Prof Anura Rambukkana, from the University of Edinburgh's centre for regenerative medicine, told me.
results, published in Cell Reports Medicine, showed the liver nearly doubled in size. 
You might expect such growth to be defective or even cancerous - but detailed analysis showed it was both healthy and functional, complete with the usual array of blood vessels and bile ducts. 
""It is kind of mind-blowing,"" Prof Rambukkana said. ""How do they do that? There is no cell therapy that can do that."" 
It appears the leprosy bug is rewinding the developmental clock in the liver. 
Fully grown liver cells are metabolic powerhouses with hundreds of jobs in the body. 
But the bacteria are taking them back a stage - like becoming a teenager again - where they can rapidly increase in number before maturing back into adulthood.
Interrogating the activity of different parts of the cells' DNA revealed a picture more akin to that of a much younger animal or even a fetus, when the liver is still forming. 
But the precise details of how this is all happening remain elusive. 
Nobel Prize-winning research has shown it is possible to forcibly turn the clock all the way back to the point at which cells regain the ability to become any other type of cell in the body - but this runs the risk of turning them cancerous. 
""The [leprosy] bugs use alternative pathways,"" Prof Rambukkana told me. 
""It's a much safer way and they take a longer time to do that, so this is a natural process."" 
roach can be harnessed for repairing the livers of people waiting for a transplant - or even to reverse some of the damage caused by ageing elsewhere in the body. 
""The dream is to use the same bacterial strategy, to use the ingenuity of bacteria to generate new medicines for regeneration and repair,"" Prof Rambukkana said.
""If you can harness that, you should be able to turn that mechanism into a jab you have every three months or something.""
All these ideas remain untested, however.
Dr Darius Widera, of the University of Reading, said: ""Overall, the results could pave the way for new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of liver diseases such as cirrhosis.
""However, as the research has been done using armadillos as model animals, it is unclear if and how these promising results can translate to the biology of the human liver.  
""Moreover, as the bacteria used in this study are disease-causing, substantial refinement of the methods would be required prior to clinical translation.""

business	UK hiring slowing down amid economic uncertainty	"Hiring in the UK has slowed amidst uncertainty over the economy, according to a report.
July saw the slowest increase in the number of permanent jobs filled for 17 months.
KPMG said recruiters are becoming more tentative over hiring new staff.
ultancy added that ongoing skills shortages, a drop in foreign workers and hesitancy from candidates to move jobs had all led to a tighter supply of suitable staff.
wing down of the hiring spree that followed the pandemic comes as the Bank of England warned the UK will fall into recession in the final quarter of this year. The bank raised interest rates from 1.25% to 1.75%, in a bid to curb soaring prices.
jobs report by KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation suggested rising operating costs and uncertainty over the UK's economic outlook is leading some firms to put the brakes on recruitment, at least for permanent roles.
But the soaring cost of living and tougher competition for a smaller pool of qualified candidates has also meant that the rate of starting pay continued to rise in July. 
""The trend of uncertainty in the UK jobs market of the last few months continues,"" said KPMG's Claire Warnes. 
""Employers are rightly hesitant about their hiring plans... So, a focus on up-skilling existing workers and attracting talent, remains absolutely essential for UK business to play its part in driving forward the economy.""
It is still a good time to be a jobseeker - the number of vacancies advertised has continued to grow. Although the fastest rate of growth in vacancies was for temporary posts in the hospitality sector.
""Given the outlook being painted by the Bank of England... one might wonder why anyone would consider switching jobs at all,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
""Consumer confidence is already at record lows, and prices look set to rise further, so business and consumers are likely to face further challenges. Let's see what the government has in mind to help navigate us through the winter months.""
Bank of England said it expects the economy to shrink in the final three months of this year, and keep shrinking until the end of 2023, signalling the longest downturn for the UK economy since the 2008 financial crisis.
Jeevun Sandher, economist at Kings College London said ""those who are able and willing to work are, generally, working. That is great news"". But he added: ""The problem we face is that having a job does not mean you will earn enough to escape poverty. Even before this cost-of-living crisis, almost 70% of adults in poverty lived in working households. That has gotten significantly worse - half of us are now cutting back on food."" 
He added that workers should be asking for ""the highest salaries possible""."	/news/business-62423709

ularity of K-pop has continued to spread with bands topping the UK album chart in the past three years.
""Seeing it grow and be able to have a place to go and buy my albums is really special,"" one fan, Hannah, said.
KPOPPINUK, which claims to be the first dedicated K-pop shop in Birmingham, held a photo-trading-card event on 4 December to allow fans to meet friends and buy merchandise.

politics	What can we expect from Rishi Sunak as prime minister?	"BBC finds itself criticised now and again for broadcasting too many repeats. 
So perhaps I should apologise, for it's just seven weeks to the day since I popped up on the telly and radio to look ahead to a new prime minister assuming office. 
Leading a fractious party, at a time of economic gloom, a war in Europe and without a mandate to call their own from the electorate. 
And here we go again. 
Except this time Rishi Sunak inherits all this as well as the extra challenge of the fallout of the insurrection against his predecessor Liz Truss. 
Senior figures in government don't dispute that her vision, its near instant collapse and its consequences left the UK an international laughing stock. 
So enter the latest new prime minister.
fifth in a little over six years.
rd of this year.
rd in two months.
I know people like me keep wanging on about these kind of numbers.
We do because it is astonishing and utterly unprecedented. 
So what can we expect now? 
We heard much from Mr Sunak over the summer when he was standing for the leadership the first time around - where his key message was that Liz Truss's economic prospectus would be a disaster.
On that, he will be able to claim vindication.
But since that campaign much has changed - not least because of the consequences of Ms Truss's set of policies over the last few months.
And one of the many oddities of the last few weeks was a leadership race done at breakneck speed - start to finish in four days - in which we didn't hear a thing in public from two of the three wannabes.
Penny Mordaunt did give an interview to Laura Kuenssberg - but committed to little.
Boris Johnson said nothing.
And Mr Sunak said no more than the contents of a social media post saying he was in the running.
He has since addressed activists at Conservative HQ, but reporters weren't allowed in to ask questions. 
So much is yet to be revealed about how he'll govern and what his priorities will be.
His first big public moment will be at the recently much-used Downing Street lectern at just after 11:30 BST. 
It's the moment when all new prime ministers talk to the country and talk to the archive - the moment that will get played back weeks, months or years later when they leave and will be used to benchmark a point in history, if they're lucky. 
Mr Sunak has already emphasised the importance of ""integrity"" and ""humility"" - which sounds like he's trying to draw a contrast between his approach and how many perceived, respectively, his two (very) immediate predecessors. 
And then it'll be time to shape a government in his own image, while seeking to address the criticism levelled by many at Ms Truss for building an administration that froze out almost all supporters of Mr Sunak. 
Another thing being emphasised is the need for stability. 
Little wonder after the last few weeks.
But how does he achieve both of these things at once?
Were he to change home secretary, we'd have our third in a week.
Were he to change chancellor, we'd have our third in a few weeks.

And this for a party blamed by many for what's happened in the last few months, and one that is currently languishing in a desperate spot in the opinion polls.

technology	Google and Microsoft hit by slowing economy	"Sales at the tech giants Alphabet and Microsoft have slowed sharply, adding to fears of a downturn in the economy.
Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, said sales rose just 6% in the three months to September, to $69bn, as firms cut their advertising budgets. 
It marked the US firm's weakest quarterly growth in nearly a decade outside of the start of the pandemic.
Microsoft meanwhile said demand for its computers and other technology had weakened.
Its sales rose by 11% to $50.1bn, marking its slowest revenue growth in five years. 
Consumers and businesses around the world are cutting back as prices rise and interest rates go up, fuelling fears of a global recession. 
A strong US dollar has also hurt American multinationals, making it more expensive to sell products abroad.
Profits at Alphabet dropped nearly 30% to $13.9bn in the quarter, as YouTube ad revenues declined for the first time since the firm started to report them publicly.
Sales growth at the firm has slowed for five consecutive quarters.
Boss Sundar Pichai said that Alphabet was ""sharpening"" its focus and ""being responsive to the economic environment"".
""When Google stumbles, it's a bad omen for digital advertising at large,"" said Evelyn Mitchell, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, noting that Google's core website has in the past been more resilient to ad spending downturns than social media sites like Facebook or Snap. 
""This disappointing quarter for Google signifies hard times ahead if market conditions continue to deteriorate.""
Microsoft said it expected demand for its PC and cloud computing technology to continue falling this year as business customers cut back.
Sales in its Xbox video game business have also slumped. 
Big tech firms saw their sales jump in the pandemic as locked-down consumers and workers came to rely more on their technology. But the sector's fortunes look bleaker in the current climate. 
In recent months, Alphabet has said it was slowing hiring, while Microsoft has cut jobs.
Many other tech companies have decided to lay off staff, including Netflix and Twitter, or slow the pace of recruitment, such as social media platform Snap.
