business	Germany beer bottle shortage: Industry warns of 'tense' situation	"German breweries are warning there could be a shortage of beer bottles this summer amid rising production costs and a shortage of lorry drivers.
uation is ""extremely tense"", the chief executive of the German Brewers' Federation told German newspaper Bild.
rtage of glass bottles will mainly affect small- and medium-sized breweries, an industry expert said.
Brewers are having to pay 80% more for new glass bottles than they did a year ago. The cost of beer is also rising.
One of the reasons behind the shortage is a hike in energy prices which is causing the price of glass bottle production to increase, a glass industry spokesperson told Bild.
In addition, Holger Eichele of the German Brewers' Federation said a lack of lorry drivers was making it harder to maintain supply chains. 
As a result, he said the cost of new glass bottles had nearly doubled in the last year. 
It follows warnings that the cost of German beer could rise by up to 30%, also due largely to the increase in energy prices. 
rtage of bottles is likely to hit smaller breweries the hardest, because the bigger companies are typically supplied first. 
Mr Eichele said the best thing Germans could do was to return glass bottles to retailers as quickly as possible, advising consumers not to ""hoard empties in the basement"".
Glass bottles, which are common in Germany, are sold with a small deposit, and beer drinkers are expected to bring them back to the shop when getting their next round.
Cans, used elsewhere in the world, are far less common and many breweries use customised bottles that are tricky to replace."	/news/world-europe-61490433
business	Peterborough city market trader says 'it's good to be back'	"A market trader has said ""it's good to be back"" in a new city home after stalls were moved from another site.
Stephen Wetherill relocated to Bridge Street, Peterborough, after the former Northminster site was sold for redevelopment.
Param Singh, a former stall holder, said the new venue was not suitable for him and having to find a new place was ""traumatic"". 
Peterborough City Council said the new ""fantastic"" site had ""high footfall"".
Mr Wetherill, who has been a trader for decades, said: ""The old regulars, who came every week, they're so pleased to see us back. 
""We're trying to provide a service for the public, what they need and that's what market traders are all about.""
However, Mr Singh, who used to run Small World from the Northminster site, said the new site did not fit his business so he moved to The Metro Centre in Woodston. 
His family has traded in the city for three generations and ""it's been something I thought would last forever"". 
More than 300 new homes are to be built on the former site where the marked moved out in March and the Food Hall in May. 
w market was due to open in June, but due to a number of delays traders began setting up in late August and it was fully open by early September, the authority said.
Food Hall, on Bridge Street opened between the end of May and 1 June.
Conservative deputy leader councillor Steve Allen said although some traders were worried about potential rent increases, it was ""a commercial reality that rents do go up"".
""You have to try harder to trade better to earn more money to pay the rents,"" he added.
Shoppers told the BBC the new site was ""convenient"" but it had ""changed the whole character of the city centre"".
uncil said it was ""delighted that the city market is finally open, and the relocation is complete"".
""Bridge Street is a fantastic location with high footfall - especially now the new university has opened and the soon-to-open Hilton Garden Inn Hotel and government hub,"" it added.

business	Cost of living: Small garages want petrol prices cut at chains	"Independent garages are calling on big chains to slash petrol prices as the cost of living crisis continues. 
RAC figures show unleaded dropped nearly 9p in July to 182.69p per litre, while diesel fell almost 7p to 192.38p.
Wrexham's Plas Acton Garage has dropped petrol below 167p, claiming it makes just pennies in profit on each litre.
Energy industry expert Carol Bell said drivers could expect petrol prices to fall as the effect of higher prices on global demand began to take hold. 
Plas Acton's Marcus Ansloos said: ""Unfortunately the bigger people in the industry haven't been bringing their prices down. 
""With us doing this, it has forced everybody in north Wales to start looking at these prices and bringing them down.
""We are literally having a tanker delivering every day of the week to our forecourt and we are selling out on a daily basis, so it is sustainable.""
Wholesale prices peaked at the start of June, but have fallen with oil costs while recession fears in the US and elsewhere have hit demand for oil. 
rice of Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil - has slipped to about $100 a barrel, after soaring when Russia invaded Ukraine.
Abergavenny's Bailey's Garage said it had cut prices in line with falling fuel costs, dropping them to 167.9p a litre on Friday.
Ian Bailey said: ""Because we're independent, we get the prices every morning. We work on a margin and we tap that in and that's what we sell it for.""
Because chains buy in bulk, there is a time gap between the price of oil dropping and their selling off old stock.
Mr Bailey said: ""The supermarkets are on a one-month lag, so when we were most expensive seven weeks ago, they had the old stock they could sell cheaper.
""But now since they've still got the old stock, they have to sell it dearer.""
RAC warned reductions at many pumps still did not fairly reflect the drop in fuel's wholesale price.
Dr Bell said: ""When the price of diesel and petrol in a garage will change typically is when the garage owner receives a bulk delivery.
""So, there'll be a lag. If the tanks are fuller in the garage, then they will be charging a margin on what they've paid for it in the first place.""
She added that it was a comparatively thin margin for garages of about 10%, once VAT, duty and costs of bringing fuel in were included."	/news/uk-wales-62412616
business	Fuel prices: Filling a diesel car now costs a record £100	"Filling the tank of a diesel car now typically costs more than £100 after fuel prices hit record levels.
rage price of diesel in the UK rose to 182.59p a litre on Sunday, according to the AA.
At the same time, petrol hit a new record of 172.73p a litre, it said.
rises mean drivers will pay more at the pump ahead of half-term getaways or trips over the four-day Platinum Jubilee bank holiday which begins on Thursday.
Filling the average 55-litre tank with diesel costs £100.42 and petrol £95, the AA said.
RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: ""With crude oil prices consistently above $115 a barrel last week, worse is sadly yet to come, just in time for the Jubilee bank holiday"".
He said petrol was now more expensive than diesel to wholesalers, so retailers were taking smaller margins on petrol but larger ones on diesel.
""If the wholesale price of petrol stays above diesel, we ought to see the current 10p-a-litre gap in average petrol and diesel forecourt prices narrow,"" he said.
""If this doesn't happen diesel drivers will be getting a raw deal, and with prices at these historic highs, every penny matters to drivers.""
rice of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - has soared in recent months, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised concerns of potential global supply issues.
Fuel prices had already been rising after economies reopened from coronavirus lockdowns, prompting a surge in demand.
A month ago, diesel across the UK averaged 176.47p a litre and 131.64p a litre a year ago, the AA said. Meanwhile petrol a month ago cost an average of 162.40p a litre and 129.31p a year ago, it added.
""With the cost of filling up now above £100, what had once been a 'dash for diesel' among UK car owners is rapidly becoming the death of diesel,"" said Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on pump prices.
""Diesel's new record price is the latest nail in the coffin of the diesel car, after it had been demonised for its emissions in an urban environment. 
""However, a diesel car's 15%-20% better fuel consumption compared to a petrol equivalent out on the open road means less CO2 emissions and would make it more attractive were it not for the current higher cost of refuelling,"" Mr Bosdet said."	/news/business-61637028
business	Bangladesh cuts school and office hours to save power	"Bangladesh will close schools for one more day each week and reduce office hours to ease an electricity shortage, a government official says.
Last month, the South Asian nation started daily two-hour power cuts.
Protesters have taken to the streets in recent weeks after the government raised petrol prices by more than 50%.
war in Ukraine has driven up the cost of importing fuel and taken a toll on Bangladesh's economy and foreign currency reserves.
On Monday, Bangladesh Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam said that schools - which were previously only closed on Fridays - would now also be shut on Saturdays.
Under normal circumstances, schools in Bangladesh are open for six days a week - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.
Meanwhile, government offices and banks will have their opening hours cut to seven hours a day, instead of eight hours. However, private offices will be allowed to set their own operating hours, Mr Islam said.
He added that the government would continue to provide power to villages, including in the early hours of the morning when crops are irrigated.
Many parts of Bangladesh are known to go without electricity for more than two hours a day.
untry generates most of its electricity from natural gas, some of which it imports. 
Officials have shut down all of the country's diesel-driven power plants, which account for around 6% of Bangladesh's electricity generation, because of the rising cost of fuel imports.
Earlier this month, petrol prices were raised by more than 50%, with the cost of the fuel rising from 86 taka a litre (90 US cents, 76p) to 130 taka.
At the same time the price of diesel and kerosene went up by more than 40%.
In July, Bangladesh became the third South Asian nation to seek a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), after Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
While the size of the potential loan has not yet been decided, talks are expected to begin after the IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings in October.
Bangladesh's foreign currency reserves have dwindled to around $40bn (£34bn) or four and a half months of typical government spending.
In recent years, the $416bn economy has been lauded as one of the fastest-growing in the world.

business	UK battery firm staff agree to November pay cut	"Staff at the UK battery firm Britishvolt have agreed to take a ""significant"" pay cut as the company battles to stay afloat.
future of the start-up was thrown into doubt over fears it could run out of money after the government rejected a £30m advance in funding on Monday.
But the firm has raised enough money from an unnamed investor to keep going until early December.
make the money go further around 300 staff will take a pay cut for November. 
Executives at the firm will not take any pay at all for the month.
Britishvolt, which has been championed by the government, wants to build a factory in Blyth in Northumberland, which would build batteries for electric vehicles but has struggled to find investors.
£3.8bn plant had been expected to create 3,000 jobs but has already been delayed several times, which has led to doubts over whether it will become a reality.
government had committed £100m in total to Britishvolt for the project but when the firm on Monday wanted to draw down a third of the cash early, ministers refused.
BBC understands that the firm had to meet set milestones, including attracting a certain level of funding from the private sector, to be able to access the government grant.
Since early September, the firm has had 26 meetings with government officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
As first reported by the Financial Times, Britishvolt will now spend the next five weeks trying to find long-term funding. If it fails it will face the renewed prospect of bankruptcy before Christmas.
Britishvolt chairman Peter Rolton told the Financial Times he was ""confident"" the company would be able to raise the cash in time. 
""We're nudging along, we are improving the position, but the interest is definitely there,"" he told the newspaper.
FT said the sum raised on Tuesday was in the ""single-digit"" millions of pounds, according to sources, adding that Britishvolt previously said it needed to raise £200m to keep the business running until next summer.
In a statement, the company said it was exploring ""both short and long-term funding streams"" to build its so-called gigafactory, with several ""international investors"" making approaches in the past few days.
""While the weakening economic situation is negatively impacting much business investment at present, at Britishvolt we are continuing to pursue positive ongoing discussions with potential investors,"" the company added.
roject had been heralded by ministers as an example of ""levelling up"" - a Conservative aim of investing in communities to reduce economic imbalances in the country - with Blyth being one of Labour's seats to turn blue in the 2019 General Election.
At the time, then Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the investment as a ""levelling up opportunity"", while then Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the factory and the jobs it was forecast to create was ""exactly what levelling up looks like"".
£100m government pledge to Britishvolt is aimed at helping to build its battery plant, as well as attracting more private investment for the development.
However, Britishvolt has been forced to delay the start of production at the plant several times, with the latest company announcement stating it would be delayed again until the middle of 2025."	/news/business-63483666
business	Energy bills: More help may be expected next year, says think tank	"government is likely to come under pressure to help households with soaring energy bills again next year, the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank has warned.
IFS said calls for help were likely to continue for ""at least"" another year if oil and gas prices do not fall.
Energy bills are expected to keep rising until at least spring 2023.
But the government insisted the support package announced by the chancellor on Thursday was a ""temporary"" measure.
£15bn package means every UK household will get an energy bill discount of £400 from October, with further support for the poorest households, pensioners and disabled people.
w measures add to around £17bn of support already given by the government. This included one-off £150 council tax rebates for most homes in England and Wales and matched funding for the other devolved nations.
A steep rise in the cost of living, in particular a jump in energy prices in April, and a second one scheduled for October, had put growing pressure on the government to take action.
uncement, which came a day after the publication of Sue Gray's report into rule-breaking at Downing Street during the pandemic, was on a larger scale than many expected.
upport was broadly welcomed and described as a ""genuinely big package"" by the IFS. 
However, the think tank warned that it could prompt calls for additional support again next year, which in turn could contribute to further inflation.
""I think the biggest risk is that the chancellor will be tempted to do this again and again, and I think if that happens then we really could be in for a bit of trouble,"" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme.
""He's got the most extraordinarily difficult decisions to make later this year on public sector pay, and then he'll be under pressure I suspect again this time next year when energy prices will still be high. 
""I think if he's tempted to continue putting money in to an economy where inflation is very high then that becomes a significant risk.""
Adam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said the chancellor's measures averted ""the darkest of outcomes"" but warned ""millions will still be struggling and the energy crisis is far from over"".
He said a ""large, more targeted intervention is what was needed ahead of winter"", and said the government needed to plan for energy prices to remain high for some time. 
f living is set to continue to rise, with inflation - the rate at which prices go up - at a 40-year high and forecast to hit 10% later this year. 
Concerns have also been raised that the extra support for households could contribute to further inflation, by providing more spending power in the economy at a time when supply chains and the labour market are struggling to meet demand.
However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak insisted that his new measures would have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation.
Higher energy prices, caused in part by the war in Ukraine, have been a key factor driving inflation and analysts expect energy costs to remain high.
Cornwall Insight, has predicted the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, will be marginally higher in spring 2023 to around £2,818 than the price cap this autumn at £2,791. 
f the extra support for energy bills will be partly offset by a 25% additional tax on oil and gas firms' profits, which have soared in recent months.
Opposition parties had been calling for a windfall tax on energy firms for several months. 
A windfall tax is a one-off levy imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall.
Mr Sunak said the ""energy profits levy"" had been designed so it would ""incentivise and encourage investment"".
But Dan Atzori, research partner at Cornwall Insight, warned the tax came with ""risks to both investment and energy security"".
If windfall taxes were repeated over time, Mr Atzori said, it risked ""creating an unstable environment, and may lead to energy producers, who operate globally, investing and relocating to other areas"".
government had previously rejected the idea of a windfall tax on energy firms' profit, but Mr Sunak said with the sector ""making extraordinary profits"" he was ""sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly"".
However, energy giant BP said while it knew ""how difficult things are for people"" Thursday's announcement was ""not for a one-off tax"" but a ""multi-year proposal"".
""Naturally we will now need to look at the impact of both the new levy and the tax relief on our North Sea investment plans,"" it said.
which represents oil and gas firms, Offshore Energies UK, said the levy would ""drive away"" investors and cut UK energy production."	/news/business-61600185
business	UK economy grows but fears remain over rising prices	"UK economy rebounded in May after shrinking in April and March, official figures show.
my grew by 0.5% during the month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, higher than the flat growth most economists expected.
Every area of the economy expanded including construction, travel and manufacturing.
However, businesses reported that higher running costs had led to them to put up prices for customers.
And with household disposable incomes set to fall further in the autumn when energy prices are set to rise again, there is ""still a real risk"" that the economy could fall into a recession, said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
""That may mean the economy proves to be a poisoned chalice for whoever wins the race to be the next prime minister,"" he added.
Conservative MPs will cast their first votes in the leadership contest on Wednesday, but whoever replaces Boris Johnson is faced with the dilemma of how to tackle the soaring cost of living.
Both businesses and households are being hit by rising prices, which are surging at their fastest rate for 40 years due to record-high fuel and energy costs.
UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9.1% in May, and is expected to reach 11% later this year.
Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has vowed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%, ""no ifs or buts"". It has raised rates five times since December and is expected to put them up again next month.  He has indicted the Bank will ""act forcefully"" suggesting it could raise rates by more than 0.25%.
rise in the cost of living has led to unions calling for pay rises to help workers cope. Several industries, such as the railways, have seen workers strike over pay.
But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers via higher prices.
Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said the UK economy had ""rebounded"" in May - with growth across the main sectors, including construction which saw a rise in housebuilding and office refurbishments.
""Health was the biggest driver with many more people seeing GPs, despite test and trace and the vaccination programmes winding down,"" he added.
GDP, or gross domestic product, measures the activity of companies, the state and individuals in an economy.
Part of how GDP is calculated includes measuring the total value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, construction - but also health services and the government, In the health sector, we don't pay for services through the NHS, so one gauge of how it is faring is the number of GP appointments which gives an indication of how that bit of the economy is doing.
Mr Morgan added that road haulage also had a ""busy"" May, while travel agencies saw a jump in demand as people booked summer holidays.
However, while the economy grew, many businesses reported that an increase in fuel and electricity costs had forced them to put up their prices for customers.
UK's statistics body also cited price increases for metals, some foods, including fish, and other staples.
Pub chain JD Wetherspoon warned on Wednesday that its annual losses will be bigger than expected after ramping up wages to attract staff and spending heavily on repairs and marketing.
Although sales were now matching those seen in 2019, before the pandemic struck, it said staff costs were far higher than pre-Covid, as firms across the sector had to hike wages to overcome staff shortages.
w chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi - who is in the race to be the next Conservative Party leader and prime minister - said it was ""great"" to see the economy growing, but added that he knew people were concerned by rising prices.
""We're working alongside the Bank of England to bear down on inflation and I am confident we can create a stronger economy for everyone across the UK,"" Mr Zahawi said.
But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said economic growth was ""still far too slow"".
""Instead of presenting the plans we need for a stronger, more secure economy, the Tories are spending every waking minute indulging in unfunded fantasy economics,"" she added.
British economy returned to solid growth in May, up by 0.5%, defying fears of a month of stagnation. The services sector drove half the growth, in particular health services, including GP appointments. Monthly figures are volatile, but thanks to some upward earlier revisions, growth over the three months to May was 0.4%.
However, consumers showed signs of being squeezed by the cost of living - with wholesale and retail dragging down the economy in May. 
ONS also said respondents to its surveys reported that they were passing on price increases to consumers including fuel, electricity, nickel, cobalt, aluminium, steel, paper, fish and cooking oil.
figures raise some hope of the economy avoiding a feared recession. But many expect the economy to have fallen back again in June. The figures for the full second quarter are released next month.
In June, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) warned the UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year, and will stagnate next year as consumers rein in their spending and commodity prices remain high.
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the UK will be the slowest growing economy among the world's largest economies in 2023.
David Bharier, head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce, said May's growth was ""welcome news"", but ""masks serious underlying issues of growing imbalances within the economy"".
He said that ""worryingly"" its recent survey showed that longer term business confidence had begun to fall.
""The present political instability will have only exacerbated uncertainty among small firms,"" he said.
""Alongside this, the economy is still facing massive structural issues - including uncertainty about the UK's relationship with the EU, continued Covid lockdowns in China, supply chain breakdowns and rocketing energy costs."""	/news/business-62146064
business	Retail sales jump in April driven by cigarettes and alcohol	"Sales of alcohol and tobacco were the main driver behind a surprise rise in overall UK retail sales in April.
Despite the rising cost of living hitting household budgets, sales volumes jumped 1.4% last month, following a fall of 1.2% in March.
However, official figures revealed a longer downward trend of sales overall. 
Office for National Statistics said off-licences saw a boost in sales last month, which it suggested meant people were staying in to save money. 
Danni Hewson, a financial analyst for AJ Bell, said the ""big uptick"" in food and drink spending in supermarkets ""might indicate that people are choosing their kitchen tables over pubs and restaurants as they look to save money"".
""Whilst food spend has been largely unchanged, which suggests people are still being cautious, spend on alcohol and tobacco has soared,"" she added.
""Life's little luxuries... will have to come in under budget as those budgets are tested.""
Experts had expected sales in April to fall further as consumers cut back in the face of rising living costs. 
Earlier this week, the latest official figures showed inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9% in the 12 months to April - the highest rate for 40 years.
April saw the first impact of the latest jump in energy costs, with millions of people facing an unprecedented £700-a-year increase in bills.
However, prices have been rising for months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and the Ukraine war, while wages have been failing to keep pace. The rate of inflation is expected to continue to rise this year.
ONS has previously said that people had begun to cut back on spending and use their cars less due to record petrol and diesel prices.
Over the three months to the end of April, sales overall edged down by 0.3%, which revealed a longer downward trend, the ONS said.
However, while sales volumes at non-food stores were down in April, online sales rose by 3.7% and the proportion of retail sales online remained substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels, said Heather Bovill of the ONS.
""Clothing sales had a strong month especially online, with some retailers suggesting consumers were purchasing clothes for summer holidays and weddings,"" she said.
AJ Bell's Ms Hewson said summer would be the time for ""postponed events and much anticipated holidays"".
""After a couple of years where only the top half was visible to most of the world people are updating their wardrobes,"" she added.
But she warned the boost might be short-lived, saying: ""People can only spend a pound once and when that pound is worth significantly less than a year ago people have to make choices.""
Surveys also suggest consumer confidence has taken a hit. The long-running GfK consumer confidence index fell by two points in May to -40, the lowest score since the survey began in 1974.
GfK's Joe Staton said May's result was one point lower than the previous record set in July 2008.
""This means consumer confidence is now weaker than in the darkest days of the global banking crisis, the impact of Brexit on the economy, or the Covid shutdown,"" he said.
However, Nicholas Farr, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said April's rise in retail sales suggested the higher cost of living had not caused consumer spending to collapse and meant ""the economy may have a little more momentum than we thought"".
He added that rising inflation could not be solved without the Bank of England having to increase interest rates further.
Bank's response to rising prices has been to raise interest rates to try and cool them. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend which dampens demand.
However, it has has faced criticism from MPs for not doing enough to tackle the crisis. This week Bank governor Andrew Bailey defended its response, insisting inflation was being driven by global forces that limited what the Bank could do."	/news/business-61519378
business	UK minister warns of risk over high Scottish taxes	"Scotland could risk losing highly paid jobs if its tax rates are higher than other parts of the country, a senior UK government minister has warned. 
Nadhim Zahawi said the Scottish government should be encouraging businesses to invest in the country. 
And he said no one should want to see a ""flight of talent"" from Scotland because of higher taxes.  
UK government announced last week that it would be cutting income tax rates for higher earners.
ges do not apply in Scotland, where income tax rates and bands are decided by the Scottish government.
It has not yet said what it will do when it sets out its own budget plans later in the year. 
But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has described the tax cuts elsewhere in the UK as ""morally abhorrent"" and said it would be a ""serious error"" to do the same in Scotland.
re have been suggestions that taxing high earners more in Scotland could potentially lead to the country raising less money than it would otherwise do. 
use it may become harder to attract highly-paid people to move to Scotland, and because it could lead to ""tax flight"" - where the highest earners either physically move out of Scotland or find ways of being taxed under the English system rather than the Scottish one. 
Mr Zahawi, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told BBC Scotland that he believed the Scottish government should focus on maximising how much it raises in tax rather than on the rates of tax that people pay. 
He stressed that it was a decision for the Scottish government to take, but said nobody wanted to see a ""flight of talent"" from Scotland and that the government should be encouraging businesses to invest in the country. 
He added: ""There are 2.3 million people who work across the United Kingdom in financial services and it's not all about London and the City of London - that only has about 175,000 people. 
""If those people come to Scotland because they are able to work in the financial services sector their bonuses are taxed at 50%.
""That means we could spend on police officers and nurses and doctors and teachers for the education system and dealing with the scourge of the drugs epidemic in Scotland.
""That happens by investing and investment can only happen if you grow the economy, which is why we need the growth plan.""
Mr Zahawi briefly served as Chancellor of the Exchequer before being replaced by Kwasi Kwarteng when Liz Truss became prime minister earlier this month. 
Mr Kwarteng announced in last week's mini-budget that the basic rate of income tax will be cut from 20% to 19% from April of next year.
He also pledged to abolish the 45% additional rate of tax, which is paid by people who earn more than £150,000 a year - a tax saving of nearly £3,000 a year for somebody with an annual income of £200,000.
It means the 40% higher rate, for earnings of over £50,270, will be the top rate elsewhere in the UK.
But in Scotland everyone earning between £43,663 and £150,000 currently pays 41%, with those earning more than £150,000 paying 46%.
Changes to stamp duty in England also mean that people buying properties worth up to £250,000 will no longer need to pay stamp duty.
House buyers in Scotland currently have to pay the Scottish equivalent of stamp duty - Land and Buildings Transactions Tax - on properties worth over £140,000.
However, Scottish businesses will benefit from the scrapping of a planned rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25%.
And a 1.25% rise in National Insurance will also be reversed across the UK from 6 November - which the UK government said would save 2.3 million Scottish workers an average of £285 a year.
UK government has also said it will work with the Scottish government to set up Investment Zones in Scotland, which will offer tax cuts for businesses and more relaxed planning rules to release more land for housing and commercial development.
r has said he wants to kickstart a ""new era"" for the UK economy that would be focused on growth, and that there are more tax cuts to come. 
Speaking on Monday, Ms Sturgeon predicted that the strategy would not work, and would instead do ""deep and very serious"" damage to the economy and living standards.

""We live in a situation right now where growing numbers can't afford to heat their homes, can't afford to feed their children, are going without basic essentials.

business	Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng hails 'new era' as he unveils tax cuts	"Watch: Stamp duty to income tax - What to know about Kwarteng's 'new era'
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has unveiled the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years, as he hailed a ""new era"" for the UK economy. 
Income tax and the stamp duty on home purchases will be cut and planned rises in business taxes have been scrapped.
Mr Kwarteng said a major change of direction was needed to kick start economic growth.
But Labour said it would not solve the cost-of-living crisis and was a ""plan to reward the already wealthy"".
It comes as the Bank of England warns the UK may already be in recession.
und sank to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar as the chancellor gave his statement. 
In a departure from Boris Johnson's economic policies, Mr Kwarteng has scrapped plans to push up taxes to pay for public services, with the aim of boosting economic growth.
In a Commons statement, being dubbed a mini-budget, he said high tax rates ""damage Britain's competitiveness"", reducing the incentive to work and for businesses to invest. 
He announced that the basic rate of income tax would be reduced by one percentage point to 19% in April - one year earlier than planned. 
He also unveiled a cut to the top rate of income tax from 45% to 40%, meaning the UK will have a single higher rate from April. 
Other measures include:
Mr Kwarteng fulfilled promises to reverse the rise in National Insurance payments introduced by Mr Johnson to pay for social care and tackle the NHS backlog.
He confirmed a planned corporation tax increase from 19% to 25% would also be scrapped.
f the permanent tax cuts announced by the chancellor are estimated at almost £45bn by 2027, which the chancellor said would ""turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth"". 
""We need a new approach for a new era, focused on growth,"" he added. 
Government borrowing will increase by £72bn as a result of the announcements, according to the Treasury. 
ges to income tax do not apply in Scotland but cuts to corporation tax and national insurance are UK-wide.
Paul Johnson, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the statement amounted to the biggest tax cuts since the 1972 Budget, with the cuts 50% bigger than had been expected. 
He said that the UK could be borrowing £120bn in three years' time to afford the measures.
Mr Johnson added that the plans were a ""big gamble"", with money being pumped into the economy when inflation remains high. However, he said they were ""manageable"" if economic growth ""really picks up"". 
mini-budget. This is a radical tax-cutting economic intervention, which is a significant change of course. 
Boris Johnson's tax plans have been junked. Many households will save some money, but some of the biggest tax cuts will be for those with the biggest salaries. 
And this will cost a lot of money.
r's calculation is that it's worth it. People need help with bills and slashing tax will stimulate growth. If you grow the economy, there will be more tax raised and that will help pay the debt in the medium term.
But many are sceptical it will work. 
Senior Conservatives have been warning for months that the strategy is wrong and will saddle future generations with debt. 
Opposition parties believe the government has the wrong priorities with tax cuts for the wealthy and should be raising more money from a windfall tax on energy company profits.
reasury hasn't said when it expects to achieve its desired economic growth.
But the chancellor is determined to press ahead with a radical change of direction. The big question now: will it work?
Labour described his statement as ""an admission of 12 years of economic failure"". 
""The Conservatives cannot solve the cost-of-living crisis, the Conservatives are the cost-of-living crisis, and our country cannot afford them anymore,"" shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said. 
""The chancellor has made clear who his priorities are today. Not a plan for growth. A plan to reward the already wealthy. A return to the trickle-down of the past. Back to the future, not a brave new era.""
Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""This was the billionaire's budget, showing the Conservatives are completely out of touch with families struggling to pay the bills.""
Watch: Labour says Tories created 'vicious circle of stagnation'
ment also included details of the cost of the government's plan to cap energy bills for households and businesses.
Mr Kwarteng said these estimated costs were ""particularly uncertain, given volatile energy prices"" but based on recent prices the total cost of the package for the six months from October was expected to be around £60bn. 
""We expect the cost to come down as we negotiate new, long-term energy contracts with suppliers,"" he added. 
government normally releases an independent forecast of how major tax changes will impact the economy, but Mr Kwarteng has opted not to do this, as his statement is not technically a Budget.
However, Mr Kwarteng promised the Office for Budget Responsibility would publish a full economic forecast before the end of the year, with a second to follow in the new year. 
uge increase in borrowing comes at a time when inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 40-year high, leading to higher interest payments. 
On Thursday the Bank of England raised interest rates from 1.75% to 2.25% - the highest level for 14 years - in an attempt to cool soaring prices.

business	New shared banking hubs to open in 13 more places	"Another 13 locations have been earmarked for shared banking hubs in areas where the last branch has closed.
A swathe of branch closures have raised concerns about access to cash for those who need it, and difficulties for small businesses trying to deposit takings.
r areas were previously identified, but the doors have yet to open on any of their new hubs.
Ministers have prepared legislation to ensure people can access cash locally, while experts say hubs are not enough.
""Cash is disappearing at a frightening rate, and so are ATMs and branches and it is not acceptable to leave communities without access to cash,"" John Howells, chief executive of Link - which is the biggest interbank network in the UK - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""There is real investment and effort going in by the banks now…But now that pace needs to be picked up,"" he added.
At these hubs, customers of any bank can access their accounts, deposit cash and cheques, and withdraw money at any time. Trickier enquiries are dealt with by a representative from one of each of the major banks who each visit once a week.
Among the 13 new proposed banking hub sites, four are in Scotland and, for the first time, one is in Northern Ireland, in Kilkeel.
will be in Brechin in Angus, Forres in Moray, Carluke in Lanarkshire, Kirkcudbright in Dumfries and Galloway, Axminster in Devon, Barton-upon-Humber in Lincolnshire, Lutterworth in Leicestershire, Royal Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire, Cheadle in Staffordshire, Belper in Derbyshire, Maryport in Cumbria, Hornsea in Yorkshire, and also in Kilkeel.
BBC visited a prototype shared banking hub in Rochford, Essex, and was told it had been ""a lifeline"" for many people living in the area after the last branch in town closed.
Running costs are the same as a small branch, but are shared between different banking groups that use it.
Natalie Ceeney, who chairs the Cash Action Group which is overseeing the project, said: ""Cash still matters hugely to millions of people across the UK and with the cost-of-living crisis biting, more and more people are turning to cash as a way of budgeting effectively. Banking Hubs are an important part of the solution.""
Each time a core banking service such as a cash machine or bank branch is closed, an assessment is carried out by Link - the organisation which currently oversees the UK's ATM network.

fied as part of that work.
However, it can take months for these new hubs to open. As well as finding a suitable premise, often changes are needed to ensure it is fully accessible and secure enough for banking services.
re has been some criticism that services have not yet started in any of the previously-announced locations for banking hubs, apart from the two trial premises in Rochford and Cambuslang, in Scotland.
Ron Delnevo, a business consultant with years of experience in the ATM industry, said that ""the promised hubs don't even scratch the surface in terms of satisfying the banking needs of the UK"".
Mark Aldred, of banking technology company Auriga, said: ""As we go into a cost of living crisis that's hitting households and businesses alike, these shared hubs are good on paper but could go further and faster.""
A Financial Conduct Authority spokesperson said: ""Firms need to pick up the pace and deliver more banking hubs. We expect this to be done as a priority.
""Banks and building societies must treat their customers fairly and provide alternatives to branches where needed. Banking hubs are one of a range of tools they can use to ensure communities have easy access to bank services and cash.""
In addition to the hubs, withdrawal and deposit machines - which are unstaffed but can allow businesses to cash in their takings - will be placed in libraries and community centres and available during their opening hours.

business	Rail strikes: No train services on some lines on Saturday	"rain companies affected by Saturday's train driver strike have scaled down their timetables with some operators running no services at all.
Nine train companies will be affected when 6,500 members from train drivers union Aslef walk in a row over pay.
Passengers have faced disruption over the summer due to several rail strikes, with unions wanting pay increases in line with the rising cost of living.
But rail bosses have accused unions of a ""total disregard"" for passengers.
rain operators including Southeastern, CrossCountry, London Northwestern Railway and West Midlands Railway will run no services on Saturday.
Elsewhere, Great Western Railway has said ""an extremely limited service"" will operate, but only between Bristol Temple Meads and London Paddington, Reading and Oxford, and Reading and Basingstoke. 
Avanti West Coast has told passengers most of its network will have no services, and is advising them not to travel. Hull Trains will only run one service too and from London King's Cross.
Meanwhile, LNER said it will only run an extremely limited timetable and its trains will be very busy. There will be only one return train from Leeds to London train all day, and one train every two hours in both directions between Edinburgh and London.
Greater Anglia has also told passengers to avoid travelling on the Stansted Express on Saturday because it will be heavily reduced service, with no direct trains on that route. There will also be no direct Stansted Express trains on Sunday.
London Underground is also expected to be affected. Transport for London has also advised passengers there will be no service on the entire London Overground network, which is operated by Arriva Rail London, whose drivers are part of the strike.
Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, has said passengers with tickets on the strike day can use their ticket either on the day before, or up to and including Tuesday 16 August.
group has previously said Aslef's strike announcement showed a ""cynical approach to talks, a total disregard for passengers and is putting everyone's summer plans at risk"".
""This action will bring the total number of strike days on the railway to ten, disrupting plans in June, July and August,"" a statement said.
Different unions representing different jobs across the rail industry have held strike action and are planning to stage more in the coming weeks due to one main reason - pay.
In 2021, the median salary for train and tram drivers was £59,189 per year, while other rail workers such as ticket collectors and guards get £33,310. Rail construction and maintenance workers which lay and repair tracks receive £34,998 on average.
rain drivers union Aslef says it wants a pay rise for its members that reflects the increased cost of living. Train companies say they want to give a pay rise, but reforms are required to fund it. No deal has been agreed.
RMT union, which represents guards and signalling staff, has held talks with Network Rail, which owns the UK's railway infrastructure, but again a pay deal is yet to be agreed, with the wage rises offered below the current rate of inflation.
RMT also disagrees with plans by Network Rail to cut jobs, as the company tries to save £2bn over the next two years.
government has said the railway system needs modernisation and has to be financially sustainable for the long term. It says £16bn of taxpayers' money was used to support the railways during the Covid pandemic. However, with passenger numbers still down by one-fifth, it says changes are needed."	/news/business-62477762
business	Gatwick flights cancelled at short notice due to staff sickness	"Around 26 EasyJet flights in and out of Gatwick have been cancelled at short notice, with the airport blaming staff sickness.
A spokesperson said the London airport was facing staff shortages in its air traffic control tower.
It came as Gatwick reported its half-year results, which said it was ""now very much operating business as usual"".
usands of people have been hit by flight cancellations and airport delays this summer. 
ustry has struggled with staff shortages as demand for air travel has rebounded after the pandemic.
Around a third of people have experienced disruption while travelling abroad over the past eight weeks, according to the Office for National Statistics.
Out of those, four in five said their flights had been delayed or that they had faced longer waiting times on planes, while one in four reported flight cancellations.
Gatwick confirmed that 13 arrivals and 13 departures had been cancelled, out of a total of 180 EasyJet flights scheduled for Tuesday. 
A spokesperson said: ""At 7am, restrictions were put on the number of flights that can arrive into Gatwick due to late-notice staff absence in the airport's control tower.
""Some flights throughout the day may unfortunately be delayed or cancelled as a result. Gatwick would like to apologise for any inconvenience this will cause to our passengers.""
Staff at Gatwick's air traffic control tower are employed by a company called Air Navigation Solutions (ANS), rather than by Gatwick Airport itself. 
A spokesperson for ANS said the firm regretted any inconvenience caused, adding it was ""working closely"" with the airport and airlines to minimise disruption.
""Despite thorough planning and pre-emptive contingency measures in place to address any potential issues, our capacity is currently being slightly affected by a series of isolated cases of short-notice sickness amongst our team of skilled air traffic controllers at London Gatwick,"" the spokesperson said.
""This, coupled with delays in Europe, has resulted in a small reduction in operations today.""
Earlier in the summer, Gatwick recruited 400 extra security staff to try to ease queues over the holidays.
It also introduced a daily flight cap, which it said would help passengers ""experience a more reliable and better standard of service"".
In its latest results statement, the airport - which is London's second busiest - said it does not expect to extend the cap beyond the end of August.
It contrasts with Heathrow, which said last week that it will extend a cap on the number of passengers flying from the airport until the end of October due to staff shortages.
Stuart Hayles and his friend Stephen, from Oxford, woke up to a text message telling them their EasyJet flight from Mallorca to Gatwick had been cancelled.
""We were due to fly this morning, now we're stranded here, with no explanation,"" Mr Hayles said.

business	Energy bill help to be reduced from April, says Jeremy Hunt	"A scheme to cap all household energy bills for two years will be cut from April, the new chancellor has said. 
Jeremy Hunt said the support - which limits a typical household bill to £2,500 - would be reviewed so it cost ""significantly less than planned"". 
He said the most vulnerable would continue to be protected from soaring wholesale energy prices.
move sparked concern among consumer groups who warned households would be plunged into uncertainty. 
""Everyone knows why decisions have been made at breakneck speed, but there are questions that need to be answered, and answered quickly,"" said National Energy Action boss Adam Scorer.
""Who will still get support? Will it include vulnerable households not on welfare benefits? Will that support be deeper for those in greatest need?""
Mr Hunt is trying to save money after the government's mini-budget left a big projected hole in the public finances. Its plan for large tax cuts sparked turmoil on financial markets over how the plans would be funded.
""Beyond [April], the Prime Minister and I have agreed it would not be responsible to continue exposing public finances to unlimited volatility in international gas prices,"" the chancellor said. 
""The objective is to design a new approach that will cost the taxpayer significantly less than planned whilst ensuring enough support for those in need,"" he said.
Under the Energy Price Guarantee, announced last month, Ms Truss's government capped all household energy bills for two years from 1 October in a bid to prevent millions facing hardship this winter.
Now that will only be in place for six months, just to cover this winter. The Treasury will review support given from April, but Mr Hunt said there would be ""a new approach"" targeting those in the most need.
Before this guarantee was introduced, the energy price cap - the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge households for every unit of energy they use - had been due to rise to £3,549 for a typical household from October.
Predictions from consultants Cornwall Insight suggest that, for households that do not receive any support, a typical annual energy bill could be £4,347 in the spring, dropping to £3,722 next winter - however that prediction could be significantly affected by changing wholesale prices.
How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch.
Consumer rights campaigner Martin Lewis said that while the support for intervention had been desperately needed, a ""universal energy price guarantee was always expensive and poorly targeted"". 
But he added: ""The post-April support will still need to reach a decent way up the net and support middle earners, energy rates are still huge.""
Ms Truss's plan - thought to cost up to £150bn - was to be funded through government borrowing after the prime minister rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. 
However, former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng followed it with plans to cut taxes by some £45bn.
Concerns about rising borrowing sparked turmoil on financial markets which spilled over into the mortgage market, where interest rates on loans have surged to 14-year highs. 
On Monday, Mr Hunt promised to review the energy support while also reversing £32bn worth of the planned tax cuts. The new chancellor said he was doing ""what is necessary for economic stability"".
He added that the Energy Price Guarantee had been ""the biggest single expense"" of Mr Kwarteng's growth plan. 
When it was announced, many had criticised the scheme for not being targeted enough, arguing the support should have been means tested. 
Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which had described the package as ""clearly not sustainable in the long-term"", welcomed Mr Hunt's decision.
""While large-scale untargeted support for households this winter was perhaps unavoidable we need to do everything possible to put in place a better designed, better targeted and less expensive scheme next year,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson.
But the Centre for Ageing Better, a charity, said many older people faced an anxious wait to find out how much help they would get. 
Boss Carole Easton said: ""The previous two-year promise provided a level of security for people in uncertain times.  
""It is vital that the government gives plenty of advance notice with clear messaging as to who will be eligible for targeted support in April.""
Under Ms Truss's scheme, businesses are protected for six months from soaring energy prices, with those struggling most set to continue receiving help pending a review. 
Mr Hunt suggested the targeted approach would continue, but the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) called for clarity. 
""The review to come on business and consumer energy support after six months must avoid a cliff-edge for small firms that remain impacted and vulnerable,"" said the FSB's national chair, Martin McTague. "	/news/business-63283436
business	Stoke Bruerne: 'Sunny days are perfect for us'	"As temperatures soar on the hottest day of the year so far, how has it been for hospitality businesses in the picturesque village of Stoke Bruerne in Northamptonshire?
""Stoke Bruerne is always busy but the sun comes out and the world and his wife come with it,"" says Andrew Woodward.
As the co-owner of the village's Boat Inn, he is expecting a ""very busy evening"".
Boat Inn has been owned and operated by the Woodward family since 1877.
It is believed to be the longest-running family pub that has maintained the same family name throughout, and is therefore claimed to have the longest lineage of licensee in the country.
In its early days, the inn was run in conjunction with the family's other businesses, the local butchery, bakery, smallholding and working narrowboats.
It also runs boat trips, which Mr Woodward says have kept it busy ""all the way through"" the coronavirus pandemic, and they were even able to run a ""Santa special"" in lockdown.
Even though the pub's costs have ""gone up"" with the rising cost of living - Mr Woodward says their electricity bill for the next three years has almost doubled - they are trying to find a balance.
""All of our costs have gone up, we've offloaded some on to the customer but you can't offload everything on to the customer because they won't come out,"" he says.
Meanwhile, Emily Thorpe says the Canal Museum offers the ""best of both worlds"" in the hot weather.
r services manager of the museum, which showcases the lives of the people of Stoke Bruerne, says the sunny days are ""perfect for us"".
""We've got our indoor space for our museum and we've got a cafe but then we've got chances to go outdoors and explore, go for a woodland walk, a nice shaded area.
""So we can cater for both sides of it, we're not restricted by the weather,"" she says.
museum was renovated last year and admission is free, something which Ms Thorpe says they hope will help people in challenging times.
""We want to be here for the community, we've set ourselves up where there's a lot of free activities so we are hoping we will continue to see people come through,"" she says.
While people are keeping themselves cool by stopping for a drink at the pub, or enjoying an ice cream at the museum's cafe, the animals at Rookery Open Farm are taking shade.
Gillian Bament says the hot weather means it is generally quieter at the farm ""because the children we have coming to the farm at the moment are school-age children so they're vulnerable to the heat so mums tend to stay away until temperatures are lower"".
""But generally the animals cope really well with it, they get under the trees, they find cool spots so they tend to cope fairly well,"" she says.
""If we could have slightly less temperature and the sunshine then that would be perfect, absolutely perfect for everybody.
""But it's swings and roundabouts, you have to have rain for the farm too.""

business	Cuba bids for foreign investment to tackle goods shortages	"Cuba says it will allow foreign investors into its wholesale and retail trade for the first time in 60 years.
move is a major shift for the island nation's Communist government, and overturns a 1960s Fidel Castro policy of nationalising retail.
But Cuba is now facing its most severe economic crisis in decades, with rising prices and public discontent.
ms to tackle shortages of basic goods, like food and medicine - but stops short of fully opening trade.
Government officials said that foreign investors would be able to wholly or partially own Cuba-based wholesalers.
But retail will not be open to international investors without scrutiny, as ""a state market has to prevail"" foreign trade minister Betsy Díaz Velázquez said. 
Economy minister Alejandro Gil said the move will allow for the ""expansion and diversification of supply to the population and contribute to the recovery of domestic industry"". 
In 1969, Fidel Castro nationalised Cuba's private wholesale and retail industry. The new foreign investment bill, however, recognises that the country's centralised government cannot resolve its essential goods shortage without investment from overseas.
Under the new policy, businesses that have been based in Cuba for several years will be prioritised. Government officials said they will prioritise deals with businesses selling green energy technologies and equipment that could boost domestic production.
It added that there will be no market competition at first. 
BBC's Central America and Cuba correspondent Will Grant says the move is something hardliner revolutionaries have opposed for years and its success is by no means guaranteed. 
And Cuba's tightly state-controlled environment does not make it an attractive option for many investors, he adds. 
Some stores in the country have had to introduce rationing, to ensure consumers are able to have access to essential items, like cooking oil. 
usands of people have voiced their anger over high prices and shortages of food and medicine in protests across the country. However, unauthorised public gatherings are illegal in Cuba and many were arrested as a result.
ronavirus pandemic, lower subsidies from Venezuela and former US President Donald Trump's tight restrictions and sanctions on the island have all contributed to its economic problems.
In May, the US agreed to ease Trump-era sanctions on Cuba. Under the new measures approved by the Biden administration, restrictions on travel and how much money US residents could send back to their families in Cuba family were relaxed. 
At the time, Cuba's foreign minister welcomed the announcement, saying it marked ""a small step in the right direction""."	/news/world-latin-america-62572149
business	Heathrow hits back at 'bizarre' Ryanair criticism	"f Heathrow Airport has hit back at criticism from Ryanair, saying it is ""bizarre"" to blame airports for not having enough staff.
John Holland-Kaye told the BBC it was up to airlines, not airports, to provide ground handling workers.
On Monday, a Ryanair executive criticised airports for not recruiting enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers.
usands of passengers have faced delays and cancellations recently.
A shortage of staff has contributed to the disruption. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have struggled to recruit workers as demand for travel has returned.
Ground handling staff are responsible for a range of services at airports, including loading and unloading baggage.
row comes as the UK's largest airport reported a £263m pre-tax profit for the first half of the year. However, on an adjusted basis, which strips out the impact of changes in interest rates, Heathrow posted a loss before tax of £321m for the period.
On Monday, Ryanair's chief financial officer said airports had not recruited enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they ""had one job to do to"".
Neil Sorahan said ""various governments"" and airports needed to be held to account for ""not staffing up appropriately"".
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Holland-Kaye labelled those comments as ""bizarre"".
He added: ""Airports don't provide ground handling, that's provided by the airlines themselves. So this is like accusing us of not having enough pilots.""
John Strickland, an air transport consultant, said passengers ""don't care who's to blame, they just want to get away"".
""There's clearly a war of words going on,"" he said. ""I think it's not helpful, as everyone in the industry is exposed to this challenge, from airlines to airports to third parties such as handling agencies.""
Mr Strickland said that the pandemic had led to staff shortages across the industry, and that it was still taking time to build numbers back up.
""It would've helped to have a deeper engagement earlier, between airlines and airports, to avoid these problems,"" he said.

Airports blaming airlines. Airlines blaming airports. But when will travel settle down?
g queues, lost bags and flight cancellations have soured the start of the summer for many travellers and left those still waiting to pack their suitcases feeling nervous about what awaits them.
Heathrow said today that the cap on departing passengers is working, improving punctuality.
It says the cap will be in place until airlines start to increase the number of ground handling staff which, by their estimates, might not be back to pre-pandemic levels for another 12 to 18 months. That means we could see the cap imposed again at busy periods like Christmas. 
Airlines have repeatedly said issues like queues at security are nothing to do with them and that airports need to improve their plans to get back to normal.
But some airlines have struggled to recruit ground handling staff which has a knock-on effect on all the others.
f the cap cropping up again after the summer will fill many airlines with dread. 
Mr Holland-Kaye said the summer getaway had started well, but added that a shortage of airline ground handling staff was a constraint on Heathrow's capacity.
He added punctuality had improved since the airport introduced a daily passenger cap.
Earlier this month, Heathrow announced it was limiting the number of passengers who can depart each day over the peak summer months to 100,000.
Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""We've seen a material improvement in performance since [the cap] came into place.
""Punctuality has improved, baggage performance has improved, and that shows that the difficult decisions we took two weeks ago are having the impact so that passengers can travel with confidence at Heathrow this summer.""
Separately, EasyJet reported a pre-tax loss of £114m for the three months to the end of June, after taking a £133m hit from recent airport disruption.
Luton-based airline blamed ""widespread operational challenges"" and a ""tight labour market"" for flight cancellations.
Speaking to BBC 5 Live, boss Johan Lundgren said: ""There's no airline, there's no ground handler, there's no airport who hasn't felt the pressure and the squeeze.""
But he added that EasyJet's operations have now ""definitely stabilised"", adding: ""We are operating very much in line with 2019 levels of operational performance."""	/news/business-62295867
business	Southend: 'It's been terrible this year for the violence'	"Business owners in a seaside city have said large groups of men travelling from London are ""hell-bent"" on causing trouble. 
Arcade owner Martin Richardson, from Southend-on-Sea, said sometimes up to 3,000 people could arrive in a day.
And Joan Tiney, who owns a hotel, said the violence was the worst she had known it for 40 years.
Insp David Gardiner said Essex Police was ""working hard"" with traders and the council to ""combat the issues"".
Essex Police confirmed there had been nine dispersal orders in the town so far this year, compared to 10 last year.
It was also using a new mobile weapons detector called the OpenGate System to keep knives off the street and said it was the first force in the country to use it. 
m has been specifically designed to detect dense metal objects.
Martin Richardson, the owner of Happidrome Arcade, said traders had been working together to deal with large groups coming to the city from London ""hell-bent on causing trouble"". 
uded Operation Union, a police operation to tackle the problem and additional CCTV cameras.  
""We have the 'town-link' radio system where we share information about the large groups arriving off the trains,"" he said.
""C2C trains have been brilliant and they've given us access to their cameras so we know when large groups of males are coming into the city and we will get an idea if there's likely to be trouble.""
At times between 2,000 and 3,000 people might suddenly arrive on just three or four trains, he added. 
""We're not open for trouble. If you play up, you will get caught,"" he added.
Joan Tiney, owner of the Borough Hotel in Southend, said: ""It's been terrible this year for the violence, as bad as I can remember it for all the [40] years we've been here.
""People seem to be 'off the leash' after the lockdown and living through coronavirus.""
Mrs Tiney said she had spoken to first-time visitors to Southend and they had told her they would not be returning due to the trouble. 
She laid the blame with large groups of young people coming into the city from London.

business	TikTok probes claims of aggressive work culture	"kTok is investigating claims of an aggressive work culture after a senior executive at the firm allegedly said he ""didn't believe"" in maternity leave.
Financial Times (FT) reported that Joshua Ma has now stepped back and been replaced in his role leading the social media firm's UK ecommerce team.
It follows a probe by the newspaper which alleged a staff exodus from TikTok's London offices.
Mr Ma was approached for comment.
According to the FT, the launch of TikTok Shop - the firm's livestream shopping feature - in the UK prompted a number of staff to leave and complaints about an aggressive culture that goes against typical working practices in Britain.
wspaper also carried reports of long working hours, with members of the ecommerce team saying they are expected to regularly work more than 12 hours a day.
with Mr Ma relates to a dinner with staff earlier this year, where he allegedly said that as a ""capitalist"", he ""didn't believe"" companies should offer maternity leave.
mpany said it has a clear maternity leave policy in the UK, which includes 30 weeks of paid leave.
But the alleged remarks are being seen as a sign of a wider culture clash between TikTok's Chinese owners, ByteDance, and a number of its London-based workers.
An email to staff, seen by the FT, said that Mr Ma will now ""step back"" from his role.
A TikTok spokesperson said: ""We are investigating alleged statements and actions to determine whether there has been a breach of company policies.""
On the topic of work-life balance, the spokesperson said that employees ""may at times need to work hours that match customer use patterns.
""We aim to make this the exception rather than the norm, and support our team with flexible working hours, regular no-meeting times, and robust health and wellbeing offerings.""
kesperson added: ""TikTok Shop has only been operating in the UK for a few months, and we're investing rapidly in expanding the resources, structures and process to support a positive employee experience."""	/news/business-61729896
business	Energy bills set to rise again in October, regulator warns	"Householders should expect a further rise in energy bills in England, Wales and Scotland in October, the boss of energy regulator Ofgem has said.
Jonathan Brearley said prices in the wholesale energy market remained ""highly volatile"".
Not being able to afford energy bills was a matter of life and death for some people, he said.
Analysts Cornwall Insight predicted that a typical domestic energy bill will go up by £600 a year in October.
would take the typical household's gas and and electricity bill to £2,595.
In a speech in Glasgow, Mr Brearley said that gas markets were in a febrile state following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""The market remains highly volatile and as a result we do expect further price increases later this year,"" he said.
He said that the effect of higher prices was ""putting huge strain on the customers we serve"".
""I talk to customers on a regular basis, and I know how tough rising energy prices are for many households and businesses,"" he said.
""For some, not being able to afford rising energy bills is literally a matter of life and death.""
He pointed to a case in which a woman who was being treated for a brain tumour had worries about keeping up with energy bills.
""What was shocking was to learn that she feels more comfortable in hospital where she can eat and be warm than at home,"" he said.
A widely-predicted increase in October comes on top of a £700 typical rise in annual domestic gas and electricity bills, which took effect in April when the price cap was last raised. Consumers in Northern Ireland - not covered by the price cap - have already seen significant increases in bills.
Businesses have also faced higher energy costs, which may lead to them charging higher prices.
Mr Brearley reiterated a commitment to updating the price cap, putting suppliers under greater scrutiny and helping move the UK away from a reliance on gas.
Earlier on Monday, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggested an estimated 1.5 million households across the UK will struggle to pay food and energy bills over the next year.
A Treasury spokesperson said the country has had a ""strong economic recovery"" from the pandemic but acknowledged that these were ""anxious times"", and said the government was taking action to support households.

business	Train drivers to go on strike on 30 July	"rain drivers at eight rail companies will strike on Saturday, 30 July in a dispute over pay, union Aslef has said.
A total of 5,500 staff will walk out after talks broke down over pay, with the union seeking wages to keep pace with the rising cost of living.
It comes a day after the RMT union, which represents workers such as guards and signalling staff, said it would strike on Wednesday, 27 July.
ransport Secretary Grant Shapps called the strike action ""destructive"".
Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, which represents train drivers, said its members ""don't want go on strike"" but train companies had offered ""nothing"" and claimed the union had been ""forced into this position by the train companies, driven by the Tory government"".
""We don't want to inconvenience passengers - not least because our friends and families use public transport, too, and we believe in building trust in the railways in Britain - and we don't want to lose money by going on strike,"" he said.
Mr Whelan said the union was open to further talks for a ""fair and sensible offer"".
f action on 30 July coincides with the Commonwealth Games, which are being held in Birmingham. The event runs from 28 July until 8 August. It is also the the opening day of the new season for most English Football League clubs.
It is understood the action could have a knock-on effect on services running on the Sunday.
Mr Shapps said: ""It's incredibly disappointing that, just three days after their ballots closed, Aslef bosses have already opted for destructive strike action, instead of engaging in constructive talks.
""Not only that but, by cynically orchestrating strike dates around the Commonwealth Games, it's clear union bosses are determined to cause as much misery as possible and derail an event the whole country is looking forward to.""
rain drivers at the following companies are set to strike:
Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said strike action will ""cause misery, frustration and anger for millions"".
It claimed the walk out would ""take money out of an industry"" and make it harder to give a pay rise in the future.
""We want to give our people an increase in pay, but asking taxpayers to shoulder even more of the burden when they have already contributed £600 per household during the pandemic, or asking passengers to fund it by paying more for their tickets, isn't fair or sustainable,"" it said.
Aslef has already held strike days on Greater Anglia services and another is scheduled for Saturday 23 July. Drivers at Hull Trains are also due to strike on 16 and 23 July.
But today's announcement marks the first time during its current dispute that the union has co-ordinated action by this number of operators on the same day.
If it does go ahead, it won't bring the entire rail network to a halt.  But it would cause widespread disruption, during the Commonwealth Games.
It's in the diary for only a few days after the RMT has scheduled its next strike day - which, judging by the previous strikes in June, would have a knock-on impact on services the following day as well.
Unless settlements can be reached to prevent the strikes going ahead, a summer of disruption on the railway is shaping up.
f living is rising at the fastest rate for 40 years, with inflation at 9.1% and forecast to hit 11% before the end of the year.
rease has led to many unions calling for pay rises to help workers cope. Several industries, including the railways, airports and the Royal Mail, have voted to go strike.
RMT workers walked out for three days in June in a row over pay and jobs, disrupting rail services across the country.
But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers via higher prices.
Aslef's Mr Whelan said wage rises were not ""exacerbating inflation"", saying ""excess profiteering is"".
""The government isn't asking companies to cut profits or dividend payments to help manage inflation. Wages are chasing prices, not putting them up,"" he said.
However, the Night Time Industries Association industry group said strikes ""have already had a devastating impact on the late night economy and hospitality industries are still rebuilding from the fall out of the pandemic"".
Fresh strikes will put further pressure on businesses, it said."	/news/business-62166276

Guernsey-based Aberdeen Retail 1 Ltd and Aberdeen Retail 2 Ltd are said to have suffered ""unsustainable"" cash flow problems due to the Covid pandemic, rising costs and ""intense"" competition.
A buyer is now being sought.
Administrators Azets said the city centre shopping venue would continue to operate as normal in the meantime until any sale.
Bon Accord centre was built in 1990 and merged with the adjacent St Nicholas centre in 2020.
It has branches of major stores including Next, Boots and Waterstones.
Azets restructuring partner James Fennessey said the sale offered a ""very strong brand name and awareness"".
""We are keen to try and find a buyer promptly,"" he said.
At Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, policy director Ryan Crighton described it as ""clearly a concerning development"".
""However, there is precedent with other centres in the UK trading through administration for extended periods, which offers hope,"" he said.
""The Bon Accord Centre has been at the heart of Aberdeen's retail offering for over 30 years - and that must continue. However, if people want a vibrant city centre, this should serve as a clear 'use it or lose it' warning.""
Andrew Turnbull is a senior lecturer in retail marketing at the Robert Gordon University (RGU) Aberdeen Business School.
Mr Turnbull said: ""Aberdeen has to cope with people leaving the city to go to elsewhere, to have weekends away to have big shops away, whether it's Edinburgh or Glasgow, or even further afield.
""Individuals are not coming into the city since the start of working from home and hybrid working. People are doing their shopping locally rather than spending money getting in the car, cost of fuel is also an influence, and they are shopping in the suburbs, in the commuter areas.

business	Philippines lottery: Questions raised as hundreds win jackpot	"A lottery in the Philippines that saw 433 people hit the jackpot has drawn surprise and triggered scrutiny.
It was the highest number of people to have ever won the Grand Lotto's top prize, according to local media.
winning combination for last weekend's 236m peso ($4m; £3.5m) jackpot was a series of numbers which were all multiples of nine.
Philippines senate minority leader Koko Pimentel has called for an inquiry into the ""suspicious"" results.
Participants in the Grand Lotto select six numbers from one to 55. To win the jackpot, all six of a player's numbers have to match those drawn by the lottery's operator.
""These lotto games are authorised by the Republic of the Philippines. Therefore, we need to maintain and protect the integrity of these gambling games,"" Mr Pimentel said as he called for an investigation into the lottery's unusual outcome.
On Sunday, Melquiades Robles, general manager of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), sought to reassure the public and said the drawing of winning numbers cannot be rigged.
PCSO also highlighted that people in the Philippines tended to bet on number sequences.
""Many have held on to their numbers. It's not only good to be loyal to your wives and husbands, it's also good to be loyal to your numbers,"" Mr Robles told a news conference.
PCSO also shared photographs and videos of people collecting their prize money at its office in Mandaluyong city, close to the capital Manila.
""I've been betting on pattern nine, pattern eight, pattern seven and pattern six for many years and I'm thankful I just won,"" one winner said.
rence Tao, a maths professor from University of California, Los Angeles told the BBC that a pattern like this being a winning series of numbers is rare ""for any single lottery"".
""But there are hundreds of lotteries every day around the world, and statistically it would not be surprising that every few decades, one of these lotteries would exhibit an unusual pattern,"" he said.
""It's similar to how in any given hand of poker it would be unlikely to draw a straight flush, but if one looks at hundreds of thousands of hands at once then it actually becomes quite likely that a straight flush would be drawn,"" he added.
It's not the first time a lottery has seen an unusual pattern or sequence of numbers drawn.
re were accusations of fraud after 20 people shared the jackpot in South Africa's national lottery in December 2020, when the numbers five, six, seven, eight, nine and 10 were drawn.
rganisers said the winners collected 5.7m rand ($370,000; £278,000) each.
Meanwhile, a Spanish TV reporter resigned live on air after she thought she'd hit the jackpot in the country's €4m ($3.9m; £3.4m) Christmas lottery.
Natalia Escudero started screaming on camera and told colleagues at public broadcaster RTVE she was ""not coming to work tomorrow"" - before later learning she had won just €5,000 ($4,349; £3,784).
And spare a thought for those whose lucky numbers came up in a lotto draw in the UK in March 2016.
More than 4,000 correctly picked five out of the six numbers - all multiples of seven - and ended up collecting just £15 each for their win.

business	Crown Resorts: Casino firm fined over illegal China dealings	"Australian gaming operator Crown Resorts has been fined A$80m ($57.4m; £45.6m) for illegally accepting Chinese bank cards at its casino in Melbourne.
Regulators say the transactions were falsely classified as hotel services.
r money laundering and excessive gambling casinos in Australia are not allowed to accept bank cards.
Crown acknowledged its ""historic failings"" and says its top executives were in the process of reforming how the company operates.
On Monday, the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) said Crown had breached Australia's casino regulations by allowing gambling funds to be withdrawn using credit or debit cards.
regulator found that Crown had processed A$164m Australian dollars in China UnionPay card payments, drawing in A$32m of revenue in the process, between 2012 and 2016.
It said the transactions were falsely classified as ""services"" provided by the Crown Towers hotel in Melbourne.
However, patrons were given vouchers that could be exchanged for cash or chips at Crown's neighbouring casino.
According to the regulator, the ""clandestine"" scheme also allowed some Chinese nationals to spend more in foreign currencies than was allowed under Chinese law.
""Crown benefited handsomely from its illegal conduct,"" VGCCC chairwoman Fran Thorn said in a statement.
""The fine will ensure that Crown is stripped of the revenue it derived from the process and will send a clear message that it must comply with its regulatory obligations,"" Ms Thorn added.
In response, the gaming group said its board and senior management were ""committed to the delivery of a comprehensive reform and remediation programme to ensure Crown delivers a safe and responsible gaming environment"".
Crown - which operates integrated resorts in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney - is also under scrutiny from regulators who have alleged the company had knowingly dealt with criminal organisations then misled authorities about those dealings.
Its casino in Melbourne is currently only allowed to operate under the supervision of a government-appointed manager.

business	BT and Openreach staff walk out in strike over pay	"usands of BT and Openreach staff staged fresh strike action on Tuesday as part of an ongoing pay dispute with the telecoms giant. 
Communication Workers Union (CWU) said more than 40,000 of its members are striking today and on Wednesday.
It coincides with further strikes at Royal Mail, where 115,000 CWU members are set to walk out on 31 August.   
Separately, major unions are seeking to co-ordinate strike action this autumn as they step up demands for better pay.
Unite and Unison have have submitted motions ahead of the Trade Union Congress next month which call for future walkouts to be synchronised.
It follows a wave of strike action across the UK which has spanned a range of sectors including rail workers, barristers and rubbish collectors.
CWU said its members are striking against a £1,500 pay rise offered by BT Group. ""The reason for the strike is simple: workers will not accept a massive deterioration in their living standards,"" said CWU general secretary Dave Ward.
BT Group said the offer represented an increase of around 5% on average which rose to 8% for the lowest paid and was the highest pay rise in more than 20 years. 
But Mr Ward said: ""In the context of Retail Price Index inflation levels already hitting 11.7% this year, this is a dramatic real-terms pay cut."" 
""These are the same workers who kept the country connected during the pandemic,"" he said. ""Without CWU members, there would have been no home-working revolution, and vital technical infrastructure may have malfunctioned or been broken when our country most needed it.""
A spokesperson for BT said: ""We know that our colleagues are dealing with the impacts of high inflation and, although we're disappointed, we respect their decision to strike.
""We have made the best pay award we could and we are in constant discussions with the CWU to find a way forward from here."" 
It is the second time that BT workers have gone out on strike this year.
Postal workers at Royal Mail will also be going out on strike again, resuming on Wednesday - while two more days of industrial action will be held on 8-9 September.  
A Royal Mail spokesperson said: ""The CWU's self-centred actions with the wider trade union movement is putting jobs at risk, and making pay rises less affordable... making Royal Mail's future more uncertain than at any time in its long history.""
""The CWU is deflecting to avoid talking about the changes we need to make as a business,"" the spokesperson added.

business	Ukraine war: Russia earns $97bn on energy exports since invasion	"Russia earned nearly $100bn (£82.3bn) from oil and gas exports during the first 100 days of the war in Ukraine, according to a report. 
Revenues have been falling since March, as many countries shunned Russian supplies, but remain high, the independent Centre For Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) found. 
It also warned of potential loopholes in efforts to curb imports from Russia.
EU, US and UK are among those to have pledged to cut Russian imports.
But the CREA report found Russia still earned $97bn in revenue from fossil fuel exports in the first 100 days of the Ukraine conflict, from 24 February to 3 June. 
European Union made up 61% of these imports, worth approximately $59bn.
Overall, exports of Russian oil and gas are falling and Moscow's revenue from energy sales has also declined from a peak of well over $1bn a day in March. 
But revenues still exceeded the cost of the Ukraine war during the first 100 days - with the CREA estimating that Russia is spending around $876m per day on the invasion. 
EU plans to ban Russian oil imports arriving by sea by the end of 2022, which would cut imports by two-thirds.
In March, the bloc also committed to reducing gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year.
However, so far it has been unable to agree on an outright ban. 
Meanwhile, the US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports. The UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year.
CREA report said the EU's planned oil embargo would have a significant impact. 
But it warned large quantities of Russian crude oil were now being shipped to India, which increased its share of Russia's total crude exports from around 1% before the invasion of Ukraine to 18% in May. 
report said a ""significant share"" of this was being refined and sold on - often to customers in the US and Europe - which it described as ""an important loophole to close"".
It added that strong sanctions against tankers transporting Russian crude would significantly limit the scope for this practice. 
report points out that as Russia seeks new markets for oil, much of it is being transported by ship - and the majority of the vessels used are owned by European and US companies. 
As well as India, other countries that increased imports of Russian fuel included France, China, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, the report said. 
On the face of it, this report contains a lot of bad news. Energy sales are still in effect funding the war in Ukraine, with high prices offsetting efforts to reduce demand. 
But that doesn't mean pressure on Moscow won't tell in the end. The report's authors expect a partial EU embargo on Russian oil to cut revenues by some $36bn a year, for example. Exports of gas have already fallen dramatically - and there are plans to reduce Europe's reliance on Russia still further. 
Yet embargoes have to be effective. The report points out that more and more Russian oil is being exported to India for refining. And some of those refined products are finding their way back onto European markets. 
Since refined products are not covered by the EU ban, this is a clear potential loophole. 
And with Russian oil being diverted from pipelines and onto ships as Moscow seeks new markets, there is growing demand for vessels to carry it. But the majority of the oil tankers currently being used are owned by European companies. 
For pressure on Russia to be most effective, issues like these will have to be addressed."	/news/business-61785111
business	Energy price cap: Typical energy bill set to rise by £800 a year in October	"usehold energy bill is set to rise by about £800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns.
Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to £2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices. 
Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"".
He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million.
A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy. 
rgy price cap already rose sharply in April to £1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra £700 per year on average.
Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of £2,800."" 
It means the typical household bill could rise by £800 per year.
Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises.
Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues.
He warned that the price cap could rise beyond £2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies.
""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia.""
Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact.
While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased. 
""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee.
But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices.
We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious.
Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying £700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of £800.
rouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is £3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice.
So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead.
Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people.
Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward £9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance.
""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee.
Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"".
Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"". 
""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said.
Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment.
In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"".
Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts?
""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy.""
Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households.
Recently, Shell reported a record £7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made £5bn, the highest for 10 years.

business	People delay turning heating on as UK inflation soars	"rate at which prices rose in September has returned to a 40-year high as a BBC survey uncovers growing concern about the squeeze on finances.
rice of cereals, milk and cheese all went up along with energy bills and transport costs. 
Some 85% of those asked are now worried about the rising cost of living, up from 69% in a similar poll in January. 
As a result, nine in 10 people are trying to save money by delaying putting the heating on.
rising cost of food, fuel and energy dominate fears about rising costs, the survey of 4,132 shows.
Almost half of people (47%) polled in the Savanta Comres survey for the BBC said that energy bills were the most significant increase in cost seen by their household.
Nearly nine in 10 of those asked were turning lights off to save money in the last week, as well as turning electrical goods off standby.
urvey was conducted earlier this month before Chancellor Jeremy Hunt reversed some tax cuts, said support on energy bills would be limited for some, and warned of further government spending cuts.
But more than half of those polled (56%) expect their financial position to worsen in the next six months. It was 30% in January.
wo-thirds of renters who were asked said it had been difficult to pay for essential costs in the last six months. A similar proportion of everyone surveyed said that government support was insufficient to help people with the rising cost of living.
f living rose by 10.1% in the 12 months to September - the fastest rate in 40 years - driven by sharp price rises in energy and food costs.
Food and energy prices have been going up around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine which has disrupted production and exports, as well as pushing up prices at supermarket tills.
September's inflation figures are usually used to calculate next April's rise in the state pension in the UK and the increase in some benefits. It is unclear if the government still intends to stick to this policy or cut down on spending by increasing payments by a lower level by linking the increase to wages instead.
Over half (52%) of UK adults say it has already been difficult for their household to pay essential household costs in the last six months.
People are changing their spending habits to help them cope, cutting back on clothes spending for themselves and their children, taking fewer day trips as well as travelling less to meet up with family or friends, the BBC survey shows.
People are also putting off big purchases such as buying a new car, sofa or TV or renovating their homes.
Among UK adults worried about the cost of living, two thirds have also said this is having a negative effect on their mental health.
Naomi Naylor from Durham is in her of third year of studying to be a paramedic at the University of Sunderland. She worries about the impact higher petrol costs will have on her finances.
ree-quarters of workers in the North East normally commute to work by car, so rising fuel prices can really hit personal finances.
""I commute in and out every day, it's cheaper not paying for accommodation. Petrol is my biggest outlay, it's costing me more than it used to.""
21-year old says she and most of her friends want to stay around this area, but there's also competition for graduate paramedic jobs, which means some may need to look further afield for work.
uld push up their travel costs even more, adding to her concerns.
In Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's emergency announcement on Monday to cut back government spending, the help to limit energy bills rises for households was cut back from two years to six months.
reasury will review support given from April, but Mr Hunt said there would be ""a new approach"" targeting those in the most need.
A spokesman for the Treasury said the government had reversed the rise in National Insurance and made changes to help people on universal credit.
""Countries around the world are facing rising costs, driven by Putin's illegal war in Ukraine, and we know this is affecting people here in the UK,"" he said.
""That is why we have taken decisive actions to hold down bills this winter through the Energy Price Guarantee and provided at least £1,200 of additional cost-of-living support to eight million of the most vulnerable households.""

He was released after posting a $11,085 (£9,711) bond on Sunday.
urred on Saturday night as he left a parking garage in Fayetteville, Arkansas after a football game, a local TV channel said.
He became involved in a dispute with another driver and bit the man ""ripping the flesh on the tip of the nose,"" according to KNWA/KFTA, a US television station which cited a preliminary police report.
Fayetteville police did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.
Mr Ramsey previously had a three-decade career at meat processing giant Tyson Foods, where he oversaw the company's poultry and McDonald's business units.
He joined Beyond Meat as its chief operating officer in December last year.
""I am proud to join in its mission to produce delicious products that are healthier for our customers and more sustainable for our planet,"" Mr Ramsey said at the time of his appointment.
Mr Ramsey and Beyond Meat did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.
Beyond Meat - which makes plant-based burgers, sausages and nuggets - made its stock market debut on New York's Nasdaq exchange in May 2019. 
Its shares surged by more than 160% on their first day of trading, making it one of the most successful initial public offerings in recent years.
However, the firm's shares have fallen since then, losing more than 70% of their value this year alone.
Last month, Beyond Meat lowered its revenue forecast for the year and said it would cut roughly 4% of its global workforce.
Chief executive Ethan Brown said the higher price of plant-based meat has slowed the company's growth, as customers around the world are faced with the rising cost of living.

business	Government is undercutting UK institutions, says former Bank governor	"Mark Carney said the government was ""working at cross-purposes with the Bank""
Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney has accused the government of ""undercutting"" the UK's key economic institutions. 
Mr Carney told the BBC the government's tax-cutting measures were ""working at some cross-purposes"" with the Bank.
He also pointed to a decision not to publish economic forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) alongside Friday's ""mini-budget"".
mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets and hit the pound.
Investors had been demanding a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to halve in value. Pension funds, which invest in bonds, were forced to start selling, sparking fears of a fresh market downturn.
Bank of England was forced to step in to calm markets and on Wednesday, said it would buy £65bn of government bonds over the next fortnight in an attempt to restore stability. 
Sterling hit a record low against the US dollar of around $1.03 on Monday. It has since risen to around $1.08 after the Bank's announcement and remained there after Prime Minister Liz Truss said she would stand by the measures announced in the mini-budget. 
f government borrowing, however, edged higher and the interest paid - or yield - on 10-year government debt rose. 
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Carney said that while the government was right to want to boost economic growth: ""There is a lag between today and when that growth might come."" 
He said: ""There was an undercutting of some of the institutions that underpin the overall approach - so not having an OBR forecast is much-commented upon and the government, I think, has accepted the need for that but that was important.""
OBR provides independent forecasts of the impact of government's plans on the economy as well as on public finances. The Treasury decided not to publish its forecasts on Friday, which fuelled market turmoil.
""Unfortunately having a partial budget, in these circumstances - tough global economy, tough financial market position, working at cross-purposes with the Bank - has led to quite dramatic moves in financial markets,"" Mr Carney said. 
reasury has subsequently said the OBR will release a full forecast when Mr Kwarteng announces his medium-term fiscal plan on 23 November.
Mr Carney also said that the government's mini-budget showed it was ""working at some cross-purposes with the Bank in terms of short-term support for the economy"".
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled the country's biggest tax package in 50 years on Friday. But the £45bn-worth of tax cuts has sparked concerns that government borrowing could surge along with rising interest rates.
Bank has a target to keep inflation at 2%. But prices are rising at their fastest rate in four decades and the Bank has been lifting interest rates to cool inflation. 
Since the mini-budget, some economists believe interest rates could rise faster and higher, to as much as 6% by next May.
At the helm of the Bank of England until 2020, Mark Carney was charged with rebuilding the reputation of British financial systems after the crash of 2008. 
While it is not usual for former governors to comment on current issues, his stark words will be a further blow to the government as it defends its tax cuts. Mr Carney has indicated that the fall-out from these plans, by contributing to market turmoil, has consequences that may damage rather than enhance prosperity.
Bank of England has been forced to inject billions of pounds into bond markets. That is after a plunge in their value threatened the viability of the pensions funds that manage workers' retirement pots. 
During times such as the the financial crisis to the pandemic, the Bank of England has, on occasion, provided emergency help to ease global shocks. Doing so to offset the consequences of domestic government policy is far more rare.
With the markets remaining uneasy, analysts say an emergency interest rate hike can't be ruled out.
Ms Truss insisted that the government's plan was ""right"".
In her first remarks since Friday's announcement, Ms Truss told the BBC: ""Of course there are elements of controversy, as there always are.""
But she said: ""This is the right plan that we've set out.""
On Wednesday, Treasury Minister Andrew Griffith said that every major country ""is dealing with exactly the same issues"" as the UK such as Russia's war with Ukraine and the effect on energy prices. 
But while Mr Carney conceded that the global economy is ""going through some difficulties"", he said that over the last week ""developments have centred around the UK"" and that recent financial turmoil was a response to the government's mini-budget.  
Mr Carney was the governor of the Bank of England for almost seven years, from July 2013 to March 2020.
Before that he led Canada's central bank for five years, where he is seen as having played a major role in helping the country avoid the worst effects of the 2008 global financial crisis.
His successor as governor, Andrew Bailey, declined to comment on Thursday on whether the Bank would make further interventions. 
Some economists - including former deputy governor Sir Charlie Bean - suggested that the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee call an emergency meeting and raise interest rates before a scheduled meeting on 3 November,  
Mr Carney said it was ""important that the system functions"" but added: ""We're talking about an interest rate meeting five weeks from now and it is important to see the persistence of the exchange rate moves, it is important to see what else the government does and take that into account.""
He added: ""This is a robust system, this is a resilient system, it has had a big knock but it will move forward.""
Bank is widely expected to raise interest rates before Mr Kwarteng announces his fiscal plan in late November. 
uld set out how the government intends to follow its own fiscal rules. The current fiscal rules state that debt should be falling as a share of the UK's gross domestic product - which is all the goods and services that the country produces - by 2024-25.
rules also dictate that by that same financial year, daily public spending should be balanced by revenues.
But it is possible that Mr Kwarteng could set out his own rules in November, changing those drawn up by his predecessor Rishi Sunak in November 2021. "	/news/business-63070485
business	Cost of living: Expanded energy bill discount scheme under way	"Households are starting to receive a larger rebate on their energy bill under the Warm Home Discount scheme but concerns remain for those missing out.
rebate was frozen at £140 for nearly a decade, but this winter it has increased to £150 and will be discounted automatically from bills.
Some pensioners and people on a low income receiving certain benefits are eligible for the discount.
But charities say some 500,000 households face missing out.
ude some people with disabilities and those in smaller homes who were previously entitled to the assistance.
government said it is prioritising those households that are most in need this winter.
Warm Home Discount has been in place in England, Wales and Scotland for some time to help people who might struggle to pay their heating bills during winter.
However, there was criticism of the system which required many people to apply to their energy company for the rebate. Those suppliers often provided the rebate on a first come, first served basis.
As energy bills started to rise, the government said the system would be reformed, extended and made more generous. Further promises of larger cost-of-living payments followed when the price of energy continued to soar.
Between now and March, £150 will automatically be taken off electricity bills by the vast majority of energy suppliers for anyone who is eligible. Those on prepayment meters may receive vouchers. In Scotland, some people who qualify through their benefits entitlement still have to apply to their supplier for the rebate.
How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch.
Some billpayers are receiving letters from their supplier to check eligibility, and a new helpline - 0800 107 8002 - is being launched.
About 2.8 million people are eligible, including:
f these groups has been reassessed and was part of a government consultation but charities have said that the results could leave thousands of people in serious difficulty.
government said that an additional 750,000 people would now qualify because they receive housing benefit, and the new system prioritised households that were most likely to struggle to heat their homes. 
However, charities National Energy Action (NEA) and Scope said that 500,000 households across England and Wales that were previously eligible will now be ruled out. 
use Disability Living Allowance and Personal Independence Payments are no longer qualifying benefits. People on low incomes, who do not receive means-tested benefits and who live in smaller, newer, houses, will also be among those losing out.
Adam Scorer, chief executive of NEA, said: ""Removing a £150 rebate from these vulnerable groups is unwelcome and an unnecessary change to a vital programme - especially during an energy crisis.""   
James Taylor, director of strategy at Scope, described the decision as ""shameful"" when disabled people were worried about the cost of running equipment such as breathing machines and powered wheelchairs. 
""Life costs a lot more when you're disabled. The government needs to provide more direct financial support now, not less, so disabled people don't freeze and starve this winter,"" he warned.
riteria differs in the various parts of Britain. The discount is not available in Northern Ireland, although some other grants may be provided to those finding it difficult to pay bills.
A statement from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We have introduced an unprecedented package of energy bills support for low-income households worth £1,200, as well as the £400 energy bill rebate and the Price Guarantee scheme, which will save the typical household around £700 this winter.
""On top of this, we are also prioritising households most in need this winter, with over three million homes across Great Britain receiving an additional £150 energy bill rebate through the Warm Home Discount, which will mean an extra 780,000 pensioners and low-income families will benefit this year compared to last.""
Warm Home Discount is different to the Winter Fuel Payment which is paid to pensioners by 13 January, and Cold Weather Payments when there are periods of freezing weather, or Winter Heating Payments in Scotland."	/news/business-63601302
business	Sri Lanka crisis: Prime minister says $5bn needed this year	"Sri Lanka's prime minister says the country needs at least $5bn (£4bn) over the next six months to pay for essential goods as it faces its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years.
Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament the money is needed for basic items such as food, fuel and fertiliser.
In May, Sri Lanka defaulted on its debts with international lenders for the first time in its history.
untry has held bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund.
On Tuesday, Mr Wickremesinghe, who is also the country's finance minister, told parliament that more money was required this year to meet Sri Lanka's basic needs.
He said the island nation, which has a population of around 22 million, requires $3.3bn for fuel imports, $900m for food, $600m for fertiliser, and $250m for cooking gas.
It comes as Sri Lankan lawmakers accepted a $55m loan for fertilisers from India's Exim Bank.
United Nations also plans to make a worldwide appeal for Sri Lanka, and has pledged $48m for food, agriculture and healthcare, Mr Wickremesinghe added.
He also warned of a slowdown in government payments to businesses and workers across the country, as funds are redirected to pay for food supplies.
""A lot of people will be without food, so the food programme we are initiating will ensure that all families, even if they have no income, they will have food,"" Mr Wickremesinghe said.
""We can have community kitchens in temples [and] churches to supply the food. The community has to get involved,"" he added.
South Asian nation will also try to renegotiate a $1.5bn financial support deal with China, Mr Wickremesinghe said.
PM Ranil Wickramasinghe: ""There won't be a hunger crisis""
Sri Lanka is struggling with its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from the UK in 1948.
untry's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, rising energy prices, and populist tax cuts.
A shortage of medicines, fuel and other essentials has also helped to push the cost of living to record highs.
Sri Lanka's official rate of inflation, the pace at which prices rise, rose by 39.1% year-on-year in May. At the same time, food prices in its largest city Colombo increased by 57.4%.
Mr Wickremesinghe is set to unveil an interim budget next month, as he faces the challenge of slashing overall government spending while still providing social welfare payments.
Last week, Sri Lanka's agriculture minister called on farmers to grow more rice as he said the country's ""food situation is becoming worse"".
government also announced an immediate increase to value added tax (VAT) from 8% to 12%. The move was expected to boost revenue by 65bn Sri Lankan rupees ($181m; £144m). It also said corporate tax would rise in October from 24% to 30%."	/news/business-61727801
business	Dunstable town centre £7m revamp finished after years of work	"mpletion of a three-year £7m project to improve a town centre will entice more investors into a market town, a local planner said.
Ian Dalgarno, from Central Bedfordshire Council, said the work in Dunstable meant it now looked ""more attractive"".
It included adding large plant pots and the removal of street furniture.
Passer-by Adam Lanford said it was ""a complete waste of money"", but Julia Wheatley thought ""it's looking pretty good"".
Work started in September 2018 to widen the pavement and remove ""clutter"" from the street - like railings and signs - and replace them with trees and foliage.
It also included the introduction of rain gardens, that soak up water, hold it in storage tanks underneath and release it back into the sewer system.
It was completed in May, with just a few ""finishing touches and minor snagging"" issues to be completed, Mr Dalgarno, the Conservative executive councillor for community services, said.
""As well as improving the ambiance of the area, it was also an engineering aspect."" 
""joined up project"" was funded by the government's Homes England scheme, National Highways, South East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnership (SEMLEP), the Local Growth Fund, and Anglian Water.
BBC spoke to people in the town centre to get their views.
Anthony Smith, joint-owner of Allframe art gallery on the High Street, said the work was a step in the right direction, although it did take a very long time.
""It definitely looks better, I think the large rust plant pots look quite pleasant, but if it will increase trade, that depends,"" he said.
""More needs to be done to entice more people in, like sorting out the car parking charges.""
Ms Wheatley, who lives and works in the town, said: ""All the pavements look decent and the pots and planting around the town is looking pretty good. 
""The traffic is actually moving much better a lot of the time with the new lights and there are some lovely little independent shops and food places around.
""We need to use what's here so we don't lose them too.""
Ophelia Lynch, in a post on the Don't Let Dunstable Die Facebook group, said: ""The car lane layouts are beyond ridiculous, it causes more traffic.
""The rust pots, as big and pointless as they are, could have been a nicer colour.""
She added that she missed the old Welcome to Dunstable signs, as she hated the new ones. 
In another comment, Deb Swinney said at first she did not like the new pots but ""they've grown on me"".
""I think the general High Street area looks much more open and welcoming without all the rails, and the pavement improvements are good.""
Mr Langford said: ""A complete waste of money, especially the traffic light changes in the centre - whoever thought that was a good idea clearly hasn't tried to use them.""
A founders of the Facebook group, Sharon Warboys and Sharon Knott said they thought most of the improvements were ""positive"". 
""The trees and flowers look wonderful and the new information boards are an improvement, the rustic flower pots will improve as the foliage matures,"" they said.
""The diagonal crossing is an improvement that allows people to walk from Church Street to West Street. 
""The negative is the road layout at the crossroads; they have reduced the lanes on some approaches.""
Mr Dalgarno said: ""We believe the work will bring more visitors and investors in, they will come into the town centre and feel like it's a town centre.
""It's to entice investors who will hopefully see Dunstable as a great place to live and work. 
""If you're looking to open a business, the investment that's gone in makes it a very attractive place to shop and visit. 
""Traffic doesn't dominate the main High Street anymore, it feels like we've given it back to the community.""
uncil said its Dunstable High Street Fun Day, taking place on Saturday, 16 July, at Middle Row Markets, from 10:00 BST, was being held to thank everyone for their patience during the works.

business	Lipstick index: Do shoppers turn to low-cost luxuries in a recession?	"Do we really buy more low-cost luxuries in a recession?
-called lipstick index, coined by Estée Lauder's Leonard Lauder, is the theory that sales of affordable luxuries rise in economic downturns.
Consumer psychologist Dr Cathrine Jansson-Boyd said there was evidence people attempt to boost their mood with small treats in difficult times.
But she said a bigger factor in what we buy is a subconscious decision about how we want other people to see us.
""Being short of money is psychologically daunting for people and the way to make yourself feel better, even if it's ever so little, is to purchase something that you think will cheer you up,"" said Dr Jansson-Boyd,  an associate professor in consumer psychology at Anglia Ruskin University. 
She said this explains why sales of alcohol and chocolate rocketed in the Covid lockdowns. 
""The purchase itself might vary depending on your personality,"" she said. 
Cardiff fashion blogger Christy Llewellyn believes she is certainly benefitting from the so-called lipstick index. 
Six months ago she launched her business Loste, selling false nails that allow people to forgo the salon to do their nails themselves at home.
""They can't afford it anymore, obviously the price of going to the salon is going up,"" she said. 
""When the news came out that bills were going to rise again there was actually a big rise in sales which was interesting.""
Christy, who blogs as Style Rarebit, identifies with wanting small treats but said her go-to more affordable luxury would be a mascara or coffee from an independent coffee shop rather than a lipstick.
""They're not going to make a huge dent whereas things like going on holidays, buying a new car, buying a really amazing pair of shoes feels like a huge spend,"" she said.  
In July, US market research group NPD said beauty stood alone as the only industry with unit sales on-the-rise this year.
UK consumer confidence in the future hit a record low in August, with GfK's Consumer Confidence index saying a ""sense of exasperation"" about the economy was the biggest driver behind the fall.
Artisan baker Alex Gooch has two coffee shops, a pizza shop and provides bread to seven Waitrose stores as well as delis, restaurants and hotels in Wales and the borders.
Despite the cost of living crisis he said business was booming, with customers still prepared to spend  £10 on his 2kg (4.4lb) sourdough and up to £4.50 for a standard-sized loaf.
""People get a lot out of going to their favourite coffee shop, reading a paper, meeting a friend - it is an integral part of wellbeing... it's the last thing people are going to consider giving up,"" said Alex, who lives in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan.
He has reason to be optimistic, having set up his business during the 2008 financial crisis and despite the current downturn he is in the process of opening two new shops.   
He said while people may think twice about making bigger purchases such as a holiday, a croissant and a cup of coffee costs about £6,  a relatively small amount of money compared to other indulgences. 
""It's a very simple thing that is actually, very, very important to people,"" he said.
""It's a treat isn't it? It's a big treat.""
Recent months have seen a surge in energy, petrol and grocery costs, then last week's mini-budget sparked a fall in the pound and a surge in borrowing costs.
""People are really feeling confused, but I think what is easy for them and very tangible is the fact that they have less money generally,"" said Dr Jansson-Boyd.
She said price ""always comes into the equation if you don't have money to spend"" but ""people actually purchase things to represent who they are"".
""Most things are no longer purchased for the practicality of them,"" she explained. 
""They're actually bought because they represent some sort of symbolic value... from which supermarket you want to be associated with to what sort of vacuum cleaner you have.
""People look at what you wear, what brands you have, what car you drive, and the handbag you use, even the suitcase you have, and we made judgments - we're not aware of making judgments because it happens subconsciously.""
She said in a downturn people tended to invest in more widely-recognisable brands and items that others get to see - so they may buy a branded lipstick that can be applied in public over a moisturiser that is usually applied at home. 
She said not having as much money as you used to also had an emotional impact that can lead to ""irrational choices"" such as impulse purchases and taking on credit card debt. 
""They're not thinking it through, they kind of want stimulation immediately,"" she said. 
""That is concerning because with interest rates going up it is actually a trap for many so it's very worrying."""	/news/uk-wales-63047913
business	Homeowners 'tearing their hair out' over rising rates and rents	"During the financial crisis in 2008, Philip Wilson says he became a somewhat reluctant landlord.
roperty market had slowed considerably so he decided to rent out, rather than sell, two properties - a flat and a house in North and West Yorkshire. 
Now, the upheaval in the mortgage market means he is being forced to push up the rent for his tenants, and is considering whether he will eventually have to sell up.
""I really feel for my tenants,"" the 64-year-old says. ""One of them is really struggling, she pays her rent in parts when she has the cash. But now I'm going to have to tell her that her rent is going up. She has been [paying] £395 a month, and it's now looking like it will go up to £450. That is quite an increase.
""But I've swallowed several interest rate rises this year without increasing rents. Now I have to pass them on. 
""Hand on heart, once this crisis is over, I'll be selling both properties. I feel sorry for my tenants but I can't be a charity.""
He is one of many people pointing out that the rising costs of mortgages affects more people than just the 100,000 or so homeowners a month whose existing fixed-rate deals are expiring.
Landlords, like Mr Wilson, are having to pass on higher costs to tenants if they are on variable rates, which have seen consistent increases throughout the year, or more expensive new fixed deals.
most obvious change in the last fortnight, following the mini-budget, has been with fixed-rate deals.
On Wednesday, the interest rate on the average two-year fixed rate mortgage hit 6% for the first time for 14 years, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts.
following day, a typical five-year fixed rate product had a rate over 6% for the first time for 12 years.
ft many people unsure and uneasy about what to do next.
Alice Heywood, a digital curator from Edinburgh, has been looking at what the increases mean for her when her current deal expires in June.
""I've been overpaying my mortgage by £100 as I'm really keen on reducing the overall term. I was doing well with my current deal. I knew interest rates would go up, of course they would, but I thought it would be an incremental hike, not an overnight jump,"" the 47-year-old says.
She is facing repayments on a new deal that are £200 a month higher than she had expected. 
""It's so gut-wrenching because I'd been doing all the right things - really trying to reduce my mortgage debt, getting a permanent and stable job. I just feel like the rug has been pulled from underneath my feet.""
While Ms Heywood's stomach has been churning, Michael Bird says he and his girlfriend have been tearing their hair out.
45-year-old from Sheffield was expecting to get close to a house purchase any day, but that is now at risk because first-time buyers down the chain have been unable to secure a mortgage at the higher rates.
""The whole process was taking ages. Now waiting to hear from our solicitors if anything can be done,"" he says.
""It's very frustrating. We have an 11-month-old sleeping in our room and were hoping to have her in her own room by now.
""Now we just have to wait again.""
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng met with officials from the major mortgage lenders on Thursday to discuss the situation.
A Treasury statement following the meeting said that ""while it is the responsibility of the sector to provide the best value for mortgage rates"", the chancellor confirmed the Treasury would ""continue to work closely with the sector"" in the weeks and months ahead.
During her speech at the Conservative Party conference, Prime Minister Liz Truss said that the government ""will do what we can"" to support homeowners. 
However, she said that the benchmark interest rate was set independently by the Bank of England."	/news/business-63160377
business	Could the UK see interest rates rise to 5%?	"Interest rates are heading upwards, with the Bank of England raising them to 2.25% on Thursday - their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis when the banking system faced collapse. At the same time the government is borrowing hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy.
It is a classic response to so called ""stagflation"", which is when economic growth slows down but prices keep rising. By putting interest rates up, the central bank seeks to cool demand and therefore ease soaring price rises. At the same time, the government steps in to support households and businesses that are struggling to get by. 
rty years ago they used to call it the ""Ken & Eddie"" show - a reference to the closely coordinated action taken by then Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George. For the last three weeks, however, it's been the ""Kwasi & Andy"" show - with the new Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and current Governor Andrew Bailey meeting twice a week to thrash out their response to the crisis.
Concerns have been raised about the independence of the Bank of England under Liz Truss's government. But some degree of acting in concert is helpful. Earlier this month, for example, the Bank stepped in to offer a funding line for cash-strapped energy suppliers in what appears to be a Treasury-inspired idea.
relationship has become a little more complicated, though. How, for example, should Mr Bailey respond to the government's recent interventions on controlling the inflation rate, which is clearly the Bank's remit?
At times, cabinet ministers have gently suggested that perhaps rates might not have gone up quite as fast as they have done. The Bank meanwhile may decide that the government's massive borrowing-funded rescue package to limit energy bills for businesses and households could in fact stoke inflation, keeping it elevated for longer and justifying higher rates. It will require a delicate balancing act.
re are other challenges too. For example, the government now needs to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds more than previously expected to fund its plans. But it will not occur at a time when the Bank of England is buying up huge quantities of government debt to support the economy, as it did after the financial crisis and during Covid (in a process known as quantitative easing, or ""QE""). 
Indeed, the Bank could be about to announce it is selling its government debts as part of the process of reversing QE. That would be a significant change.
re is the bigger picture. By raising rates to control inflation - which is currently 9.9% - the Bank is effectively putting the brakes on the economy at a time when the new government wants to boost economic growth to an annualised rate of 2.5%. The Bank's actions are also designed to cool the housing market, just as the government reportedly wants to stimulate demand with a stamp duty cut.
gger question is how much higher the government really wants the Bank to raise interest rates, even as it respects its independence to do so. 
In the US on Wednesday, the US central bank the Federal Reserve announced another jumbo rate rise, and more than that, its chair Jerome Powell signalled he would keep on raising rates and leave them at elevated levels until inflation falls to the bank's 2% target.
""We're committed to getting to a restrictive level for the Federal Funds rate [ie US base rates] and getting there pretty quickly… there's a way to go,"" said Mr Powell last night after the Fed announced its third three-quarters of a percentage point rise. The news further bolstered an already strong dollar, pushing the underperforming pound to a new 37 year-low of $1.12. 
Expectations are that US interest rates will hit 4% or 5%, and they are rising here too. 
rts of levels in the UK are now far from unthinkable. And a prime minister who spent a leadership campaign urging the Bank of England to do more on inflation could see that wish granted, although perhaps not quite at the ideal moment."	/news/business-62990423

It says only investors from ""countries that are not hostile"" will be allowed to trade bonds.

Russia had sealed off its markets in February to restrict money from leaving the country during the war.

judge has a big decision to make. Silicon Valley executives will be watching with interest. Founders rarely end up getting convicted of fraud. 
What happens to Holmes will be seen as a test case. Does corporate fraud in Silicon Valley end up with a slap on the wrist? Or does it mean serious jail time? 
We are about to find out. 
Elizabeth Holmes' long wait for a verdict is unusual. In part it's because her former business partner, and lover, Sunny Balwani, was tried after her. 
rial was separated after Holmes claimed Balwani had been controlling - and even accused him of sexual assault. Balwani has vehemently denied the accusations. 
In the summer, Balwani was also found guilty of fraud. The judge will hand out his punishment in December.
Holmes' sentencing was supposed to happen last month. 
However, in a bizarre twist the defence team claimed a key witness - former Theranos lab director Adam Rosendorff - had visited Holmes' partner Billie Evans.
Mr Evans claimed an apparently repentant Rosendorff had said that prosecutors had ""tried to make everyone look bad"" and felt ""he had done something wrong"".
But when questioned in a hastily put-together hearing, Mr Rosendorff told the judge he stood by his original testimony. 
A new date for sentencing was given - 18 November. 
Since her conviction, the last months appear to have been filled with family fun - with Holmes embracing her freedom. 
Pictures supplied to the court by Mr Evans show trips skiing and to the Grand Canyon. Baby baths and pyjama days. 
Dozens of letters have been submitted vouching for Holmes' character. 
Among them is one from Cory Booker, a US Senator for New Jersey, who wrote to the judge. 
Democrat said they'd bonded over vegan food at a dinner six years before she was charged with fraud, and they had remained friends. He appealed for clemency. 
fence has even submitted a school Q&A - in which a young Holmes says she always tries ""to do right"". 
It's a theme her legal team comes back to time and time again, that she was trying to help people, that her intentions were good. 
rosecution, though, is calling for a tough sentence for ""one of the most substantial white collar offenses Silicon Valley or any other District has seen"".
Holmes has been unfairly victimised is plain wrong. 
rosecution is also asking Holmes to pay $803m in restitution to investors.
rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes
""She preyed on hopes of her investors"", Assistant US Attorney Robert Leach said.
One investor was Eileen Lepera. A Silicon Valley secretary, she says her boss told her to invest in Theranos, tipping it as the next Apple. She put a chunk of her life savings in, only to lose everything. 
""I think she should do some prison time,"" she says. 
""A normal person just doesn't do that to another person. When they know that [fraud] is happening, they stop immediately.""
Sentencing starts at 18:00 GMT.

business	KitKat maker Nestle puts up prices again	"KitKat maker Nestle has put up its prices again due to ""unprecedented"" increases in costs. 
Swiss food giant said it had increased prices by 6.5% in the first half of this year. 
McDonald's and Coca-Cola also announced price rises this week. 
Companies are facing increased costs for things such as fuel, wages and ingredients, and consumer prices in the UK are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years.
Nestle, which also makes Cheerios and Smarties, had already increased prices by 3.1% in the last three months of 2021. 
Chief executive Mark Schneider said price increases were implemented ""in a responsible manner"". 
""We limited the impact of unprecedented inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints on our margin development through disciplined cost control and operational efficiencies,"" he added. 
Price rises were highest in North America, at 9.8%, compared with 4.9% in Europe. 
Nestle said organic sales - which strip out the impact of currency changes and acquisitions - had risen by 8.1% in the first half of the year. The firm raised its organic sales growth forecast for the year to between 7% and 8%.
Net profit fell by 11.7% to 5.2bn Swiss francs ($5.4bn; £4.5bn) as a result of one-off items, including higher taxesand write-offs of property and equipment in Russia. 
In March, Nestle stopped investment in Russia and pulled its popular brands out of the country following the invasion of Ukraine. However, it still sells essentials such as baby formula and medical nutrition products there. 
war in Ukraine has helped to push up the cost of fuel and food further, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hitting 9.4% in June, the highest level for more than 40 years. 
Some firms are also having to increase wages to attract and retain staff, with job vacancies at near record highs. However, pay increases are not keeping up with the growing cost of living. 
On Wednesday, McDonald's said it was increasing the price of its cheeseburger for the first time in more than 14 years - from 99p to £1.19 in the UK . 
It came after drinks giant Coca-Cola told Bloomberg its global prices had increased by an average of about 5% 
Earlier this week, Amazon also announced it was increasing prices for UK customers due to higher costs, with the price of its Prime subscription service rising by £1 a month from September."	/news/business-62331832
business	China Covid: Universal Resort shuts due to Beijing coronavirus cases	"Universal Resort theme park in Beijing has temporarily closed due to Covid-19 prevention measures.
Cases have been rising in the city despite having some of the world's toughest anti-coronavirus restrictions.
For yesterday, the Chinese capital - which is home to more than 21 million people - reported 19 symptomatic infections and one asymptomatic case.
China's zero-Covid policy has seen cities and attractions locked down over relatively small numbers of infections.
rk, which is part-owned by the US media giant Comcast, did not say when it would reopen, but pledged to refund or reschedule tickets.
""We will continue to assess the impact on operations and strive to resume operations as soon as possible,"" it said on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform.
""At the same time, we will continue to carry out a series of work related to epidemic prevention and control, such as deep cleaning, disinfection and nucleic acid testing,"" it added.
Some users on Weibo took issue with the short notice given to customers by the company.
""The pandemic shutdown is understandable. But why didn't you give earlier notice?"" one user asked.
Another said: ""Who is responsible for the loss if I specially took leave to visit?""
me the theme park, which was opened in September 2021, has been forced to close its gates this year. It was shut for six weeks from the start of May due to Covid measures.
Strict zero-Covid policies have seen some of China's biggest cities being locked down, including the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai.
Beijing is the only major Chinese city to have so far avoided a full lockdown.
However, infections have been rising after the national Golden Week holiday earlier this month.
Last Thursday, some housing estates and shopping centres in Beijing were locked down because of a steep rise in cases.
Other major attractions in China have been shut in recent months because of rises in Covid infections.
Earlier this year, Shanghai Disneyland was closed down for three months because of a coronavirus outbreak.
When it reopened in June, visitors had to wear face masks and stick to strict social distancing rules.
President Xi Jinping, who secured a historic third term in power at the weekend, has signalled that the country will continue to pursue its strict zero-Covid approach even as the measures have weighed on economic growth.

business	Cash popular again due to cost of living concerns, says Post Office	"Post Office branches handled increased amounts of cash in August as banks close branches and the cost of living bites.
Post Office handled £3.45bn in cash in August, the highest total since it began recording volumes five years ago.
It says it expects the trend to continue due to rising living costs and tighter budgets.
Some people say they find it easier to monitor spending by using notes and coins, rather than electronic payments.
People typically use less cash in August, the state-owned company said, but this year branches dealt with record-breaking amounts of cash. 
During the worst of the pandemic all transactions fell, but cash use dropped particularly sharply as shopkeepers preferred contactless methods.
""We expect cash transactions to continue to exceed expectations in October and for the rest of the year,"" said Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office. 
Cash transactions include personal deposits and withdrawals from post office accounts, as well as business use. 
People relied on the11,500 local Post Office branches around the country. Banks have been closing branches across the UK, leaving some communities with no access to banking services at all. 
As part of efforts to ensure individuals and businesses can still access banking services, the Post Office is running pilots of shared banking hubs in two locations, with another 13 locations also earmarked for hubs. 
Customers of most banks can already use post office counters for basic banking, but at the hubs there is a wider range of services and the banks taking part send representatives once a week to help customers.
But while the Post Office is processing more cash transactions in the short term, over the longer-term, the trend away from cash is set to continue, with UK Finance, the body representing the banking industry, forecasting cash will account for only 6% of payments by 2031.
use of notes and coins has already fallen dramatically over the last decade, from 55% of payments in 2011 to 15% last year.
for September was slightly lower at £3.35bn. It would have been even higher without the extra bank holiday for the Queen's funeral, said the Post Office. 
Post Office said personal cash withdrawals at its branches totalled £805m in August, up 0.5% compared to July, while personal cash deposits exceeded £1.4bn for the first time.

Air Balloon on the A417 at Birdlip, Gloucestershire, is being demolished to make way for a major road upgrade.
It has been called the Air Balloon for at least 220 years, and gave its name to a roundabout joining major local roads, which has become an accident blackspot. 
ub has been at risk of closure for decades, as various plans were made to change the road layout on the A417.
m at the pub says it will close at 17:00 GMT on 31 December, and thanked customers for their support on social media.
""We have loved serving you all over the years but sadly the time has come where the pub will be closing in order to make way for the new road,"" staff said on Facebook. 
""As you will understand, this is a difficult time, but we're looking forward to giving everyone a last great Christmas with us to remember."" 
Customers and passing drivers were quick to respond to The Air Balloon's announcement.
Carol Challis, the widow of late actor John Challis, tweeted: ""Goodbye to the Air Balloon or the Air 'alloon as John used to call it after the B fell off one year. Finally there is to be a new road but the pub has to be demolished to make way. On our way to London we passed it hundreds of times.""
Glyn Evans commented on Facebook: ""You've been a perfect meeting point for my family, and we have made some great memories under your roof and in your garden.""
Angela Bicknell added: My family over at least four generations have been visitors to The Air Balloon over the years.
""It will be sorely missed by all in Gloucestershire.""
ub was named The Air Balloon because Birdlip and Crickley Hill were popular launch sites when ballooning was first popularised in England in the 1780s.
It was first The Balloon, and this later became The Air Balloon.

business	EU energy rationing can't be ruled out, Shell warns	"Rationing of energy in Europe cannot be ruled out, the boss of energy giant Shell has warned, due to worries over the supply of gas from Russia.
Speaking at an energy conference, Ben van Beurden said a ""really tough winter in Europe"" was ahead, with energy prices set to see ""significant"" rises.
Energy prices jumped earlier this year after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Russia has also been accused of using gas ""as a weapon"" by limiting supplies in response to EU sanctions.
Last month, Germany moved closer to gas rationing after it triggered the ""alarm"" stage of an emergency gas plan to deal with shortages, amidst fears of tighter supplies. The highest level of the plan would allow the state to intervene and prioritise energy allocation to households and emergency services.
week, Russian natural gas supplies to Germany via the Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 1 were halted for 10 days of annual maintenance work, but there are fears that supplies may not restart.
Italy has also reported shortages in gas supply, with Italian energy giant Eni revealing last month it was only getting half of the 63 million cubic metres per day it had requested from Gazprom.
Speaking at the Aurora Spring Conference in Oxford, Mr van Beurden said: ""It will be a really tough winter in Europe.
""Some countries will fare better than others but we will all be facing a very significant escalation in energy prices.""
EU is heavily reliant on Russian fossil fuels, with Russia supplying 40% of its natural gas. It also supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil, receiving around €400bn ($430bn; £341bn) a year in return.
made moves to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in response to war Ukraine, banning most oil imports by the end of 2022. It has committed to reducing gas imports but it's proved harder to agree further measures, such as an outright ban.
Member states have been been trying to store gas during the summer ahead of higher winter demand for fuel, but Russia's latest moves to reduce supply have deepened concerns the continent may struggle to build up sufficient reserves.
Europe's gas stocks are 62.6% full and there are fears that meeting the target of at least 80% for winter will be difficult.
Several countries, such as Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands had their Russian gas deliveries suspended after they refused a Russian demand to pay in roubles.
UK imports less than 5% of its natural gas from Russia, but is reliant on Norway for a third of supplies.
re are concerns that if Russia cuts supplies to the European Union further, or the bloc boycotts purchasing gas, then competition for supplies would increase.
So while the UK would not be as badly hit by supply disruption as the EU, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand increases.
Earlier this week, the head of the UK's energy watchdog, Ofgem, warned that domestic energy bills would rise faster this winter than previously forecast.
One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than £1,200 a year to UK domestic bills in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay £3,244 a year from October, then £3,363 a year from January.

business	Fuel prices surged over bank holiday break, says RAC	"rice of petrol surged by nearly 5p a litre in the week that included the bank holiday break, the RAC says, and could soon hit 180p a litre.
motoring body said the average cost of a litre of petrol had hit a ""frightening"" 177.88p by Sunday.
Oil prices remain high due to the war in Ukraine and sanctions to reduce Europe's dependence on Russia.
In March, the government cut fuel duty by 5p a litre for a year, but the RAC called for more help for motorists.
RAC spokesperson Simon Williams, said: ""More radical government intervention is urgently needed, whether that's in the form of a further reduction in fuel duty or a VAT cut."" 
Over the week from 30 May to 5 June, average diesel prices also rose from 182.58p a litre to 185.01p.
""Sadly, we expect to see the average price of petrol break through the 180p mark this week with diesel moving further towards 190p,"" said Mr Williams.
AA fuel price spokesman Luke Bosdet said: ""Shock and awe is the only way to describe what has been happening at the pump during the half-term break.""
He added: ""The forces behind the surge have been oil jumping back above $120 a barrel for the first time since late March, combined with petrol commodity prices being boosted by summer motoring demand.""
Many UK households are struggling with the rising cost of living and the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation reached 9% in the year to April. The rise in the price of petrol and diesel was a major contributor to the increase in inflation.  
As well as the war in Ukraine, Brent crude prices remain elevated after major oil producer Saudi Arabia said on Monday that it would increase its selling price from July. "	/news/business-61704113

Fraudsters are using social media to offer fake tickets and trick unsuspecting victims out of their cash - the average loss is £410, according to Lloyds Bank.
fans pay by bank transfer, which offers no protection to consumers.
If you can't pay by credit or debit card, ""that's a big red flag that you're about to get scammed,"" the bank warned.
Cases of the scams climbed by more than two-thirds between January and June, according to Lloyds Bank data.
urge was because fraudsters took advantage of people desperate to attend live events after Covid restrictions ended.
But the bank warned that the start of the Premier League season this weekend could see another surge in the scams.
It said criminals target the biggest games which are already sold out - such as matches between the top six clubs in England, European games and internationals matches. 
With major events such as cup finals, Lloyds Bank said it had seen victims losing as much as £2,000.
mmers use social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, to offer fake tickets to sought-after matches.
-flight football in particular is popular among criminals, as they take advantage of fans' desperation to watch their team, knowing that many matches will already be sold out,
ften use bogus pictures of tickets to fool fans, or publish a made-up story about why they cannot attend the game to sound more legitimate.
Once they've snared a victim they demand payment by bank transfer, also known as 'faster payment'.
ments offer no consumer protection and are effectively the electronic equivalent of just handing over your cash to someone in the street.
Once the cash is sent, the scammers simply disappear, leaving behind an anonymous, untraceable online identity and an angry fan left out of pocket.
""The vast majority of these scams start on social media, where it's all too easy for fraudsters to use fake profiles and advertise items that simply don't exist,"" said Liz Ziegler, Lloyds Bank's retail fraud and financial crime director.
""Buying directly from the clubs or their official ticket partners is the only way to guarantee you're paying for a real ticket.""

When using a credit card, Section 75 protection means that your card provider could be responsible for compensating you if the goods or services you bought aren't as advertised.
Under chargeback rules a card provider can get your money back from the bank the money was sent to, if you do not get the goods or services you paid for.
re has also been a marked increase in purchase scams targeting tickets for concerts so music fans should be wary too.

business	The inside story of the pound's plunge and soaring mortgage costs	"It's just over a week since the new Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, presented his tax-cutting mini-budget. His aim was to kickstart economic growth. But it seems to have kickstarted a crisis of confidence, a jump in mortgage rates, and calls for a complete U-turn.
So what just happened? Here's a quick run-through of a dramatic week for the UK economy, told by the people who lived it. 
On Monday London currency trader Jordan Rochester woke up at 06:00, rolled over to check his phone and saw the pound had fallen to its lowest level on record: $1.03.
questions came flooding in: How far can it fall? Will the Bank of England do an emergency interest rate hike? What will the government do to save the pound? 
""There was a mad dash to answer these important questions to clients,"" he says.
Luckily for him, for the last few months, he has been betting against the pound, expecting it to fall.
""It's possibly been the best trade of my career, but perhaps also the least enjoyable,"" he adds. ""After all, nobody wants a recession.""
A weaker currency suggests investors' faith in a country's economic prospects is wavering. 
Although it came at a time when the dollar was already strengthening, the pound was knocked further by a mini-budget that outlined surprise tax cuts and a huge package of help with energy bills, but didn't spell out where the extra money would come from to pay for it.
It didn't come with any independent analysis of how the numbers added up, which made things worse.
fall in sterling immediately made things tougher for Mike Walley, owner of toy retailer Everything Dinosaur in Cheshire. He had a $42,000 bill to pay for imported stock.
""Had we made that payment last week it would have been about £35,000,"" he said on Monday. ""Now, because of the pound situation, it is getting on towards £39,000 that we have to pay.""
By Tuesday there were expectations that the Bank of England would have to raise interest rates to counter the extra spending in the mini-budget.
ringing off the hooks for mortgage brokers like Andrew Montlake at Coreco Partners. 
""The beginning of the week was absolutely crazy, a whirlwind of activity and confusion,"" he says.
His staff worked around the clock to help clients tie down deals before lenders pulled their products or replaced them with more expensive ones.
By the end of the week there were 40% fewer products available than before the mini-budget.
""If we spoke to a client at nine in the morning and quoted them a rate, we had to phone back two hours later and say: 'It's going in the next hour. You need to make a quick decision if you want it,'"" he says.
People about to come off fixed rates are facing huge jumps in their monthly payments, he adds.
's what is worrying Steve Kendrick, 51, from Cardiff, who feels as though he is heading for disaster.
""If interest rates rise as suggested, I will lose my home,"" he says. ""It astounds me that after everybody worked so hard through Covid, we have to go through this. It's like being stabbed in the back.""
government's strategy is likely to increase inequality and add to pressures pushing up day-to-day prices, the International Monetary Fund pointed out. It was an unusually outspoken statement from the Fund, which often bails out countries who are struggling financially.
On Wednesday the cost of government borrowing was rising to levels many economists thought were concerning.
It was a ""kneejerk"" lack of confidence, explains Lucy Coutts, investment director at JM Finn. 
She invests in government bonds, which she says are usually like sloths - they're low risk, they don't move, because lending to the UK is considered an ultra-safe bet. But some bonds fell by 20% in two days.
""These are seismic moves in very sleepy instruments,"" she says.
She was on the phone to a client when she saw news that the Bank of England had stepped in to support bond values by promising to buy up £65bn of them over the next few weeks.
""I thought, that's really serious,"" she says. But it only became clear later that the action had been absolutely necessary to avoid a panic in the pension market.
Watch: What is the Bank of England emergency about?
ks in part to that intervention, by Thursday things had begun to settle down.
Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng took to the airwaves to defend their package of measures, saying they would stick to their plan despite the criticism.
rime minister said the strategy would get the economy growing and deal with inflation - and that she was not afraid to take controversial and difficult decisions.
Watch: PM quizzed on mini-budget by BBC political editors
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng defended his mini-budget measures, saying they were ""absolutely essential"" in ""delivering much better growth outcomes for people"".
In a WhatsApp message to fellow Conservative MPs he said: ""The path we were on was unsustainable - we couldn't simply continue to raise taxes. However I totally understand the need to be credible with markets. We will show markets our plan is sound, credible and will work to drive growth.""
Lucy Coutts says she found it a ""massive reassurance"" that the prime minister had confirmed her commitment to an independent Bank of England. Government bonds recovered some of their losses.
But share prices fell sharply on the UK stock market.
And Labour, who, according to one poll have taken a 33-point lead over the Conservatives, said parliament should be recalled so the ""kamikaze"" budget could be reversed.
By Friday mortgage lenders were returning with new product offers, although the rates had shifted up a percentage point or two and brokers warned the market was in ""very choppy waters still"".
Shares had made up some lost ground too.
But after meeting the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in the morning, the prime minister and chancellor still said there would be no official independent analysis of their plans from the economic watchdog, until the next full budget, scheduled for 23 November.
Lucy Coutts said the government's credibility remained in question until they could provide an explanation of how spending would be paid for and debt would be managed over the longer term. ""Their working out, that's what we want.""
Sterling was almost back at pre-mini-budget levels by the end of Friday - good news for Mike Walley who has already managed to save a few hundred pounds by holding off on one of his dollar payments until the end of the week.
He is still worried about ""turbulent times"" in the run-up to Christmas, though.
""We understand this is all about going for growth. But what businesses really need is stability.""

business	Customers could get £100 for cutting energy use	"One energy supplier is predicting households could earn around £100 over the winter through a scheme to reduce peak-time energy use.
Octopus Energy said it expects to pay on average £4 each time a customer responds to a request to cut back.
National Grid will announce full details of the scheme, which can be adopted by all energy suppliers, later this month.
grid operator said some customers might get as much as £10 a day.
rsuade people to wait until later on to run their washing machine, tumble dryer, or dishwasher, and to not charge their electric car if demand is already high. 
me, set to start next month and run until March 2023, aims to help the UK avoid blackouts, by reducing energy consumption at peak times.
On Thursday National Grid warned homes could face three-hour rolling blackouts, if the UK is unable to secure enough gas and electricity imports, as demand rises over the colder months.
UK relies on gas to generate electricity, but the war in Ukraine has led to pressure on gas supplies across Europe.
Number Ten ruled out running a campaign being worked up by the business ministry to persuade households to consume less electricity.
But the National Grid is set to announce soon exactly how much it will pay per kilowatt hour for people cutting back when there is an acute shortfall in supply.
""Instead of cutting off whole chunks of the country if we are short of gas, we can reward people for using less energy at times of peak demand,"" Octopus chief executive Greg Jackson said.
k service will be available to homes that have smart meters installed, as long as their supplier is taking part in the scheme. There are about 14 million households with electricity smart meters in the UK.
Octopus Energy, which ran a trial of the scheme earlier this year, said there could be 25 days over the next six months when National Grid was willing to pay households to reduce their use.
Julie Byrne in Saffron Walden embraced the Octopus trial with gusto. She switched off lights, hung the towels outdoors to dry, turned the computer off, and even postponed dinner, despite her 25-year-old son rolling his eyes.
""Sometimes it was inconvenient,"" she says. ""But we worked round it.""
Her smart meter is outdoors so Julie didn't check which of her cut-backs was saving more, but she did see a small reduction in her next bill.
""It wasn't just the money. I felt I was helping,"" she said, though with the cost of living rising, she thinks, the payments are ""always going to be a plus.""
Customers who managed to cut back compared to their recent average electricity consumption would be rewarded with a payment, likely to be between £3 and £6 per kilowatt hour saved, Octopus said. 
mpensation rate was likely to be set higher on days when the energy shortfall was particularly severe, the firm said.
During Octopus' trial in February and March customers saved an average of 0.7 kilowatt hours, but were receiving much lower financial compensation, the firm said.
Under the National Grid-backed scheme, customers, including businesses, will receive an email or text a day ahead, outlining the time slot when they would be paid if they reduce their energy use, usually between 4pm and 7pm.
Mr Jackson believes the financial incentive, which is significantly higher than it was in the trial, will prove effective, noting that people regularly change their habits to make savings - even small ones.
""If you go to the supermarket and you buy stuff that's reduced to clear, you're saving less than a pound. People respond to that,"" said Mr Jackson. 
He believes there will be savings for the country as a whole as well. ""Today our system pays a fortune to have diesel and coal generation on standby.
""Every unit of energy that is saved will save on expensive standby diesel and coal.""

business	Firms warn time is running out to save UK economy	"f a business lobby group has told the government to get its ""house in order"" to ""save the economy"" as firms struggle with higher prices.
Shevaun Haviland, director-general of the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC), told a conference that time is running out to help the economy grow.
It comes after Bank of England boss Andrew Bailey said soaring inflation could hit the UK harder than elsewhere.
government said it was supporting firms to ""navigate the months ahead"".
Ms Haviland told audience members at the BCC's global annual conference that the government has ""until the Autumn budget to reset, rethink and get their house in order"".
Rising material costs, supply chain issues and worker shortages are creating a ""perfect storm"", she said.
A Treasury spokesperson said the government had ""cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of businesses"" by increasing the employment allowance and cutting fuel duty.
reasury said it was supporting British businesses through measures such as bringing in 50% business rates relief for eligible High Street businesses, and freezing an amount it uses to calculate rates which will be ""worth £4.6m over the next five years"" for firms.
Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years with UK inflation at 9.1% in May.
Figures released on Thursday showed that household finances failed to keep up with inflation in the first three months of the year, marking the first time real disposable income has fallen for four quarters in a row since records began.
Businesses are also being hit by higher prices, with fuel and energy prices at unprecedented levels.
On Wednesday, the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, warned that soaring inflation would hit the UK harder than any other major economy during the current energy crisis.
He said the UK's economy would be likely to weaken earlier and the effects would be more intense than for other countries as a result of the energy price shock and labour shortages.
Mr Bailey did not rule out the possibility of interest rates rising by half a percentage point in future to try to curb inflation. Rates are already at their highest for 13 years, at 1.25%.
""There will be circumstances in which we will have to do more [on rates],"" he said. ""We're not there yet in terms of the next meeting. We're still a month away, but that's on the table.""
BCC's Ms Haviland said that higher costs for raw materials over last summer, supply chain and shipping issues, problems in recruiting people, and future energy price rises were ""firmly putting the brakes on"" the country's economic recovery from the pandemic.
rgy price cap, which limits how much suppliers can raise the cost of household bills, went up to an unprecedented £1,971 in April for the typical household. This was a rise of about £700, and the cap is expected to rise by a further £800 a year in October.
But unlike households, the energy price cap does not apply to firms, which the BCC says means they cannot predict what bills will be from one month to the next.
Official figures released on Thursday showed that in the first three months of the year the UK's current account deficit - the gap between the value of goods and services imported compared with exports - hit the largest shortfall since records began in 1955.
ficit was £51.7bn in the January-to-March period, equivalent to 8.3% of GDP, although the Office for National Statistics advised ""caution"" over the figures as they were ""subject to higher levels of uncertainty than normal"" because of changes in the way the data is collected.
Ms Haviland spoke to Chancellor Rishi Sunak at the BCC conference, saying firms were also facing ""a lot of challenges"" in exporting to the EU following Brexit.
Mr Sunak said: ""Of course, there has been a change in our trading relationship [with the EU], that was always going to be the case, and you'll know that the government is looking at how we can ease some of those burdens further, particularly on the Northern Ireland side.""
On Monday, MPs gave their initial approval to new legislation to give ministers the power to scrap parts of the post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU. The EU opposes the move, saying it breaches international law.
Mr Sunak added that the government had plans to ""make sure our customs procedures in this country are globally best in class"".
Fears over the prospects for the UK economy have grown after latest figures showed it shrank in April.
It has led to some analysts warning the UK risks falling into a recession, which is defined as the economy shrinking for two consecutive three-month periods.
f living has pushed unions to demand pay rises, leading to some workers going out on strike in recent weeks, with more walkouts planned over the summer.
RMT Union members walked out last week in what was said to be the largest industrial action since 1989, with services across the country cancelled. 
More rail workers are set to walk out along with Royal Mail staff in July. British Airways check-in staff at Heathrow Airport have also voted to go on strike over pay.
Ms Haviland said that a solution to strikes would come from ""cooperation not confrontation, because the consequences of ongoing strikes will have a major impact on everyone"".

business	Cost of living: Inflation hits NI consumer confidence	"Consumer confidence in Northern Ireland fell sharply in the first quarter of 2022 as inflation hit household finances, a Danske Bank survey has suggested.
urvey was carried out in the second half of March with 1,003 people.
More than 40% of people expected their financial position to worsen over the next year. 
Only 18% believe their finances will be in a better position in 12 months.
In comparison a survey conducted in the final quarter of 2021 found at that time only 26% of people expected their financial position to deteriorate in the year ahead.
In terms of spending, 38% of respondents said they expected to spend less on expensive items over the next year, compared with 26% who anticipated spending more.
However, there is a broad expectation that the jobs market recovery will be sustained.
When asked about job security, 13% of people expected to become more secure in their jobs, while 61% expected no change in job security and only 8% thought their job security would worsen.
Danske Bank chief economist Conor Lambe said: ""In Northern Ireland and the wider UK, consumer spending accounts for a considerable proportion of economic activity and is therefore an important driver of economic growth.
""Inflation has already increased sharply and is likely to rise even higher in the months ahead, exerting a further squeeze on consumer spending.""
UK main rate of inflation, the Consumer Price Index, stood at 7% in March but is expected to rise higher when the April statistics are released this week.
Last week, two of Northern Ireland's biggest food companies warned consumers to expect further price rises this year.
Food production inputs like fuel, fertiliser and animal feed have experienced rapid inflation over the last year.
Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan said only about half of that inflation had been passed to consumers.
was echoed by Justin Coleman, director at Moy Park, which is one of Europe's biggest chicken producers.
""I don't think the full force of food inflation has hit retail shelves yet,"" he said. "	/news/uk-northern-ireland-61468186
business	Oil and gas industry pushes back over windfall tax	"Oil and gas producers have hit back at calls for a windfall tax on their profits, saying they are already paying more tax as a result of price rises.
Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), which represents the sector, said producers are on course to pay £7.8bn in UK tax this year.
up from £3.1bn last year. 
However political pressure is growing for a one-off additional tax to fund support for customers facing higher energy bills.
Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated the tax UK fossil fuel energy producers are expected to pay this year to be nearly twenty times the £400m paid in 2020. That year, at the start of the pandemic, prices plummeted and producers sustained losses.
But profits have soared this year after sharp price increases in energy prices, prompting calls for those ""exceptional"" profits to be subject to a windfall levy.
Labour opposition at Westminster has made that a key part of its attack on the government over Downing Street's handling of the cost of living crisis. Labour took the issue to a Commons vote on Wednesday, which the Opposition lost.
During Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said a one-off tax on oil and gas profits ""would raise billions of pounds, cutting energy bills across the country"". 
In response, Boris Johnson said he would ""look at all sensible measures"" to help families.
But he added that the Conservatives were ""not in principle in favour of higher taxation"".
Government ministers have been making the same case as the industry - that an unpredictable tax regime puts off future investment.
Companies are also countering the threat of a windfall tax by pointing to their plans to spend on further developments for oil and gas, if they are allowed to, and some are switching their emphasis to renewable energy.
Of the two British-based oil majors, BP is pledging £18bn in UK investment this decade, and Shell has between £20bn and £25bn to spend on UK energy production and systems such as vehicle charging networks.
Shell has produced a report into tax, which shows that in the most recent year unaffected by Covid the industry's effective tax rate was 35.5%, while the corporate tax rate in developed countries averages 23.5%.
Ministers have recently been pushing for further commitments from energy producers to invest, in response to the calls for a windfall tax. That has put more pressure on the industry to make its case.
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of OEUK, has written to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, warning that a windfall tax could put investment at risk. 
She said the industry shares the ""deep concern"" about the impact of rising energy prices on consumers.
""We are proud that we are able to help by contributing a predicted £7.8bn in UK taxes this year alone. 
""Those payments, equivalent to £279 per home, can help the government soften the pressure for households,"" she said.
""This year is not a one-off. Between 2021 and 2026-27 the OBR predicts our industry will pay around £23bn in UK tax.""
r emphasised the employment created by the oil and gas industry, and its importance in the transition to renewable energy.
""Our industry puts a premium on stability and predictability in the ways it is taxed and regulated,"" Ms Michie said.
""Tax increases make it more expensive to borrow money for big projects - and that can make them unviable. It's why periods of fiscal stability are associated with increased investment, whereas sudden tax increases are often followed by decreased investment."""	/news/business-61487871
business	Sri Lanka urges farmers to plant more rice amid crisis	"Sri Lanka is calling on farmers to grow more rice as it faces its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years. 
untry's agriculture minister made the appeal as he said the country's ""food situation is becoming worse"".
It comes as severe shortages of essentials, including food, helped to push inflation, the rate at which prices rise, to a new record high.
Also on Tuesday, the government raised taxes to help pay for critical purchases, including fuel and food.
f 22 million people has been hit hard by the pandemic, rising energy prices, and populist tax cuts.
A chronic shortage of foreign currency and soaring inflation has also led to a shortage of medicines, fuel and other essentials.
Agriculture minister Mahinda Amaraweera told journalists ""it is clear the food situation is becoming worse"".
""We request all farmers to step into their fields in the next five to ten days and cultivate paddy [rice],"" he added.
Sri Lankan officials have been looking for ways to boost food production, as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has warned of severe food shortages by August.
untry is also applying for assistance from a South Asian food bank, which has supplied rice and other goods to countries in need, the Financial Times newspaper reported.
Food commissioner J Krishnamoorthy told the newspaper in an interview that her department had ""just started the process"" of asking the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) for ""food bank assistance"".
Ms Krishnamoorthy added that Sri Lanka was seeking around 100,000 metric tonnes of food in the form of donations or subsidised sales.
SAARC is a grouping of eight countries in South Asia. It includes Sri Lanka and India, which is emerging as one of Sri Lanka's biggest providers of aid.
Sri Lanka's Food Commissioners Department and the SAARC did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.
PM Ranil Wickramasinghe: ""There won't be a hunger crisis""
On Tuesday, the Sri Lankan government announced an immediate increase to value added tax (VAT) from 8% to 12%. The move is expected to boost government revenue by 65bn Sri Lankan rupees ($179.9m; £142.7m).
It also said corporate tax would rise in October from 24% to 30%.
Earlier this year, then-Sri Lankan financial minister Ali Sabry told the BBC that he saw a need to raise VAT.
He added that the nation needed $4bn (£3.2bn) over the next eight months to pay for imports of daily essentials.
Also on Tuesday, official figures showed that Sri Lanka's rate of inflation rose to a record 39.1% in May, from a year ago. It had reached a previous high of 29.8% in April.
Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money since more money is now needed to buy the same items.
High rates of inflation mean that unless income increases at the same rate, people are worse off. This  may cause them to spend less as they make fewer purchases from businesses.
Last month, Sri Lanka defaulted on its debt for the first time in history, when grace period to come up with $78m of unpaid debt interest payments expired.
Defaults happen when governments are unable to meet some or all of their debt payments to creditors.
It can damage a country's reputation with investors, making it harder for it to borrow the money it needs on international markets, which can further harm confidence in its currency and economy."	/news/business-61655317

Younger people are particularly vulnerable to these cons as they try to boost their income to pay rising bills, according to banking group UK Finance.
Safety groups have also warned about dangerous, cheap, second-hand goods.
Young people are being approached on social media with offers of investments that are said to bring quick, high returns.
Fraud prevention service Cifas said that fraudsters quickly directed victims off these platforms to private emails or accounts, where their details and money were then stolen.
A survey by UK Finance suggested that more than a third (34%) of 18 to 34-year-olds said they would respond to an unprompted approach from someone offering an investment opportunity or a loan, with 30% saying they might also provide their personal or financial details to secure the arrangement.
""The rise in the cost of living can be worrying and stressful and for many, keeping on top of finances might be a struggle,"" said Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance. 
""It's important for everyone to be conscious of criminals taking advantage of people's anxieties around finances by staying alert for fraud.
""We encourage everyone to follow the advice of the Take Five campaign - always be cautious of any messages or calls you receive and stop and think before sharing your personal or financial information. Avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails or text messages.""
Recent figures from UK Finance showed that £609.8m was lost due to fraud and scams in the first half of this year.
Consumer safety charity, Electrical Safety First, is also warning younger people to be careful when buying second-hand products instead of new ones to save money.
It said more than 40% of consumers it asked in a survey were considering buying second-hand electrical items as an alternative to new products, specifically owing to the cost-of-living squeeze. That rose to two-thirds of 25 to 34-year-olds.
rity is urging everyone to perform spot checks of older, second-hand electrical goods that could present a risk due to damage, years of wear and tear or be subject to a safety recall.
""Check the product you're buying isn't recalled and that it is fitted with a UK plug. Ensure cables aren't frayed or wires exposed and always register a second-hand product when you get it home,"" said Martyn Allen, technical director of Electrical Safety First.

business	Cost of living: House prices drop by 2.3% in a month - Halifax	"UK house prices saw their biggest drop in 14 years in November, falling 2.3%, reflecting ""volatility"" in the market, according to mortgage lender Halifax.
November marks the third month in a row during which prices have fallen with potential buyers playing safe by delaying purchases.
rage UK house price in November was £285,579.
Higher mortgage rates, economic uncertainty, and the rising cost of living are all affecting the market.
ual rate of growth in property prices has now dropped from 8.2% to 4.7%.
Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said: ""While a market slowdown was expected given the known economic headwinds - and following such extensive house price inflation over the last few years, this month's fall reflects the worst of the market volatility over recent months.
""Some potential home moves have been paused as homebuyers feel increased pressure on affordability and industry data continues to suggest that many buyers and sellers are taking stock while the market continues to stabilise.""
However, she said that the falls should be put into context, given the rapid increase in property prices in the last few years.
Property prices were up more than £12,000 compared with this time last year, and £46,403 higher than in March 2020 when the Covid pandemic began.
Halifax said Wales and the South West of England had recorded particularly sharp slowdowns in annual house price growth. 
Both had been at the forefront of house price inflation during the pandemic, when the so-called race for space among buyers boosted demand for rural or coastal properties.
Halifax survey, based on the lender's own data, comes shortly after the rival Nationwide Building Society said prices fell 1.4% from October to November - the largest month-on-month fall since June 2020.
Mortgage rates are much higher than at any time during the last decade, although earlier this week, the average rate on a new, fixed-rate two or five-year deal fell below 6% for the first time for two months.
mer Aboody, director of property lender MT Finance, said: ""With another fall in property prices in November, buyers and sellers are clearly demonstrating more caution due to higher mortgage rates and the ever-rising cost of living.

business	Warning of fewer rental properties as landlords squeezed	"Renters could find it more difficult to find properties in the next year or two as landlords struggle with higher mortgage rates, MPs have heard.
Ray Boulger, from mortgage broker John Charcol, said landlords may be more reluctant to hold on to buy-to-let properties which could have a ""serious impact"" on the availability of homes.
He said the situation was particularly acute in London and South East England.
Commons Treasury Committee has been hearing from mortgage experts.
was designed to review the state of the market during and following the upheaval of recent weeks, partly as a result of former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget.
New fixed-rate mortgages have risen sharply in cost during the year, and jumped in the aftermath of the mini-budget, when investors were spooked by big tax cut pledges that were set out without specifying how they would be paid for.
Mr Boulger said that the buy-to-let sector was likely to see more ""stress"" than other areas of the mortgage market.
He said that some landlords would find it difficult in some areas to secure a mortgage of more than 50% or 60% of a property's value.
, added to tax changes which have led some landlords to consider selling up, would reduce availability for tenants, he said.
About 40% of landlords have a mortgage on their rental properties.
Earlier this week, the Nationwide Building Society said that UK house prices fell by 0.9% month-on-month in October, the first monthly decline in 15 months.
rop was the largest since June 2020, at the height of the pandemic, the mortgage lender said.
Chris Rhodes, chief finance officer from the Nationwide, said that the outlook for the housing market was ""very uncertain"".
Mr Boulger forecast a 10% to 15% drop in house prices from peak to trough, partly because the ability to borrow was being curtailed.
Joanna Elson, chief executive of debt charity the Money Advice Trust, called for a public awareness campaign to urge people to seek help if they were struggling to make mortgage repayments.
She also called for some of the requirements on financial support to help with mortgage payments to be eased. 
re is also significant pressure on renters, which made up the majority of those seeking help from the charity, she told MPs.
People tended to prioritise paying for ""the roof over their heads"", she said. 
Figures seen recently by the BBC suggest that people under 30 are now spending more than 30% of their pay on rent - marking a five-year high.

business	What Jeremy Hunt's statement means for you	"By dismantling policies from the so-called mini-budget of just a few weeks ago, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has rewritten the prospects for your finances.
From income tax to energy bills, various changes will have a direct impact on your money. 
w the latest decisions will affect you.
government's Energy Price Guarantee was originally put in place for two years - to limit the price that suppliers could charge for each unit of energy.
Now that will only be in place for six months, just to cover this winter. The Treasury will review support given from April, but Mr Hunt said there would be ""a new approach"" targeting those in the most need.
You will still pay for the gas and electricity you use. For a typical household - one that uses 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas a year, and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year - it means the annual bill will be £2,500 until next spring. Last winter it was £1,277 a year.
After that, the details will be decided by the review, and it is likely that only those with lower incomes would be supported.
Predictions from consultants Cornwall Insight suggest that, for households that do not receive any support, a typical annual energy bill could be £4,347 in the spring, dropping to £3,722 next winter. That prediction will be affected by any change in wholesale prices.
re will also be incentives to be more energy efficient.
A cut in the basic rate of income tax - which had been promised by two chancellors this year - has been cancelled.
In the spring, Rishi Sunak, when chancellor, pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024.
Kwasi Kwarteng, when chancellor, said this would be brought forward to April 2023. 
Now Jeremy Hunt has said the basic rate of income tax will stay at 20% indefinitely. This means your income tax rates will remain unchanged.
People are already facing higher bills and a higher cost of borrowing, and more people have been drawn into paying higher income tax bands, because the thresholds have been frozen - and this will continue.
roposed abolition of the 45% additional rate of tax, which is paid by people who earn more than £150,000 a year, had already been ruled out.
Income tax bands are different in Scotland, where there are five different rates.
Some people are taxed on the share dividends they receive. This tax was increased in April, but was supposed to be reversed in April next year. That reversal will now be cancelled.
Mortgage rates have been rising - a trend that was accelerated after the mini-budget.
But brokers say borrowers should not expect the dismantling of that economic statement to feed through to an immediate reversal in mortgage rates.
Lenders are likely to ""play safe"", waiting to see how the markets react to the changes, and - critically - what the Bank of England is likely to do with interest rates. Any lender dropping their rates now could also be inundated with demand.
kdrop is unchanged. Inflation is still high, and the Bank is still expected to tackle that with higher interest rates. Average rates have been unchanged in recent days.
Some of that will already be priced in by lenders, so it may be the case that mortgage rates stop rising significantly, but do not drop much in the short-term, if at all. It is difficult to make too many predictions at this stage.
One broker said we are returning to a position of facing the same challenges as the rest of the world.
Planned increases in the duty rates for beer, cider, wine and spirits will now go ahead, rather than being cancelled.
uty paid on alcohol is re-valued each year to keep pace with inflation - though it has been either cut or frozen in every budget since 2013. 
Alcoholic drinks are classed in to tax categories - beer, cider, wine, sparkling wine and spirits. There are 15 different tax rates based on type of alcohol, strength and production method.
rease in this tax from February 2023 will be worth around £600m a year.
Anyone on the major benefits - such as universal credit - should expect a rise in what they receive. However, that will not come until April. 
re is no clarity yet about whether this rise will be in line with rising prices, or the lower increase in average wages.
Mr Hunt said that would be ""difficult decisions"" to come on tax and spending - but support for the most vulnerable would be prioritised.
government had been planning to repeal the changes to the rules on off-payroll working, known as IR35, which were introduced in 2017 and 2021.
But these regulations, which have been controversial and criticised by some businesses, will now continue. 
f them is to make businesses responsible for making sure that contractors they are employing, via another company, are actually entitled to that status and should not be paid directly via payrolls. Previously, there was concern that tax was not being paid in the way it ought to have been done.
ge in the threshold of how much a property has to cost in England and Northern Ireland before stamp duty is paid from £125,000 to £250,000 will stay.
First-time buyers will pay the tax on properties costing more than £425,000. Discounted stamp duty for first-time buyers will apply up to £625,000.
Homebuyers in London and the South East of England will benefit the most from this. They pay 65% of all stamp duty as prices are higher and the tax is particularly focused on homes of more than £500,000, according to research by Zoopla. Three-quarters (76%) of stamp duty came from homes priced at more than £500,000.
National Insurance changes will also go ahead as the 1.25% rise in National Insurance will still be cancelled on 6 November. 
reasury has said the change will save nearly 28 million people an average of £330 per year.
However, the impact varies considerably depending on what you earn.
Overall, analysis by the Resolution Foundation suggests that, for a typical household, all these policies - taken together - will mean tax cuts of £290, rather than £500, driven by the scrapping of the rise in National Insurance. 
For the richest 10% of households, tax cuts have been reduced from £5,380 to £1,650, the analysis suggests.

business	Mini-budget: PM to meet head of OBR following market turmoil	"Liz Truss will meet the head of the UK's independent economic forecaster later after days of market turmoil.
In an unusual move, the prime minister and Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will meet the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to discuss the fallout after last week's mini-budget.
watchdog offered to prepare a draft forecast in time for the mini-budget but it was not taken up.
A group of MPs has called for the forecast to be released ""immediately"".
reasury Select Committee said the lack of this forecast before last Friday's announcements had ""in some part driven the lack of confidence in the markets"".
News of the meeting with OBR chairman Richard Hughes came as a new poll gave Labour a 33 percentage point lead over the Tories.
Government sources have dismissed suggestions the talks with the independent forecaster, announced late on Thursday and first reported by the Guardian, amounted to an ""emergency meeting"".
It is understood the forecast process will be discussed, as well as economic and fiscal developments since March.
Financial Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith told the BBC: ""I think a meeting between the prime minister, the chancellor and the OBR shows the importance of getting that forecast right, and it's a very welcome thing to see.""
r has asked the OBR to report back to him by 23 November - the date of his next financial statement. 
Mr Griffith added the government did not take up the OBR's offer for a draft forecast in time for the mini-budget because ""some of those growth plans are still to be brought forward"". 
Earlier on Thursday, the prime minister and chancellor defended their policy after a dramatic week that saw the pound slump against the dollar and the Bank of England forced to step in and take action.
Forecasts of the UK's economic outlook by the OBR are usually published when the government makes major financial announcements, for example on Budget day.
Conservative MP Mel Stride, who chairs the cross-party Treasury Select Committee, said in his letter on Thursday the lack of an OBR forecast had left some people with the impression the government was trying to avoid scrutiny.
He said the next forecast should be brought forward, and that the chancellor's next planned financial statement on 23 November should also be moved forward ""to as early a date as possible"", given ""the continued uncertainty within markets"".
OBR publicly confirmed it had sent the chancellor a forecast when he took office in September - and also offered to update it in line with any planned government announcements but was not commissioned to do so.
rvention from the committee came after the prime minister gave interviews to a number of BBC outlets on Thursday in which she insisted the tax cuts outlined in the mini-budget were the ""right plan"".
Speaking later on BBC Question Time, Local Government Minister Paul Scully acknowledged ""things had been really difficult"" since last week, but said the government had ""had to go further"" than simply limiting the rise in energy bills.  
""We need to make sure that the economy can grow,"" he said. ""There's no way we can just have more of the same, tax your way out of a relatively stagnant economy.""
Listen to key moments from the prime minister's eight morning interviews
Forecasts from the independent OBR give an indication of the health of the nation's finances and there have been calls for a forecast to be published in the past week.
In defending his policies to Conservative MPs, Mr Kwarteng said they were needed to stop a collapse in consumer spending - and that he was working at pace to show markets he had a ""clear plan"". 
He pledged that reforms ""on childcare, business regulations, financial services, agriculture and more"" would be set out in the next six weeks. 
His message to colleagues on WhatsApp contained a list of ""talking points"" to defend the government's handling of the economy, including that the ""government needed to act urgently"".
Speaking to BBC Two's Newsnight, Conservative MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said the government had so far failed to ""reassure the international markets that we actually really know what we want to do with the economy"".
""It's all very well getting the fiscal side of it, but you need the expenditure side to balance that,"" he said. ""They need to [say] what the debt-to-GDP ratio will be this year, next year, and in five years' time.""
Since it was announced at the end of last week, the mini-budget has faced widespread criticism, with the International Monetary Fund and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney disparaging the plan. 
On Tuesday the Bank of England said it would buy up to £65bn worth of government bonds to prevent the collapse of some pension funds.
Across all polls Labour have opened up an average 19.5% lead over the Conservatives since Ms Truss became prime minister three weeks ago. 
A new poll, by YouGov for The Times and carried out on Wednesday, found Labour had a 33-point lead.

business	Recession: Is it as bad as it sounds?	"Is the UK in recession? Probably. Does that matter?  Well, it may sound callous, but... not really.
No-one loses their job because the statistics tell us we're in a recession, or heading for one.
What matters is how an economic downturn affects people and not statistics. And you're probably wondering how it affects you, your employer or your business. While it will be very tough for a minority of people, where they lose jobs or businesses fold, the chances are that you'll be OK.
In a recession, weaker companies fail and people are put out of work. That can be because sales revenue drops, so that they can't meet their costs including the servicing of their debts. It can be because the market they're in is in decline, and they have failed to make a move into growing markets.
But most firms battle through and survive, some with reduced revenue, many with losses or reduced profits, and often with reduced employment. Some can even thrive. It's a good time to be an insolvency practitioner.
Survivor businesses can come out the other side in a leaner, more efficient shape, and in a position to pick up the market share vacated by those that haven't made it through.
Recessions and redundancies also have a happier habit of sparking companies into life. Some of the world's biggest tech giants were born in recessions.
So while there is a lot of attention paid to Gross Domestic Product, it matters as a gauge of where the economy has recently been, and how different sectors have been faring in comparison with each other.
Office for National Statistics says it is in touch with around 40,000 businesses every fortnight, using real-time surveys.  It is as thorough a survey of economic activity as we have.
But boiling down those surveys to one number - in this case a drop in output of 0.2% in the third quarter of this year, July, August and September - does not tell you how your business or employer is placed.
Putting two of these numbers together can give economists what they call a recession.
We won't know if this downturn can be given that name for another three months, but the signs are that the quarter we're now in - October to December - will see a contraction in output.  If so, that will be the second consecutive quarter of declining output from across the economy.
So in mid-February next year, we may find that we have been in a recession since last July. It is a backward-looking indicator of the economy's strength or weakness.
And the number reflects what you can already see around you, as people and businesses have changed their behaviour.  
Firms judge more forward-looking indicators to see how demand might change. If they can foresee tough times ahead in their sector, they pull back on investment, which they have been doing, and perhaps recruitment, of which more later. 
For those that look to the ""golden quarter"" leading up to the festive season to make the profit that can often keep them going through the rest of the year, decisions about stock levels had to be made by late summer.
People also adapt their behaviour.  We have heard recently from the property sector that there has been a cooling of house price inflation. Even though supply of homes into the market is well below demand, those bidding to buy are being more cautious.
most recent Royal Bank of Scotland recruitment survey reflects a fall last month in the number of permanent placements, and the first fall in temporary placements in more than two years. Recruiters may be pulling back, out of caution about what lies ahead, but more significant, the number of people looking to move jobs has fallen.  Workers tend to hunker down with what they know when things are getting tough, rather than taking risks. 
And if you have responded to rising energy bills by cutting back on expenditure elsewhere, as most of us have, this is not a result of being in a recession. Repeated in millions of homes across the country, that shift in spending, allied to lowered confidence in job security, is the cause of the recession. 
In other words, recession is not like a gathering storm that builds up somewhere else and breaks over the economy: instead, it reflects the economic decisions we can see all around us and which many of us are already making with our own finances.
So, while recessions are not catastrophes, but a normal part of the economic cycle resulting from lots of rational decisions that we ourselves are making, there are aspects of the one we're (probably) currently in that look different. Here are three.
Bank of England's assessment is that the recession began in the middle of this year, and will run through next year into the middle of 2024 - the longest recession since the were first published, nearly a century ago.
It says that it will be relatively shallow. The last two downturns we've seen have been exceptionally steep and sharp - in 2008, with a property crash leading to a financial and banking crisis, and in 2020 with the sudden jolt of a lockdown due to Covid.
financial crash left deeper scars than previous recessions, in that the banks are often the drivers of growth out of a recession, and in this case, they were badly damaged, squeezing their business clients hard, and being told to rein back on new risky lending.
What worked well, in that case, was that they were under pressure not to repossess homes where people could not afford mortgage payments. Previous recessions had seen that happen, it pushed down property prices, and worsened the short-term downturn.  However, very low interest rates since then have encouraged more lending for house purchase, pushing prices up relative to earnings and ability to pay.
Businesses have also enjoyed a long holiday from costly finance, and with interest rates rising again, some of those who took risks on debt will be left exposed.  
ONS's head of statistics told the BBC Today programme that he is surprised that 4% of firms say rising interest rates are their primary concern. They are more concerned for now about rising energy and supply costs.
September figures do not tell us much about the effects of the notorious Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget, which provoked a market spike in borrowing costs. We are more likely to see that reverberate through the October figures, to be published a month from now.
A second difference in this recession is that the jobs market starts out exceptionally tight. In other recessions, jobs are shed as companies try to cut costs or as they go bust. Often, those job cuts come later in a recession or after it has, technically, ended.
Economic orthodoxy tells us that the threat of job losses has a moderating effect on demand for higher pay.
's not evident from the current spate of strikes and threatened strikes, probably because those union members do not see their own jobs as being threatened - most are in the public sector - or they judge that employers are able to pay more than they are offering.
Unemployment is forecast by the Bank of England to rise from very low levels, just above 3% of the workforce in Scotland and just above that for the whole UK, to more than 6% across the UK.
So those calculations on pay and industrial action may yet change. For now, however, recruiters continue to search out people for vacancies, pushing up pay to do so, and taking on apprentices.
r big difference with the financial and the Covid downturns is the response from the central bank and the government.
In a typical recession, central banks cut interest rates to help borrowers get through and stimulate investment coming out the other side. But this time, with inflation to be controlled, rates are on the way up.
Also in the past two downturns, the UK government used its spending power to boost demand, aiming to counteract the contraction. That has been the orthodox response since the devastating effects of doing the opposite in the 1930s.
In 2009, VAT was cut from 17.5% to 15% (the rate on most goods was later raised to its current 20% level), £3bn of government spending on capital projects, such as roads and buildings, was brought forward, businesses were given more time to pay tax bills, and there was a ""cash for bangers"" scheme encouraging people to replace polluting older cars with cleaner new ones.
In 2020, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, opened the spending taps with the furlough scheme and support for self-employed people, with a huge programme of grants and loans for business, and the big boost necessary to get the NHS through the crisis, including (some very questionable) spend on personal protective equipment. He followed up with the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, subsidising restaurant meals for a month.
In both cases, the government faced a steep drop in tax revenue, and opted to borrow on a big scale. This time, following the fiasco of the mini-budget in September, there is pressure to bring borrowing down as a share of national income. And without growth for a forecast two years, expansion of the economy is not going to help ease that ratio.
So this time, we see a UK government stuck between the orthodox response to a recession, which is to borrow and spend to counteract it, and the market pressure and conventional Conservative approach, which is to cut borrowing and the scale of government.
We'll find out next Thursday how Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, intends to resolve that tension. If he cuts spending and raises tax too sharply in the next two years, he could worsen and lengthen the recession. Removing or sharply cutting the Energy Price Guarantee after next March would contribute to that. 
Also for political reasons, he's more likely to save the harsher stuff until after the next Westminster election, which must take place by the end of 2024."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63596804
business	Kellogg's loses court case over sugary cereal supermarket offers	"Kellogg's will not be allowed to promote sugary cereals in supermarket special offers, a court has ruled.
In-store promotions on food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar will be restricted under new rules for England.
Food giant Kellogg's had taken the government to court arguing the rules did not take into account the nutritional value of added milk.
But the Royal Courts of Justice ruled in favour of the government. Kellogg's said it was ""disappointed"".
""It makes little sense to us that consumers will be able to buy other products, like donuts and chocolate spreads, on promotion - but not many types of breakfast cereals,"" said Kellogg UK managing director, Chris Silcock.
Department of Health and Social Care said it strongly welcomed the judgement as location promotion restrictions were expected to deliver more than £57bn of health benefits. 
""Together with the volume price restrictions, these changes will protect children up and down the country from products high in saturated fat, sugar or salt,"" a spokesperson said.
From October, foods deemed high in fat, sugar or salt will be banned from prime spots such as checkouts, store entrances, aisle ends and their online equivalents. 
romotions such as buy-one-get-one-free offers has been delayed by the government for 12 months due to the cost of living crisis.
Popular Kellogg's brands such as Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes and Fruit and Fibre are classified as high sugar in their dry form.
But Kellogg's argued including added milk would change the calculation by reducing the proportion of sugar and salt content relative to the weight of the overall serving.  
mpany said independent market data showed cereals were eaten with milk or yoghurt in 92% of cases. 
But Judge Mr Justice Linden said Kellogg's cereals ""do not come with instructions for preparation which say that they should be consumed with milk"".
Mr Justice Linden said there was ""no dispute"" that breakfast cereals can be part of a healthy diet.
He added, however, that promoting the nutritional benefits of a particular breakfast cereal ""does not affect the point that if it contains excess fat, sugar or salt, that feature of the product is adverse to a child's health"".
""Nor does mixing a breakfast cereal which is high in, for example, sugar, with milk alter the fact that it is high in sugar.""
His judgement said he found no unfairness to Kellogg's and the public health case for the new rules was compelling, proportionate and rational.
Kellogg's Mr Silcock said the firm would not appeal against the judgement, but urged the government to rethink the new rules.
""By restricting the placement of items in supermarkets, people face less choice and potentially higher prices,"" he added."	/news/business-62034220
business	Post Office under pressure over victims' pay-outs	"A public inquiry into the Post Office scandal is putting pressure on the company and the government to speed up compensation payments to victims.
Chair Sir Wyn Williams will publish a progress report in the coming weeks.
If he is unhappy that the Post Office and the government are not acting on its recommendations, he will issue a formal report to Parliament. 
ribed as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history.
A public inquiry, led by the retired judge, has been examining the treatment of thousands of sub-postmasters who were made to pay their own money to cover shortfalls in accounts when a faulty IT system made it look like money was missing from their branches. 
More than 700 individuals were given criminal convictions. So far, 81 people have had their convictions quashed.
Interim payments of £100,000 have been made to most, but not all, of those who have been exonerated. No-one has yet received a full and final settlement and thousands more left out of pocket are seeking redress.
Former sub-postmaster Richard Hawkes was one of five people who were exonerated in July, 18 years after being convicted of false accounting.  
""Now the weight has been lifted, as your character is back as it should be,"" the 75 year-old told the BBC. 
But while the fight to clear his name is over, Mr Hawkes is only just beginning the process of claiming compensation.
After completing community service, Mr Hawkes eventually managed to find a job cleaning laboratory equipment, where he worked until he was 71 years old.
""Somehow we managed to hang onto the house,"" he said, although he still has a mortgage. It was only at the start of this year that he finally paid his brother back for a sum of money lent to cover debts the Post Office claimed he owed them. 
Some 15 months ago, the Post Office, and the government as its sole shareholder, apologised to sub-postmasters and promised swift and fair compensation.
However, many are still waiting. Sharon Brown, a former sub-postmaster in Sunderland and mother-of- two, was accused of theft by the Post Office in 2012 and is furious that her compensation hasn't arrived yet.
She told the BBC she has only survived thanks to the financial support of relatives, including her sister-in-law who took out a loan on her behalf. At one stage, she had to rely on credit cards to buy food for her family.
""I want my life back,"" she said. ""I want to be able to walk about and hold my head up and say finally 'I got compensation because they did me wrong'.
""They've ruined so many people's lives, it's heart-breaking.""
A Post Office spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to ensure that there is meaningful compensation for victims and that such events can never happen again.""
ublic inquiry into the Post Office scandal, which began hearing evidence in February 2021, was set up to examine who was to blame for the wrongful prosecutions and why nothing was done to prevent them. 
However, Sir Wyn became so concerned about the slow progress of compensation for sub-postmasters that he took special evidence at hearings in July. 
Sir Wyn has now decided to publish a progress update in the coming weeks, and will issue a formal report to Parliament if he's not happy those recommendations are being acted on. 
It seemed as though that pressure was bearing fruit earlier this summer, following good news at the end of June for more than 500 sub-postmasters who had previously been excluded from compensation. The then-Postal Affairs Minister Paul Scully said a scheme worth £19.5m had been arranged to ensure they did not miss out.
But since then it's been all change in the Cabinet. There's now a new minster for Postal Affairs - and victims are worried it qill be yet another delay on their route to compensation. 
Jane Hunt, who replaced Paul Scully as minister for postal affairs, declined an interview but she said she looked forward ""to continuing [Scully's] excellent work in delivering compensation for postmasters"".
A former supreme court justice has been asked to give advice to try and break the impasse between victims and the Post Office over how much should be paid. 
During the inquiry hearings the Post Office admitted that it had anticipated hundreds of applications for compensation, but had ultimately received thousands. The Post Office said it did not have enough staff to process the volume of claims, and had so far dealt with only the more straightforward claims of lower value. "	/news/business-62337045
business	EasyJet executive quits after major flight disruption	"EasyJet's chief operating officer has resigned after a series of flight cancellations and disruption at the airline in recent weeks.
rline said Peter Bellew had left ""to pursue other business opportunities"" and wished him well.
It comes after thousands of EasyJet flights have been cancelled - some at short notice.
rade union Unite last month criticised a ""lack of leadership"" at the airline and urged Mr Bellew to ""take control"".
Announcing Mr Bellew's resignation, EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the airline was ""absolutely focused on delivering a safe and reliable operation this summer"". 
He said the role of interim chief operations officer would be in the ""very capable hands of"" David Morgan ""who will provide strong leadership for the airline this summer"".
Mr Morgan has been with EasyJet since 2016 and is currently director of flight operations. He had previously led overall operations at the airline, as interim chief operating officer in 2019.
r shed thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but is now struggling to meet the rebound in demand for travel.
EasyJet has been one of the worst hit for cancellations in recent months. It has axed thousands of flights, including many on the day they were due to depart.
Late last month it said it would be making some cancellations over the summer, to build in more resilience and in response to caps imposed by London Gatwick and Amsterdam Schiphol airports. 
It said this gave customers advance notice and potential to re-book.
While it will have made use of the government's landing slot ""amnesty"" as part of this plan, EasyJet said it would not be announcing any further cancellations this week. It said the last affected customers would be told on Monday.
In optimistic quotes in EasyJet's late January trading update, its boss Johan Lundgren predicted ""a strong summer ahead"", with demand pushing capacity near to 2019 levels.  
Six months later, with Covid restrictions largely behind them, people want to go on holiday again. Demand doesn't appear to have been a problem.
But ambitions have evidently had to be scaled back. Thousands of flights have had to be cancelled.
, the airline's boss says a ""safe and reliable"" operation is the ""absolute"" focus.  
EasyJet is far from the only business affected by widespread issues hitting aviation at the moment - from staff shortages to industrial action. 
It hopes not to have to issue any further waves of cancellations, and points out it's still running up to 1,700 flights each day.
However, it has undeniably been through a challenging time of late and must be hoping that a change at the top can herald a change in performance.
It is understood just over 150,000 of the 160,000 EasyJet flights initially scheduled to run over July, August and September, will go ahead. This means roughly 10,000 have been cancelled - or about 6%.
rline said the majority of its flights were unaffected by the cancellations, with it continuing to operate up to 1,700 flights a day.
However, unions representing EasyJet cabin crew in Spain have called a series of 24-hour strikes for July in a dispute over pay.
first of the strikes took place over the weekend, and a further six days of action are due later this month. 
Shares in EasyJet, which have fallen back to the lows of March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, were trading down almost 3% after news of Mr Bellew's departure - making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 250 index.
More cancellations from a raft of airlines are expected this week as the government has given carriers until Friday to announce changes to their schedules without facing a potential penalty.

business	Energy bills: Customers can't carry cost of Ukraine war, boss says	"UK households cannot carry the cost of the Ukraine war which is set to push energy bills even higher, the boss of Octopus Energy has said.
Greg Jackson was speaking as UK households brace for average energy bills to reach a predicted £3,554 a year in October and £4,650 in January.
He called for the government to double its financial support or freeze the amount suppliers can charge for energy.
No 10 previously said there would be no new policy before a new PM is in place.
w Conservative Party leader will be announced on 5 September and will face immediate pressure to tackle the nation's energy bills.
urrent favourite, Liz Truss, has promised tax cuts and recently hinted at direct financial help for hard-pressed households.
Her rival, Rishi Sunak, has said he would introduce more targeted support for households, and has promised to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero.
upcoming jump in energy prices has prompted investment bank Citi to raise his forecast of UK inflation to 18% in early 2023.
Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently at 10.1% and the Bank of England's target is 2%.
On Friday, the energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - will be announced.
Energy prices have risen sharply because demand for gas increased when Covid restrictions eased while the war in Ukraine has disrupted supplies from Russia.
Mr Jackson, founder and chief executive of Octopus Energy Group, said: ""You can't expect the energy customers, or indeed the retailers to carry the cost of a war.""
Asked what the solution could be, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government ""could double the existing support package"".
In October, all UK households will get a £400 discount on their fuel bills and some eight million low-income households will get an additional £650.
Plans to enable households to get discounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak times are set to be announced by the National Grid in the next two weeks.
Mr Jackson also suggested a ""tariff deficit fund"" which would involve the government freezing the energy price cap roughly where it is.
government would borrow money from banks to pay the difference between the wholesale cost and the price to the consumer while energy prices were high.
money would be paid back when energy prices came down, he said.
Dale Vince, chief executive of renewable energy generator and supplier Ecotricity, told the BBC: ""The government does need to intervene we shouldn't expect customers to pay the cost of this failure and the Ukraine war.""
He said the problem pre-dated the invasion of Ukraine and there was a ""systemic failure in the energy market"". 
But he said the deficit scheme Mr Jackson had outlined would force taxpayers to foot the bill over the next decade.
""The government simply needs to step in and pick up this cost like it did in the pandemic,"" he said.
""We need £40bn to get through this winter. That's 10% of what was spent during the pandemic and that's the only thing that will really sort this problem out.""
ummer has seen forecasts, suggestions and a lot of political debate. What it has not seen is certainty.
On Friday, households will finally be told exactly by how much domestic energy bills will rise in October. Remember, individual bills will vary, depending on how much gas and electricity you use. But the percentage increase in the domestic energy price cap for England, Wales and Scotland will be official and expressed in clear terms.
Energy will be more expensive, but at least people will have some basis to plan for the financial hit.
, the uncertainty won't be over. What extra support, if any, that is provided by government won't be clear until a new prime minister is in place. Energy prices for the second half of the winter are also unclear.
Energy bosses say fundamental change in the sector doesn't come quickly, but help for householders facing soaring bills as the nights draw in cannot come quickly enough.
Meanwhile Bill Bullen, founder and chief executive of energy supplier Utilita,said that energy prices must be frozen at their current level.
""That's not going to be enough even still for those customers who are on low incomes and vulnerable, maybe have some medical dependencies so some extra help is going to be required,"" he said. 
He added: ""The reality is when you get up to £3,500 a huge number of homes won't be able to afford this.""
Mr Vince said there needed to be an overhaul of how electricity prices were decided.
""The price of gas sets the price of electricity in our country and we should break that link - other European countries are looking to do exactly that,"" he said.
""We let global commodity markets set the price that we pay for gas from our own North Sea and we are paying up to 10 times more for that right now.""
He added: ""Half of the gas that Britain uses come from our North Sea if we price cap that we take away half the problem."""	/news/business-62630787
business	Pace of UK house price rises slows to 11-month low, says ONS	"UK house prices rose at the slowest rate for 11 months, according to official figures, but property values were still up 7.8% in the year to June.
ual increase in the UK average house price slowed from 12.8% the previous month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
It reflects sharp rises in demand and prices a year ago, just ahead of the withdrawal of a stamp duty tax break.
Scotland recorded the biggest rise in house prices in the latest figures.
Property prices were up by 11.6%, compared with a 7.3% rise in England, an 8.6% increase in Wales, and a 9.6% rise in Northern Ireland.
Among the English regions, the East recorded the fastest rise (up 9.7%) with the slowest in the North East (up 3.6%).
In the rental sector, the ONS said that prices paid by tenants accelerated by 3.2% in the 12 months to July - the largest annual growth since January 2016.
rising cost of living and higher interest rates - leading to more expensive mortgages - will have an effect on the housing market. However, the ongoing mismatch between the number of homes on the market and the number of potential buyers is keeping prices relatively high.
rage UK home cost £286,000 in June, which is £20,000 higher than a year earlier, the ONS said.
Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Right now, price rises are being driven by an imbalance of supply and demand, and a shortage of property for sale. 
""However, with buyer numbers slowly falling and seller numbers rising, this will shift. Buyers are also starting to lose confidence, which is key.""
rising cost of living was not the most significant factor in the slowdown in house price rises in June.
Instead, it was the state of the market a year earlier as buyers raced to complete to take advantage of the stamp duty discounts in England and Northern Ireland.

business	Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget of tax cuts reward the wealthy, Labour says	"Watch: Labour thank Kwarteng for ""demolition"" of Tory record
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget of sweeping tax cuts would ""reward the already wealthy"" and not boost economic growth, Labour has said.
Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the plan was a Tory ""admission of 12 years of economic failure"".
measures were funded by unnecessary borrowing instead of a windfall tax on oil and gas firms, she added.
Mr Kwarteng spent billions on policies he said would shake up the UK's finances and boost economic growth.
In a statement to Parliament, Mr Kwarteng abolished the top rate of income tax for the highest earners as he unveiled the biggest package of tax cuts for decades.
His announcements included scrapping a cap on bankers' bonuses, reversing a rise in National Insurance and cutting stamp duty tax - a property purchasing tax - for some buyers.
Institute of Fiscal Studies said the richest 10% of households would gain the most from Mr Kwarteng's measures, which undo the tax rises introduced by his predecessor, Rishi Sunak.
rsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said those earning £1m annually will get a £55,000 tax cut next year.
As the UK faces a recession, rising interest rates and soaring energy bills, Ms Reeves said ""the Conservatives are the cost-of-living crisis"".
But Mr Kwarteng argued his economic vision will ""turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth"".
Liberal Democrats said the chancellor's plan was ""a recipe for disaster that will leave families suffering from soaring prices while banks and oil and gas companies rake in huge profits"".
Scottish National Party said the Tory government was ""robbing the poor to pay the rich"" and its measures do not go far enough to help people on low incomes.
Mr Kwarteng told MPs he was fulfilling new Prime Minister Liz Truss's promise to run a ""tax-cutting government"".
""For too long in this country, we have indulged in a fight over redistribution. Now, we need to focus on growth, not just how we tax and spend,"" he said in his statement.
In her response, Ms Reeves congratulated the chancellor ""on his comprehensive demolition"" of the Conservative government's record of the past 12 years. 
""Their record, their failure, their vicious circle of stagnation,"" she added.
Ms Reeves said borrowing was higher than it needed to be after the Bank of England raised interest rates and warned the UK may already be in recession. ""This is casino economics - gambling the mortgages and finances of every family in the country to keep the Tory party happy,"" Ms Reeves said.
She criticised the chancellor for refusing to release an independent forecast of how his tax changes would impact the economy, as the government usually does when it delivers major financial statements.
But because Mr Kwarteng's statement was not technically a budget, he said he would release this forecast ""in due course"" before the end of the year.
Ms Reeves said without this forecast, the chancellor's statement was ""a budget without figures, a menu without prices"", asking what he had to hide.
She referenced a tweet by US President Joe Biden, saying he was right to be ""sick and tired"" of ""tickle-down economics"", which was a ""discredited"" theory that would not ""unleash the wave of investment that we need"".
She said: ""The chancellor has made clear who his priorities are today - not a plan for growth, a plan to reward the already wealthy.
""A return to the trickle-down of the past, back to the future, not a brave new era."""	/news/uk-politics-63007423

business	Patagonia: Billionaire boss gives fashion firm away to fight climate change	"re founder of the outdoor fashion brand Patagonia has given away his company to a charitable trust. 
Yvon Chouinard said any profit not reinvested in running the business would go to fighting climate change.
massed a cult following due to sustainability moves like guaranteeing its clothes for life and offering reasonably priced repairs.
It is famous for an advert titled ""Don't buy this jacket"" asking shoppers to consider costs to the environment.
rand's website now states: ""Earth is now our only shareholder.""
Mr Chouinard has always said he ""never wanted to be a businessman"". 
A rock climbing fanatic, he started out as making metal climbing spikes for himself and his friends to wedge into rocks, before moving into clothing and eventually creating a hugely successful sportswear brand with a cult following.
Founded in 1973, Patagonia's sales were worth around $1.5bn this year, while Mr Chouinard's net worth is thought to be $1.2bn. 
But he has always shied away from his wealthy status, telling the New York Times he was ""horrified to be seen as a billionaire"".
He claimed that profits to be donated to climate causes will amount to around $100m (£87m) a year, depending on the health of the company.
""Despite its immensity, the Earth's resources are not infinite, and it's clear we've exceeded its limits,"" the entrepreneur said of his decision to give up ownership. 
firm's marketing campaigns - focused around asking people to buy only what they need - have not dampened sales and critics have argued by raising its prominence it has encouraged more spending rather than less. 
Prices are relatively high with jumpers, for example, costing around £200 and T-shirts around £40, but the company argues that the cost reflects the fact its clothes are meant to last a lifetime.
Patagonia's chairman, Charles Conn, acknowledged the higher prices but said cheap fast fashion was ""anathema"" to the brand.
""We invest in making sure we use the least water, the least dangerous chemistries and dyes, and use the least carbon in the production of our products, which often means they cost a little bit more,"" he told the BBC.  
Sandra Halliday, UK editor for FashionNetwork.com, a global fashion news website, told the BBC Mr Chouinard's move could ironically end up boosting its sales further. 
However, she said the ""maverick"" founder had always been more committed to the environment than ""simply making money"".
""If this was simply a marketing ploy it would be an inspired one, but it's not, it's actually a genuine move to try to do something better for the planet.""
Californian firm was already donating 1% of its annual sales to grassroots activists and committed to sustainable practices. But in an open letter to customers, the apparently reluctant businessman said he wanted to do more. 
Mr Chouinard said he had initially considered selling Patagonia and donating the money to charity, or taking the company public. But he said both options would have meant giving up control of the business and putting its values at risk.
Instead, the Chouinard family has transferred all ownership to two new entities. The Patagonia Purpose Trust, led by the family, remains the company's controlling shareholder but will only own 2% of its total stock, Mr Chouinard said. 
It will guide the philanthropy of the Holdfast Collective, a US charity ""dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis"" which now owns all of the non-voting stock - some 98% of the company. 
""Each year the money we make after reinvesting in the business will be distributed as a dividend to help fight the crisis,"" Mr Chouinard said. 
Patagonia combines high-end outdoor fashion with its own brand of environmental and social activism. It's a heady combination that certainly appeals to a loyal, if predominantly well-heeled following.
Part of the attraction comes from the fact that its environmentally conscious stance isn't new. It was preaching eco-awareness years before sustainable fashion became fashionable.
But it's still pretty hard to save the planet, if your business depends on selling stuff, however many recycled or renewable products you use.
By ringfencing future profits for environmental causes, Patagonia's founder Yvon Chouinard has done his best to square that circle.
But he is also clearly trying to ensure that Patagonia brand is future-proofed and can never fall into the hands of the kind of companies he has accused of greenwashing in the past.

News of the Ineos founder's interest followed a Bloomberg report in August that the Glazer family - United's current owners - were willing to sell a minority stake in the club.
Now the Glazers have confirmed they are considering selling the club as they ""explore strategic alternatives"".
United, 20-time English champions, are fifth in the Premier League under new manager Erik ten Hag, with the season currently on a break for the World Cup in Qatar.
Glazers have been criticised for their perceived lack of investment in the club, which has struggled since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 and has not won a trophy since 2017.
Born the son of a joiner in Failsworth, in Greater Manchester, Sir Jim is a boyhood fan of United.
""If the club is for sale, Jim is definitely a potential buyer,"" the 69-year-old's spokesperson told The Times in August.
""If something like this was possible, we would be interested in talking with a view to long-term ownership.""
In many ways it is a familiar modus operandi for the man once called Dr No by trade unions for his tough negotiating stance.
rough buying up and turning around cast-off parts of other businesses, Sir Jim has built up a huge fortune - although estimates of his wealth vary.
Forbes puts it at just under £11bn, whereas The Sunday Times Rich List, which lists him as the 27th wealthiest person in the UK, says it's closer to £6bn.
From operations once owned by the likes of oil giant BP, Sir Jim created a company - Ineos - whose chemicals and raw materials go into nearly everything we touch every day. 
From 194 sites across 29 countries, Ineos generates sales of around £50bn and employs more than 26,000 people. 
Its raw materials are used in everything from packaging for toiletries, medicines and food, to mobile phones and furniture.
Sir Jim has always been involved with chemicals and industry.
After graduating with a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Birmingham in 1974, he spent several years at oil firms BP and Esso before joining the fabric and chemicals producer Courtaulds.
, in 1989, he made a career-changing step into the world of private equity when he joined Advent International.
It taught Sir Jim the cut and thrust of doing deals, before he made the leap into co-owning a business himself based on what would become a well-worn strategy. 
He and fellow businessman John Hollowood bought BP's chemicals division in Hythe near Southampton for £40m in 1992. By 1994, it was valued at £100m when it floated on the London Stock Exchange.
usiness, called Inspec, went on to acquire BP's speciality chemicals business in Antwerp, Belgium. Sir Jim then left to form his own firm, Ineos, in 1998 which bought the Belgian business for £89m. 
Ineos has since grown to become a chemical powerhouse, expanding through acquisitions or by investing in controversial areas such as fracking.
Because of his decision never to float the company and thus have no City shareholders to consult, Sir Jim - who is also the majority shareholder of Ineos - has been able to move quickly on deals.
He has also earned a reputation as a tough negotiator in industrial disputes. 
Famously he faced off against unions at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant and refinery in Scotland in 2013, amid the threat of company-wide strikes over pay and pensions. 
ute - which earned Sir Jim the Bond villain moniker of Dr No - led to Ineos announcing that it would close the plant and cut 800 jobs.
However, the firm reversed its decision shortly afterwards when the Unite union agreed to a survival plan to invest £300m in the site to keep it open.
No stranger to controversy, Sir Jim attracted criticism when in 2016 Ineos imported the first ever shipment of shale gas (derived from fracking) from the US into the UK amid fierce opposition from green groups. 
He also reportedly moved from the UK to Monaco in 2020, a place that does not collect personal income tax or capital gains taxes. Sir Jim declined to comment but when asked about reports he was moving to the principality in 2019 he told the BBC that he tried to ""give back to the UK"" and had invested £2.5bn in the country.
In recent years Sir Jim's business interests have moved away from chemicals. He announced plans to build a new vehicle based on the Land Rover Defender, which was discontinued in 2016.
However, in 2020, Sir Jim, who was a Leave campaigner in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, said the new 4x4 vehicle would be built in France, ending hopes it would be made at a new plant in Wales.
In 2017, Ineos bought Belstaff, the luxury motorcycle wear maker whose jackets were once worn by actor Steve McQueen and modelled by the likes of David Beckham. Ineos also has a partnership with the Mercedes F1 team.
And in 2019, Sir Jim became the new owner of a high-profile professional cycling team, after Ineos took over the former Team Sky. The team is now called Ineos Grenadiers.
Whether or not these businesses could be classed as unloved is not certain, but Sir Jim clearly saw plenty of potential in them.
Sir Jim already has some footballing interests, as he owns French side Nice and Swiss club Lausanne-Sport.
In May, Sir Jim made an unsuccessful £4.25bn offer to buy Chelsea after owner Roman Abramovich put the London club up for sale.
At the time, he told BBC Sport he was a Manchester United fan and the reason he was not bidding for the Red Devils was because they were not for sale.

business	Elon Musk declares end to remote working at Tesla	"Elon Musk has ordered staff to return to the office full-time, declaring that working remotely is no longer acceptable.
w policy was shared in emails that were leaked to social media. 
respond to a request for comment on the messages, one of which appeared to be addressed to executives.
People who are unwilling to abide by the new rules can ""pretend to work somewhere else"" Mr Musk said on Twitter, when asked about the policy.
""Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week,"" he wrote in one of the emails. ""If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned.""
mails said staff should report to work at one of the company's main offices, ""not a remote branch office unrelated to the job duties"". 
Mr Musk added that he would personally review any requests for exemptions from the policy.
Mr Musk said working in the office full-time was what the company asks of its factory employees and in-person collaboration was critical to the firm's success.
""There are of course companies that don't require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It's been a while,"" he said in an email, one of two that was leaked and shared on social media.
""Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in.""
Companies in many industries are wrestling with whether to allow the remote work practices that exploded during the coronavirus pandemic to continue.
Some sectors, such as banking, signalled early on that they would expect staff to return to the office, while others, often in the tech industry, have said they will allow remote work indefinitely. Many places have opted for a mix.
Office occupancy in the US is at about 43%, according to data from Kastle, which runs security card access systems at thousands of buildings across the country.
Mr Musk is famously hard charging in his own attitude to work. He rarely takes holidays and during a crunch period for Tesla a few years ago, he slept on the factory floor.
""The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence,"" he wrote in one of the emails on the remote work policy.
""That is why I lived in the factory so much - so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt.""
Mr Musk was previously on the record as having a dim view of remote work, writing on Twitter earlier this year that ""all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don't actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!""
His comments raised the potential for a fresh clash of cultures with the staff at Twitter, which he is in the process of buying for $44bn (£35.3bn).
In March, the firm's chief executive Parag Agrawal said staff could continue to work from home ""forever"".
In a note to employees posted on the social media platform, Mr Agrawal said ""As we open back up, our approach remains the same. Wherever you feel most productive and creative is where you will work and that includes working from home full-time forever.""
""Office every day? That works too. Some days in office, some days from home? Of course."""	/news/business-61666339
business	Elon Musk hints at layoffs in first meeting with Twitter employees	"Multi-billionaire Elon Musk has in a meeting with Twitter employees hinted at potential job cuts if his $44bn (£35.8bn) takeover bid for the social media company is successful.
He also addressed topics like remote working, freedom of speech and potential extra-terrestrial life. 
Mr Musk was talking to staff for the first time since launching his bid for the firm in April.
He has said he may quit the deal if he is not given data about fake accounts.
On a wide-ranging video call with Twitter employees on Thursday, Mr Musk said layoffs at Twitter would depend on the company's financial situation.  
""The company does need to get healthy. Right now the costs exceed the revenue,"" he said. 
However he added: ""Anyone who's... a significant contributor should have nothing to worry about"". 
He also stated his preference for working from the office unless ""somebody is exceptional"". 
However he did not provide an update on takeover discussions and Twitter employees took to an internal communications channel to express their disappointment about his views on the business and employee compensation.
Mr Musk, who is the boss of electric vehicle maker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX, also discussed the possibility of life beyond earth although he said he has not seen ""actual evidence for aliens"".
""Can we travel to other star systems and see if there are alien civilisations?"" he asked, adding that the platform could help ""civilisation and consciousness"".
Separately, a group of employees at SpaceX - where Mr Musk is chief executive - called Mr Musk a ""frequent source of distraction and embarrassment"" in an internal letter to the company's executives on Thursday. 
Meanwhile, he was also sued for $258bn (£209bn) later in the day by a investor in the Dogecoin cryptocurrency, who accused him of running a pyramid scheme to drive up its price. 
mplaint filed in New York alleges that Mr Musk ""used his pedestal as world's richest man to operate and manipulate the Dogecoin Pyramid Scheme for profit, exposure and amusement"". 
Earlier this month, Mr Musk threatened to walk away from the takeover bid and accused Twitter of ""thwarting"" his requests to learn more about its user base.
In a letter filed with regulators, he said he was entitled to do his own measurement of spam accounts.
r formalised a dispute that had simmered for weeks after he declared the deal was ""on hold"" pending further information.
Shares in the company stood at $37.36 each at the end of New York trading on Thursday, well below Mr Musk's offer price of $54.20.

business	Suffolk family's disbelief as Wizz Air flights cancelled twice	"Families caught up in the continuing chaos at airports have expressed ""disbelief"" at having their flights cancelled with little or no notice. 
Hunt family, from Beccles, Suffolk, were supposed to fly to Larnaca in Cyprus with friends, but had their flights cancelled twice by Wizz Air. 
ustry made thousands of staff redundant during the pandemic and has struggled to recruit, leading to staff shortages and cancellations.
Wizz Air has apologised to customers.
Rachel Hunt said their first flight was cancelled after they arrived at Gatwick Airport, having left their home at 02:00 GMT on Wednesday, 1 June. 
""To get all the way to the airport and just sit there and get a text message at 08:30 to say your flight has just been cancelled, we were like 'right, now what do we do?',"" she said. 
""There was no-one from the airline there... we felt completely on our own.""
She managed to get another flight booked two days later. That time, they also booked a hotel close to Gatwick.
""We got all the way to the boarding gate only to get another message just as we were about to board the flight,"" she said. 
""I was just in disbelief, I thought once is unlucky, but twice is just ridiculous. I was in tears.""
Mrs Hunt said she had lost her mother last year and the holiday was a much needed ""bit of escapism"".
She said she was ""really disappointed"" with Wizz Air.
""I'm really, really, dissatisfied that no-one's been in touch - we've just had automated emails,"" said Mrs Hunt. 
Her husband, Sam, said there were ""people going through worse things"" but expectations could have been handled better by the airline.
After speaking to border control Mr Hunt said ""it was really apparent these flights weren't going to be fulfilled"". 
""They were able to tell us the proportion of flights that were going to be cancelled every day,"" he said.
He said it would be obvious to the flight companies too, adding they should cancel flights earlier so as to be able to deliver on others. 
""There's a calculation being made somewhere,"" he said.
""The flights have been sold, they've not been delivered. Clearly there's compensation that we will be due at some point, it seems like a strange business model."" 
family had paid £800 for flights, but reckon they are £1,000 out of pocket taking all their expenses into consideration.
Gillian Mansbridge, from Mattishall in Norfolk, managed to get to Cyprus with her family, a party of seven, including two babies, but could not get back on Friday, and had to organise four extra nights at a hotel on the Mediterranean island.
She said they finally got home on Wednesday, but were exhausted after spending days trying to contact Wizz Air and sort replacement flights and accommodation.  
""Nappies had all run out, baby milk had all run out, my medication had run out, my daughter's had run out,"" she said. 
Ms Mansbridge, who works with students with additional needs, said other holidaymakers had also been told to go to the airport only to find their second flight had been cancelled. 
She said both her and her daughter, who works in an NHS operating theatre, had had to use up more of their annual leave due to the delays getting home.
""It [cancellations] can't always be helped, but I just think to have something happen on the scale it's happened, they must have seen this coming,"" she said. 
""There are still people out there who can't get back. I would never fly with them [Wizz Air] again."" 
In a statement, Wizz Air ""sincerely apologised"" to customers.
It added: ""There is a widespread shortage in staff, in particular within air traffic control, ground operations and baggage handling, security and across airports.""

business	Deadline for Aberdeen paper mill sale passes with no deal struck	"for selling a historic Aberdeen paper mill, which went into administration with the loss of more than 300 jobs, has passed.
Stoneywood paper mill - which operated for more than 250 years - suddenly went into administration last month.
Administrators have been trying to find a buyer who would run the business as a going concern.
However, that deadline has now passed without success and assets at the site will now be sold off. 
In 2019, the business was sold to a new parent company, securing the jobs at the mill.
However, administrators were appointed in September, and a total of 301 out of the 372 members of staff in Aberdeen were made redundant.
remainder were retained to continue limited activity while the administrators explored the possibility that the mill and assets could be sold.
mill's problems were blamed on the Covid pandemic and the economic challenges facing industrial manufacturing businesses, including rising energy costs.
Administrators were also appointed at the Arjowiggins Group mill at Chartham, Kent.
joint administrators said in a statement: ""The initial sale of business deadline passed without identifying any immediately deliverable transactions to secure the sale of either UK mill as an operational facility.
""The joint administrators will continue to look for buyers, but this will now be alongside the site wind-down strategy and the sale of assets on a piecemeal basis.
""If any party has a genuine interest in acquiring both or either mill as an operational facility, then they should contact the joint administrators immediately.""
Scottish Enterprise has given the mill owners more than £12m worth of support over the last three years.

business	Avanti West Coast: Rail boss apologises for recent disruption	"f the rail operator that runs Avanti West Coast and Transpennine Express has apologised for the disruption to services experienced by passengers in recent months.
Steve Montgomery, managing director of First Rail, told the BBC the issues had been caused by a backlog of driver training during the pandemic. 
He said that because of sickness levels and drivers not working overtime, the company was not able to fill the gaps.
""We apologise to customers,"" he said.
He added: ""We understand the inconvenience this is causing people in their day to day lives. And it is something that we are trying to correct at this moment in time.""
Passengers have been enduring a prolonged period of disruption on the rail network. Avanti West Coast and Transpennine Express have come in for particular criticism for reduced timetables and cancellations.
Avanti West Coast slashed its timetables in August, with trains between London and Manchester the worst affected.
rator cut its timetable from seven trains per hour to a minimum of four on 14 August and suspended ticket sales, blaming ""severe staff shortages"".
Asked if he would acknowledge the situation across the North of England had not been good enough, Mr Montgomery said: ""I do acknowledge it, because we're cancelling too many trains"" and said he understood customers' frustration.
He said the operator employed ""more than enough drivers"", but needed to catch up on their training after the pandemic. It takes 12 to 18 months for a driver to qualify. 
Reliance on rest day or overtime working to fulfil timetables has been common practice in the rail industry for years.
Avanti said drivers suddenly stopped volunteering for overtime in the summer, prompting it to cut its timetable to reduce cancellations.
At the time, the drivers' union Aslef denied accusations of unofficial strike action and said the company should employ enough staff - but it acknowledged there had been a loss of goodwill.
Avanti is now slowly building back services and has promised a full timetable in December that does not rely on rest day working.
ranspennine does not currently have an agreement with drivers on rest day working.  Aslef has accused it of not running enough drivers to run the services it had promised.
It is running a reduced timetable between the north west of England and Scotland, and making daily cancellations across its network, both the night before and on the day.  On Thursday, more than 50 services were cancelled the night before.
Mr Montgomery insisted other train companies were also suffering from drivers not being available, and it was something that the industry had to deal with. 
""We understand that we've got a lot to do to rebuild customers' confidence"", he said, adding that the company did not want to be in the position it was in.
""We were able to cover services within Avanti, [but] we lost the ability to do that in the way that we could previously, with the loss of rest day working.
""We've got to move forward now, we can't keep looking back...we have to restore customers' confidence and that's what we're trying to do with the launch of the December timetable.""
wly appointed Rail Minister, Huw Merriman, has told the BBC the government ""absolutely sees the urgency"" of the situation with rail services in the North of England. 
""We're really determined to deliver better services up to parts of the north that have experienced the difficulties,"" said Mr Merriman.
""Part of that solution is also seeing a breakthrough and an end of the industrial relations problems, which are a large factor in the service deterioration"".
He added: ""We recognise that the services for passengers are not acceptable,"" and insisted the new Transport Secretary, Mark Harper, saw this as a priority. Mr Harper will be going to visit the Labour metro mayors in the North of England who have called for urgent intervention.
Last month, the Department for Transport warned that Avanti West Coast needed to ""drastically improve services"" after its contract to run the London to Glasgow route was extended by just six months.

business	Royal Mail warns it will put prices up again	"rices of parcels and stamps are likely to rise again as Royal Mail tries to cover higher costs, including wages, energy and fuel expenses.
firm said it would try to ""mitigate"" the costs through ""price increases and growth initiatives"".
Earlier this year, the firm hiked first class stamp prices by 10p to 95p and second class stamps by 2p to 68p.
warning comes after Royal Mail warned it was facing ""significant headwinds"" from rising costs.
It said it will need to cut costs more as a result, increasing its target to over £350m from £290m previously.
A spokeswoman said: ""We haven't made decisions on future prices, but we always carefully consider the impact on our customers and ensure that any changes help to secure the sustainability of the Universal Service.""
Royal Mail said it was also continuing to change the business to cope better as its parcel business becomes more important than letter delivery.
Letter volumes have fallen by more than 60% since their peak in 2004-05 and by about 20% since the pandemic began. Meanwhile, parcel deliveries increased during the pandemic.
Simon Thompson, chief executive of Royal Mail, said: ""As we emerge from the pandemic, the need to accelerate the transformation of our business, particularly in delivery, has become more urgent.
""Our future is as a parcels business, so we need to adapt old ways of working designed for letters and do it much more quickly to a world increasingly dominated by parcels.""
Mr Thompson said that the focus would now be to ""work at pace"" with staff and trade unions to ""reinvent this British icon for the next generations"",  give customers ""what they want"" grow the business sustainably and ""deliver long-term job security"".
rice hike warning came as the business reported an 8.8% drop in pre-tax profit to £662m for the year to the end of March.
Royal Mail is also facing an ongoing pay dispute with its largest labour union. 
In January it said around 700 management roles would be cut. The company also axed a fifth of its managers - around 2,000 posts - in June 2020, shortly after the start of the pandemic.
Earlier this year the company was heavily criticised for delivery disruptions over Christmas and January. Citizens Advice estimated that 2.5 million Royal Mail customers didn't receive important documents such as health appointments, fines or bills.
Royal Mail said the wave of Omicron infections meant that thousands of staff members had to take time off over Christmas and January. But it said the ""vast majority"" of post was delivered on time."	/news/business-61505862
business	Train strikes: Dispute still resolvable, says industry boss	"ute at the heart of strikes set to hit Britain's railways this week is resolvable, an industry boss says.
Steve Montgomery, chair of the Rail Delivery Group, said more talks were planned for Monday - and that management wanted to work with unions on pay increases and reform.
weekend, the RMT union confirmed three days of strikes would go ahead on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
Just 20% of usual services are expected to run - with knock-on disruption.
A strike will also take place across the London Underground on Tuesday, with Transport for London advising passengers to walk and cycle instead.
Mr Montgomery told BBC News that rail bosses were trying to work with trade unions ""on how to carry out modernisation and reform of the industry"" amid falling passenger numbers.
""Ultimately we do want to give our people a pay increase... but we have to get on with reform, and that helps us deliver the next phase of giving people a pay rise.""
Challenged over the apparent lack of a pay offer from many train operators, Mr Montgomery - who also runs train operator First Rail - said talks, both informal and formal, had been ongoing and discussions would continue on Monday.
""We need both parties around the table and we really require details and an acceptance that reform can go ahead,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the RMT's Mick Lynch told the BBC the union would ""run this campaign for as long as it takes to get a settlement"", potentially for six months or more.
""We're in this to get a deal - and we'll do whatever we can to protect our members and get them a square deal off the companies. But there's got to be movement from those companies.""
RMT said this weekend the strike would go ahead, after talks between the union and Network Rail - which maintains the track and runs some bigger stations - broke down.
union has said it is unhappy about stagnated pay and proposed job losses.
Mr Lynch denied the union was demanding a pay rise in line with RPI inflation - which was 11.1% in April - but said any proposed rise must reflect the higher cost of living.
He pointed out to Sky News that RPI in December, when he said a deal with Network Rail should have been struck, was 7.1%.
Mr Lynch earlier said the union had rejected a Network Rail offer of a 2% rise with a further 1% increase linked to job cuts. The RMT recently won an 8.4% pay rise on the London Underground, it said.
He said on Sunday that no new offer had been put on the table by Network Rail or rail operators.
ransport Secretary Grant Shapps dismissed a call from the RMT for ministerial intervention as a ""stunt"" - and claimed union bosses were ""gunning for"" industrial action.

Labour's shadow levelling-up secretary Lisa Nandy said the government should ""get round the table"" with rail workers.
Leaders at 13 trade unions and the Trades Union Congress jointly wrote to Mr Shapps urging him to ""help deliver a fair resolution"".
And Tory MP Jake Berry also called on ministers to try to resolve the dispute. 
""By training I'm a lawyer - and I can tell you that the only way out of a dispute is via negotiation,"" he told Times Radio.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said the government had given the railways £16bn of support and it was ""still on life support"" with passenger numbers down 25% after Covid.
rain travel was now a choice - not a necessity - and strikes could risk losing customers in the future.

business	Ofgem blamed as supplier failures lead to higher energy bills	"Energy watchdog Ofgem has been accused of allowing an industry to develop on ""shaky foundations"" in which a series of supply companies collapsed.
All billpayers will pay £94 more a year each to cover the £2.7bn cost of the failure of 28 suppliers which folded after wholesale prices soared.
National Audit Office (NAO) said Ofgem had allowed a market to develop that was vulnerable to large shocks.
regulator said it was already addressing the issues raised.
Meg Hillier, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said: ""Ofgem's approach created an energy market built on shaky foundations. As a result, many companies simply collapsed under the shock of energy price increases.
""Once again, it's the public who has to pay for the mistakes of those charged with protecting them. It's unacceptable.""
result of last year's shock was that 2.4 million customers were automatically moved to a rival company when their own supplier collapsed. Typically, according to Citizens Advice, they had to pay an extra £30 a month for the duration of their original contract, as they were shifted to a more expensive tariff.
In addition, the cost of these failures totalled £2.7bn - a tab which was spread across all billpayers in Britain, not just those of the failed companies. This is before taking into account the potentially multi-billion charge that households could face due to the collapse of Bulb Energy, which is in special administration.
NAO said that Ofgem had decided on a ""low bar"" approach for allowing new domestic energy suppliers into the market to encourage competition and choice for customers after the market had been dominated by six big companies.
regulator had then introduced tighter rules for new entrants from 2019, but not for existing suppliers until 2021.
As a result, many suppliers lacked the financial resilience to deal with the six-fold increase in wholesale prices seen last year, the NAO said.
""By allowing so many suppliers with weak finances to enter the market, and by failing to imagine that there could be a long period of volatility in energy prices, Ofgem allowed a market to develop that was vulnerable to large-scale shocks,"" said Gareth Davies, head of the NAO.
""Consumers have borne the brunt of supplier failures at a time when many households are already under significant financial strain having seen their bills go up to record levels. A supplier market must be developed that truly works for consumers,"" Mr Davies said.
Ofgem is making changes after a review it commissioned came to many of the same conclusions.
""We are already working hard to address all of the issues raised,"" a spokesman for the regulator said. ""While the once-in-a-generation global energy price shock would have resulted in market exits under any regulatory framework, we have already been clear that suppliers and Ofgem's financial resilience regime were not robust enough. 
""While no regulator can, or should, guarantee companies will not fail in the future, we will continue to take a whole-market approach to further strengthen the regulatory regime, ensuring a fair and robust market for consumers which keeps costs fair as we move away from fossils fuels and towards affordable, green, home-grown energy.""
NAO said concerns had been raised that Ofgem's reforms could limit new entrants and innovative ideas in the future.
A typical household gas and electricity bill - governed by the energy price cap in England, Wales and Scotland has risen sharply, and now stands at about £2,000 a year.

business	Business energy prices: 'Our energy bill was a real concern'	"Businesses have been mulling over the announcement of a new government package to help with their gas and electric bills, which could see them cut by around half their expected level this winter. Many companies say it will help them, as well as their suppliers and customers, but others feel the support does not go far enough.
Four business owners in the East of England give us their views.
Wendy Timewell, manager at Hotel Wroxham in Hoveton, Norfolk, says she is ""very relieved"" help has been announced.
She says: ""I'm absolutely delighted the government has stepped in and are helping business throughout the country.
""I haven't looked at the finer points but it looks promising.""
At the moment the hotel pays about £35,000 a year on its energy bill, but was told by its supplier the bill would have gone up to £170,000.
She says it ""was a real concern [for me] and everyone working at the hotel"".
""It looks like our bills won't be going up so considerably and it'll be a real lifeline for us,"" she adds.
Rick Sheepshanks, managing director of Stokes Sauces based near Woodbridge, Suffolk, says the announcement of support was not a ""huge surprise"".
""It's very welcome and I think it'll be hugely beneficial to businesses,"" he says.
""I think businesses were in a dodgy place and it's alleviated that worry and concern, so now life will go forward.""
He says the package will not only help his business but also ""the people who supply us with the raw ingredients - we've seen big price increases and shortages of products"".
""All of these things have compressed and made difficult trading conditions,"" Mr Sheepshanks says.
""I think there'll be a lot of people taking a metaphoric big breath"".
from the government is set to last for six months and he says ""the general feeling is that in six months' time a lot of things will have changed"".
""It's exactly the right thing for the government to do, it takes away the fear,"" he adds.
Adrian Groves, owner of Red Kite Art and Framing in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, says he has been trying to cut his energy bills but cannot use less electricity.
""It's not possible in a business like this which is very visual,"" he says.
""Once we close the shop at the end of the day, it's important to have good light in the window. If we had to cut that back it would really affect business.""
On the government support package, he says: ""I'm grateful like many businesses that they've done something because this has been going on a long while.
""The problem is I don't think they've gone far enough.""
He says the government should have also looked at ""cutting VAT or decoupling gas and electricity supplies"" to reduce bills further.

Matt Hemsley, owner of Matt's Maps and Repairs, a vehicle maintenance and modifications workshop, says rising energy bills both for the company and customers are having an effect on the business.
About two months ago he downsized to work out of one unit in his Ipswich base instead of four, which will save the company about £2,000 a month.
Despite that, he says: ""We're going to have put our prices up to cover our bills going up, so it's a ripple effect.""
He says the government package ""is good because every little saving does help and hopefully it'll help other people out, and means they spend money at other companies"".
Mr Hemsley says he increasingly sees people carrying out less regular maintenance to their cars and only bringing them in when there is a major fault, due to the rising cost of living.

business	Major tampon makers pledge to tackle US shortages	"Major tampon manufacturers in the United States have pledged to make more of the sanitary products to address shortages in the country.
One firm told the BBC the pandemic had caused staff shortages at its plants.
Social media users have been posting about their experiences as they struggle to find sanitary products.
One Reddit user said they visited eight stores to find tampons with a cardboard applicator, before deciding to buy them online ""at a noticeable mark-up"".
It comes as the war in Ukraine is making the raw materials used in sanitary products more costly.
rtage is also adding to concerns that supply chain disruptions could further push up prices for essential goods around the world.
A spokesperson for Edgewell Personal Care, which makes Playtex and o.b. tampons, said that its stocks have been ""impacted due to extensive workforce shortages caused by two separate Omicron surges in the US and Canada in late 2021 and early 2022, respectively"".
""We have been operating our manufacturing facilities around the clock to build back inventory and anticipate returning to normal levels in the coming weeks,"" the spokesperson added.
Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble (P&G), the maker of the Tampax tampon brand, said in a statement that it was ""working hard to ramp up production"".
""We can assure you this is a temporary situation,"" said the company, which sells around 4.5bn boxes of tampons globally each year. 
P&G's chief financial officer, Andre Schulten, said at a recent earnings call that it has been ""costly and highly volatile"" to acquire raw materials such as cotton and plastic for tampons.
""It is so important at this point for people to buy only what they need. I am not a supply chain expert but we know that some of the shortages we all experienced early in the pandemic were due to hoarding,"" Elise Joy, the co-founder and executive director of US charity Girls Helping Girls Period, said.
""Menstrual products are not a luxury item, and if we all take or buy what we need it will go a long way to making sure more people can get basic supplies,"" she added.
A spokesperson for the US pharmacy chain Walgreens told the BBC that it was ""experiencing some temporary brand-specific tampon shortage in certain geographies"". 
""While we will continue to have products at shelf and online, it may only be in specific brands while we navigate the supply disruption,"" the spokesperson added.

business	Starbucks to quit Russia but pay six months' wages	"Starbucks is leaving Russia after 15 years, the latest Western corporation to quit the country after the war in Ukraine.
ffee chain will now retreat entirely from the Russian market, after suspending trading there in March.
It said it would continue to pay nearly 2,000 staff working at its shops in the country for six months.
Starbucks joins firms such as McDonald's and Renault in permanently exiting the country.
US and Western allies responded to the war by hitting Russia with wide ranging economic sanctions aimed at isolating it economically and cutting it off from the global financial system. The rules make it difficult for Western companies to operate there.
Starbucks entered Russia in 2007 and had grown to include 130 coffee shops, owned and operated by a licensee.
mpany had stopped shipments to Russia in March. It said it had now ""made the decision to exit and no longer have a brand presence in the market"".
It did not give details of the financial impact of the decision, but said it would provide assistance to its staff ""to transition to new opportunities outside of Starbucks"".
A spokeswoman for Starbucks said the stores would close.
Kuwait-based Alshaya Group, which owns and operates the Starbucks stores, said the decision to leave was a ""Starbucks announcement"" and referred questions to the coffee chain.  It did not say whether it would seek to sell its stores or reopen under a new brand.     
Last week, McDonald's announced that it was selling its nearly 850 restaurants in Russia to a current licensee, Russian businessman Alexander Govor, who is expected to rebrand the restaurants.
Earlier this month, French carmaker Renault also said its business had been nationalised and would be run by Russian government entities, who said they hoped to revive production under a Soviet-era car brand.
mayor of Moscow last month estimated that about 200,000 people in that city alone risked losing their jobs as Western companies left the country."	/news/business-61555306

ude cuts to stamp duty and income tax, reversing a recent rise in National Insurance, ending the cap on bankers' bonuses, and scrapping a planned increase in corporation tax.
We asked households and businesses how the plans would make a difference to them.
Raj Patel, 65, is the owner of restaurant Vegetarian Food Studio in Grangetown, Cardiff.
He says there is ""nothing for small business"" in the government plans.
""This budget is for the rich,"" he says. ""Everything is for the rich, not for the poor.""
He says scrapping the planned rise in corporation tax would help big business, but not his restaurant.
""If you don't make a big profit, it's not going to make a difference.""
Raj is due to sign a 10-year lease on his restaurant in December, but is wary of doing so because he doesn't know if he can pay the rent. His landlord could take him to court if that happened.
Due to food, fuel and energy price rises, he recently put the prices in his restaurant up by £1 per dish. However, over two months, the amount of money the business took dropped by more than a third, and he is worried that this could get worse as people tighten their belts.
""We'll be lucky to keep our heads above water,"" he says.
Wendy Timewell, manager at Hotel Wroxham in Hoveton, Norfolk, says the government plans ""will certainly help"".
""I think the government has done a good job,"" she says.
ut to National Insurance ""will help hugely"", both for the business, which since April had been having to make higher contributions, and for employees, who would get more take-home wages.
In addition, government support on energy bills will help, although it is still unclear by exactly how much.
Wendy says she is ""really grateful for all the things the government has done"", and that the support will help her cope with ""spiralling costs"", including food, energy and fuel.
However, despite the hotel being in a strong position, she is still apprehensive about what will happen over the winter.
""We're going into the unknown,"" she says. ""We're not sure how [price rises] will affect the general public. It's terrifying.""
One of the first ways people look to save money is by spending less on hospitality, she says.
""Only the strong will survive. The top earners will be fine.""
However, businesses that had not been prudent or had been hit hard by the pandemic could go under, Wendy believes.
Hospitality firms are ""still paying out huge amounts of Covid debt"", she says, while the government has started ""aggressively going after businesses for payment"".
Chrissy Thornton runs the Disability Families of Middleton charity in Leeds on a voluntary basis and looks after her two grandchildren.
She was hopeful the government would provide her with help in the mini-budget. 
But at home on Friday, she voiced her disappointment at the measures.
Chrissy gets income support benefit, alongside disability living allowance and carer's allowance as her grandson has multiple conditions, including Raynaud Syndrome. 
She can't see anything in the announcement to benefit her.
""The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer. People are struggling, it's getting worse,"" she says.
""My heart goes out to the elderly and vulnerable and those who are doing two jobs and still can't afford to provide for themselves.""
Lesley, a nurse from Staffordshire, who didn't want to giver her surname, is in her 50s.
She says the government plans ""don't feel like they're going to make a big difference"" to many people's lives.
ut to National Insurance will help, but many people will still be struggling, she says.
She is particularly concerned about energy bills, saying she is ""worried about how much further it's going to go up"" in October, even with the government's Energy Price Guarantee scheme.
""My husband and I are already talking about how much of the winter we could manage without the heating on,"" she says.
""You don't think in this day and age you'd be saying: 'How many blankets do I need to put around my knees?'""
Lesley is worried about elderly relatives getting cold and about discharging elderly patients.
""It puts pressure on us as nurses,"" she says. ""If we discharge them, we think: 'Are they going to be sat at home, freezing cold?'""
Lesley's husband is disabled, and she is the main income-earner in her household.
She is noticing higher food prices and has started shopping more at discounters. 
""We're thinking: 'What do we really need?'"" she says. ""It's changed my shopping practices. I used to go out and not even look at the prices of things.""

More than half of those surveyed expect their financial position to worsen over the next year.
mpared to 40% who had negative expectations in the first quarter and 26% in the final quarter of 2021.
urvey of 1,000 people was carried out in the second half of June.
Danske Bank chief economist Conor Lambe said: ""In the month our survey was conducted, the rate of inflation in the UK hit a multi-decade high of 9.4% 
""This high inflation was the largest driver of the fall in consumer confidence and, looking forward, it's likely that consumer price inflation will rise even higher.""
In terms of spending, 49% of respondents said they expected to spend less on expensive items over the next year, compared to 38% in the first quarter.
However, there is still a broad expectation that the jobs market recovery will be sustained.
When asked about job security, 60% expected no change in job security and only 9% thought their job security would worsen, largely unchanged since the last survey.
most recent official figures for the job market suggested that companies were still recruiting in June.
Company payrolls hit a new record high of 775,400, the 10th consecutive month of growth.
fficial data also suggested that pay rises in Northern Ireland were not keeping up with the rate of inflation, which stands at 9.4%.
HMRC earnings data suggests the typical employee has seen their pay increase by 6.7% over the last year.
Meanwhile analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank suggests that inflation could peak at 15% in the first quarter of next year.

business	Flights will be more expensive, says IATA's Willie Walsh	"rice of airline tickets will go up ""without doubt"" as fuel costs rise, an air industry boss has warned.
Oil prices have jumped as economies recover from the Covid pandemic and due to the war in Ukraine.
will be passed on to consumers, Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said.
x-British Airways boss also said Heathrow Airport ""should have prepared better"" to avoid recent disruption.
But Heathrow said Mr Walsh's comments were ""ill-informed"".
Holidaymakers need to be prepared for the cost of flights to go up, Mr Walsh told the BBC Sunday Morning programme.
""Flying will be more expensive for consumers, without doubt"", he said, adding that the ""high price of oil"" will be ""reflected in higher ticket prices"".
Oil prices were already rising as demand picked up again in economies that had started recovering from the Covid pandemic.
fallout from the war in Ukraine has pushed prices up further. The US has announced a complete ban on oil imports from Russia, with the UK is to phase out Russian supplies by the end of the year.
European Union leaders have said they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022.
means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to higher prices.
Mr Walsh said fuel prices were at record highs, and that ""oil is the single biggest element of an airline's cost base"".
""It's inevitable that ultimately the high oil prices will be passed through to consumers in higher ticket prices.""
Alongside ticket price rises, UK airline passengers have had to deal with flight cancellations amid major disruption at some airports, including at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester.
Mr Walsh said passengers whose flights are cancelled may not have to pay more to rebook.
But he said airports which ""cannot cope"" should adjust their schedules now, ""so that they can accommodate as many people as possible"".
He singled out Heathrow in particular which has had problems recently with aircraft fuelling and its baggage system.
""Heathrow definitely should have prepared better,"" Mr Walsh said. 
""They were arguing that airlines should be operating at least 80% of their slots through the summer period. 
""They clearly did not provide sufficient resources to deal with that level of activity, so you would have to be critical of Heathrow.""
Mr Walsh admitted that many of the issues affecting airlines and airports were caused by staffing problems, but said he had ""no regrets"" about making deep cuts to British Airways' headcount during the pandemic, when he was the boss of the airline.
Heathrow Airport hit back at Mr Walsh's comments on Sunday.
""Aviation is under considerable pressure as demand ramps up - at Heathrow we've faced 40 years of growth in just four months - and what we need is collaborative working and investment in services to protect passengers, not ill-informed comments from retired airline bosses seeking to justify their own bonuses,"" said a Heathrow spokesperson.
""Unlike Mr Walsh, our overriding concern is not a blame game or abdication of responsibility, but what is in passengers' best interest.""
kesperson added that Heathrow had requested that airlines ""limit demand in line with capacity and this has enabled the vast majority of travellers to get away smoothly in recent months"".
""The most significant risk to travel remains airspace constraints across Europe and a lack of airline ground handling staff.
""We will work closely with all our airport partners and take action where needed, to ensure we can give passengers the safe and reliable journey they deserve this summer,"" the spokesperson said."	/news/business-62112204
business	Mercedes recalls almost 1m cars over faulty brakes	"German carmaker Mercedes-Benz is recalling almost 1m older vehicles from around the world because of potential problems with their braking system.
Over the weekend, the company said it will contact owners of the vehicles as their brakes may be affected by what it called ""advanced corrosion"".
recall affects a total of 993,407 vehicles, including 70,000 in Germany.
Mercedes recalled a similar number of cars last year over a safety issue with their emergency call system.
mpany said the vehicles in the latest recall were built between 2004 and 2015 and were from its ML and GL series of SUVs and R-Class luxury minivans.
""We have found that in some of those vehicles, the function of the brake booster could be affected by advanced corrosion in the joint area of the housing,"" Mercedes said in a statement on Saturday.
""It might be possible for a particularly strong or hard braking manoeuvre to cause mechanical damage to the brake booster,"" it said.
""In such a very rare case, it would not be possible to decelerate the vehicle via the service brake. Thus the risk of a crash or injury would be increased,"" it added.
Mercedes said it is starting the recall immediately and that the process would involve inspecting the potentially faulty vehicles and replacing parts if necessary.
Last February, the company recalled over 1m cars because of a defect in its ""eCall"" feature, which alerts emergency services of an accident and relays the vehicle's location.
fect meant it was possible that a wrong location could be sent.
Because the problem was software-related, the fix was mostly done ""over the air"" - via a wireless download using the car's existing mobile data connection.
Call system is mandatory in the European Union for all cars sold since 2018.

business	Hershey sued in US over metal in dark chocolate claim	"Chocolate manufacturer Hershey has been sued in the US over claims the firm is selling products containing harmful levels of metal.
wsuit brought by Christopher Lazazzaro alleges the firm misled consumers by failing to disclose the quantities of lead and cadmium in three dark chocolate bars.
He claimed he would not have purchased the products if he had been aware.
Hershey's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Some studies suggest that the antioxidants and relatively low levels of sugar in dark chocolate could help prevent heart disease.
But the lawsuit refers to recent findings by US magazine Consumer Reports (CR), which tested 28 dark chocolate bars for lead and cadmium.
magazine alleged that 23 of them, including chocolate from Hershey, Godiva and Lindt, contained ""comparatively higher levels"" of the metals.
""For 23 of the bars, eating just an ounce (28g) a day would put an adult over a level that public health authorities and CR's experts say may be harmful for at least one of those heavy metals,"" it claimed.
In particular, Hershey's Special Dark bar and Lily's 70% bar were high in lead, while Lily's 85% bar was high in lead and cadmium.
""Any food can contain heavy metals if they are present in the soil in high concentration,"" nutritionist Sheeba Majmudar told the BBC.
""Currently there are no food laws stating that all food batches need to be tested - until they make you sick. While no level of toxins is safe, it is always the 'buyer beware' slogan that comes to mind,"" she added.
Mr Lazazzaro's lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in a federal court in New York, alleges that he would not have bought or wanted to pay less for the Hershey's Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate, Lily's Extra Dark Chocolate 70% Cocoa and Lily's Extreme Dark Chocolate bars.
Hershey bought low-sugar treat maker Lily's last June, calling it ""a great addition to Hershey's growing portfolio of better-for-you snacking brands"".
""Consumers rely on [Hershey] to be truthful regarding the ingredients,"" the lawsuit argues.
It adds that ""people are concerned with what is in the food that they are putting into their bodies,"" while parents and caregivers are ""concerned with what they are feeding to children in their care"".
Mr Lazazzaro is seeking at least $5m (£4.2m) in damages from Hershey in the proposed class action lawsuit.
Both Hershey and Mr Lazazzaro's lawyers did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.

business	Bank of England boosts plan to calm market turmoil	"Bank of England has announced new measures aimed at ensuring an ""orderly end"" to its emergency bond buying scheme which was introduced to stop a collapse of some pension funds. 
Bank will increase the amount of bonds it can buy in the final week of the scheme, which ends on Friday. 
It will also introduce extra support to ease future strains on pension funds. 
Bank initially stepped in after the government's mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets.
With the deadline for the Bank's bond-buying programme fast approaching, there have been concerns volatility would return once the scheme ends.
However, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the Bank was taking the approach of ""talking loudly and carrying a big stick"" in its attempt to calm concerns,
He said the measures are ""designed to reassure pension managers - and pension holders - that help will be provided"". 
He added that the Bank's announcement reaffirms that the bond purchases were a short-term measure and ""it remains committed to withdrawing monetary stimulus and tightening monetary policy as it fights inflation"".
mini-budget - which was announced on 23 September - pledged £45bn of tax cuts as part of a plan to boost economic growth, but the level of government borrowing required shocked investors who questioned the sustainability of the public finances.
In the aftermath of the statement, the pound hit a record low and investors demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to drop sharply in value.
Certain types of funds in the pension industry, which invest in bonds, were forced to start selling, sparking fears of a fresh market downturn.
On 28 September, the Bank stepped in to buy government bonds saying its decision was driven by concern over ""a material risk to UK financial stability"".
It said it would buy up to £65bn bonds, with a limit of £5bn a day.
So far, the Bank has bought only around £5bn bonds in total under the programme and in its latest announcement it said stood ready to increase the size of its daily purchases. On Monday, it doubled the limit to £10bn.
rvention is about a transition off the Bank of England emergency support offered in government bond markets, in the aftermath of the mini-budget.
Bank of England is trying to leave no stone unturned in making sure the withdrawal of this support occurs in an orderly manner. But the Bank is also committing to the timetable to phase out the support this week. Some in the markets had anticipated it would need to be extended.
Bank is demonstrating that this intervention is not intended to limit the rise in government costs, but instead was a temporary and targeted effort aimed at maintaining financial stability.
message heard in markets on Monday, with effective borrowing costs, or yields, on government debt on the rise again. These rates were over 4.5% for borrowing over 30 years and five years.
g picture is this: if the Treasury wants to bring down now rising government borrowing costs - which have an effect on mortgages and business lending too - it is up to it to present a credible set of tax and spending plans and independent forecasts, which are now promised for the end of October.
forecasts and the plan will now feed into the Bank of England's interest rate decision in early November.
Bank of England's intervention was a temporary bridge over a specific crisis. The solution here is for the government.
government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets.
But a collapse in the price of those bonds in the aftermath of the mini-budget was forcing some funds to rush to sell bonds further forcing down the price.
If that process had continued, there was a risk that those pension funds could have got to a position where they could not pay their debts.
In its latest statement, the Bank said there had been ""substantial progress"" in addressing the financial problems facing these funds, which had faced the prospect of having to make forced sales of £50bn of bonds.
As well as increasing the daily limit on bond purchases this week, the Bank also announced a further measure to help the funds affected by the recent market volatility.
Under the measure, these funds will be able to use a wider range of assets - such as company bonds - to access money to help meet any short-term financial demands.
It is hoped this means these funds will not be forced to sell government bonds to raise cash, which was what they had to do in the immediate aftermath of the mini-budget.
measure will continue after the emergency bond-buying programme has finished.
Before the mini-budget, the yield on government borrowing over a 30-year period stood at about 3.7%. The yield is effectively the interest rate.
After the mini-budget it jumped to 5.1% until the Bank's intervention pushed the rate back down. However, in recent days it has crept back up again to around 4.5%."	/news/business-63198341
business	Pound sinks as UK economic uncertainty rises	"und fell against the dollar on Friday as new figures showed a gloomy picture for the UK economy.
Sterling slipped to $1.11, after rallying on Thursday as Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned.
However, it clawed back losses on Friday evening and was back up to around $1.12 against the dollar.
und came after official figures showed government borrowing rose to its second highest September on record.
Meanwhile, people are shopping less than they did before the coronavirus pandemic, according to figures from the Office For National Statistics (ONS).
Retail sales fell by more than expected last month, dropping 1.4% and continuing their slide from August, the official figures showed.
und's latest slide comes after a period of volatile trading for the currency.
It plunged to a record low against the dollar last month, while government borrowing costs rose sharply in the aftermath of the mini-budget. Investors were spooked after the government promised huge tax cuts without saying how it would pay for them.
Government borrowing costs also rose slightly on Friday.
A fall in the US dollar against a number of currencies late Friday helped the pound regain some ground.
But Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank, said much of the pound's moves are being driven by investors reacting to political and economic uncertainty in the UK as well as the negative economic data. 
""While sterling rallied yesterday on Truss's resignation, I think investors have realised today that it's not a guarantee that we'll get a market-friendly outcome from the Conservative leadership contest,"" she said.
Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt is due to announce plans for spending and tax on 31 October in his economic plan, which the Treasury confirmed was set to go ahead, although there are reports it could be delayed due to the leadership race.
Ms Foley said this uncertainty was also weighing on the pound.
""The longer the uncertainty continues, the worse it's going to be for the markets.""
A fall in the value of the pound increases the price of goods and services imported into the UK from overseas - because when the pound is weak against the dollar or euro, for example, it costs more for companies in the UK to buy things such as food, raw materials or parts from abroad.
A weaker pound can push rising costs higher as well if companies choose to pass on higher prices to customers. For people planning a trip overseas, changes in the pound affect how far their money will go abroad.
""Consumers are now buying less than before the pandemic,"" said Darren Morgan, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which released the figures, said.
He added: ""Retailers told us that the fall in September was partly because many stores were closed for the Queen's funeral, but also because of continued price pressures leading consumers to be careful about spending.""
f living crisis continues to squeeze household budgets, with prices rising faster than average wages.
Inflation - the rate at which UK prices rise - surged to 10.1% last month and is expected to climb further.
Mr Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said all types of shops saw sales drop with food stores particularly hard hit.
UK is borrowing billions of pounds to limit energy bill rises for households and businesses.
Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was £20bn last month, up £2.2bn from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
It is the second highest September borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, the ONS said.
figure is lower than in September 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, when the government was borrowing to fund schemes such as furlough, it said.
But economists warned that government borrowing is set to rise further in the coming months.
Office For Budget Responsibility (OBR) makes independent forecasts on what impact government decisions on things like tax and spending will have on borrowing and growth.
It is due to issue its latest forecast on 31 October when the chancellor is due to deliver his economic plan detailing its spending plans.
Carl Emmerson, Deputy Director of think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said so far for the first half of the year government borrowing was almost as expected but warned it was likely to rise much higher.
""But this is little guide to how much borrowing will be over the whole of this financial year, as the huge cost of government support for household and business energy use only began in earnest this month.""
IFS predicts borrowing this year could reach almost £200bn, ""nearly £100bn more than the OBR forecast,"" he added.
Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK, also warned that government borrowing was expected to ""only worsen from October onwards"".

business	Boris Johnson signals controls on steel imports to stay	"rime minister has signalled controls on steel imports that were due to expire this week could be retained.
When asked whether this could lead to a possible breach of international law, Boris Johnson responded ""these are tough choices we have to make"". 
It follows a proposed approach set out by the international trade secretary on Thursday.
But the Department for International Trade said a final decision has not yet been made. 
Speaking at the G7 summit in Germany, Mr Johnson said keeping the import controls on foreign steel would protect British producers which are already under pressure from rising energy prices.
""We need British steel to be provided with much cheaper energy,"" Mr Johnson said. 
""But until we can fix that, I think it is reasonable for UK steel to have the same protections that absolutely every other European steel economy does.""
Earlier this month, Mr Johnson linked the resignation of his ethics adviser Lord Geidt to a disagreement about future decisions on steel tariffs. 
But Mr Geidt said that interpretation of his decision to quit didn't reflect ""the far wider scope of my objection"". 
mits on steel imports being considered were first introduced by the European Union in 2018 in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The controls were mirrored by the UK after Brexit. 
restrictions, which add a tariff to steel imports once a certain quota has been reached, are known as ""steel safeguards"" because they are designed to protect the domestic market from surges of cheap steel from overseas. 
rols are currently in place for 15 categories of steel. While controls protecting 10 of those categories have already been extended to 2024, import limits on five categories are set to expire on 30 June.
question of extending tariffs on steel imports is seen as potentially breaking World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments.
Asked whether the government was considering imposing tariffs which may be illegal, cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said the government was focused on ""ensuring we work within international law.""
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, the Northern Ireland Secretary said he was ""not saying the government is going to do this"" but that ""this is something that is supported across the sector"" and the government has ""got to look at all these things"" and ""get the balance right."" 
UK Steel, the lobby group for the British steel industry, said it was confident extending the steel controls would be ""WTO compliant"" and ""there would be no legitimate reason for challenges"".  
Department for International Trade said it is consulting with foreign counterparts in adherence with World Trade Organization rules, before making a final decision on whether to extend the safeguards.
UK Steel said ending the import controls would expose British steelmakers to a distorted global marketplace and that could cause as much as £150m a year in damage. 
Also speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said Labour would support the prime minister in the tariffs being continued.
""It's an extension that both the EU and the Americans have continued with so we would support him,"" he said. 
""Steel workers support him, the unions support him, industry supports him and Labour does support him.""
But the Conservative MP and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat tweeted today: ""Protectionism is destructive to all of us. Tariffs are un-Conservative because they're a tax on consumers."" "	/news/business-61944665

It is the most a piece of sporting memorabilia worn during play has fetched in history. 
Auction house Sotheby's says it drew ""palpable excitement"" from collectors.
It was reminiscent of a sporting season - chronicled in Netflix documentary The Last Dance - which saw Jordan winning his sixth and final NBA title.
On Thursday, Sotheby's said Jordan's Chicago Bulls jersey attracted a total of 20 bids.
Sotheby's head of streetwear and modern collectables, Brahm Wachter, said bidders were ""eager to own a rarefied piece of history"".
""Today's record-breaking result... solidifies Michael Jordan as the undisputed G.O.A.T, proving his name and incomparable legacy is just as relevant as it was nearly 25 years ago,"" Wachter said. G.O.A.T is an acronym for ""greatest of all time"".

It was auctioned with a June 1998 Sports Illustrated magazine, which features Jordan on the cover.
Jordan is seen by many as the best player in the history of basketball. He spent most of his career with the Chicago Bulls, became a global icon and helped raise the NBA's profile around the world.
Although the Chicago Bulls lost the opening game of the NBA Finals against Utah Jazz, it won the next three games. Then Utah Jazz took the next game by two points.
In the sixth game, Jordan put the Bulls up 87-86 with just 5.2 seconds left on the clock, and secured his final NBA title.
meback was cheered by basketball fans around the world.
Jordan had abruptly retired from basketball in October 1993, following the murder of his father in North Carolina. The star had won seven scoring titles and led the Chicago Bulls to three straight championships.
""I have always stressed... that when I lose the sense of motivation and the sense to prove something as a basketball player, it's time to leave,"" Jordan said.

business	Co-op launches trial to cut back use of lighting	"Co-op is trialling reduced lighting in stores as a way of saving money as energy bills continue to soar. 
upermarket is rolling out dimmer lighting in around 500 of its 2,500 convenience stores across the UK. 
It is understood the cost saving measures could reduce electricity bills by up to £4,000 a year for a single store.
It follows supermarket chains such as Sainsbury's and Morrisons making similar moves.
Co-op could potentially cut its energy bills by as much as £10m if similar savings were made across all of its stores. 
A spokesman for the company said it was trialling the initiative to reduce its environmental impact and help cut costs in the long run.
mpany is reviewing how it can become a ""more energy efficient business, without compromising safety and still achieving a positive store environment and shopping experience"" for customers, the spokesman said. 
Co-op is not the first retailer to cut back on the use of lighting in stores.  
Sainsbury's lowers lighting when it is bright outside or during less busy hours. 
rt of its long-running environmental plans to save energy and meet its goal of being net zero in its operations by 2035. 
Last year, it finished the roll out of LED lighting right across its supermarkets to cut energy consumption. 
It also uses a system that automatically monitors and controls lighting in stores to ensure that its sites are only lit when required. 
Morrisons also dims the lights for the first and last hour of trade in most of its stores, as well as its ""quiet hour"" on a Saturday. The supermarket has done this since the coronavirus pandemic and it helps to reduce its energy bill.
UK faces ""a significant risk"" of gas shortages this winter, industry regulator Ofgem said last week, which could have an effect on electricity supplies.
Energy costs, which were already rising, have soared as the conflict in Ukraine reduces the availability of Russian gas.
Prices have also risen because demand for energy has rocketed since Covid restrictions ended.
National Grid has also announced it will launch a scheme from 1 November which incentivises businesses and households to reduce their electricity use at key times to help reduce pressure on the energy supply this winter. 
mpany said larger businesses will be paid for reducing demand, for example by shifting their times of energy use or switching to batteries or generators in peak times."	/news/business-63214968
business	Credit Suisse cuts 9,000 jobs to stem losses	"Banking giant Credit Suisse is cutting thousands of jobs and restructuring its business in an attempt to stem heavy losses and investor concerns. 
After scandals in recent years and a SF4bn ($4bn, £3.5bn) loss in the most recent quarter, the bank said it was taking ""a series of decisive actions"".
It said 9,000 posts would go over the next three years but did not say where the cuts would fall.
Chairman Axel Lehmann dubbed the overhaul a ""blueprint for success"".
But investors did not respond positively, with Credit Suisse shares down more than 13% following the announcement.
As part of the restructuring plan Credit Suisse aims to raise $4bn in new capital, $1.5bn of which will come from Saudi National Bank.
It plans to spin off the bank's investment arm, relaunching the CS First Boston brand, and wind down some of its higher-risk businesses. 
workforce will fall from 52,000 now to 43,000 by the end of 2025, with 2,700 jobs going before the end of this year. Credit Suisse is based in Switzerland, but has a major hub in London and employs 5,500 people in the UK.
will help it shrink its overall cost base by SFr2.5bn or 15% by 2025, it said. 
It is also setting up a ""bad bank"" unit to house high-risk assets that it wants to wind down.
rd attempt in recent years to turn around the embattled group after a series of scandals hit the bank, once considered a stalwart of Swiss respectability.
In February 2020, its then chief executive Tidjane Thiam left after a scandal around covert surveillance operations. In March that year the Archegos investment fund imploded saddling Credit Suisse with huge losses and it was also dealt a blow by the collapse of the British finance company Greensill Capital.
Last year, the bank's chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio resigned after less than nine months for breaching Covid rules. Later the bank was fined for a corruption scandal involving Mozambique's tuna fishing industry. 
r the bank was fined over a money-laundering scandal related to a Bulgarian drugs ring, replaced its chief executive, and last month found its shares under pressure from investors concerned about the firm's financial health. Its share price has halved since January.
Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second largest bank, said the restructuring would create ""a simpler, more focused and more stable bank"".
Ulrich Koerner, who took over as chief executive in July said the bank's performance this year had been affected by ""continued challenging market and macroeconomic conditions"".
""This is a historic moment for Credit Suisse. We are radically restructuring the investment bank to help create a new bank that is simpler, more stable and with a more focused business model built around client needs,"" he said.
JPMorgan analysts said that ""question marks remain"" over the restructuring, adding that the share sale to raise new money would weigh on the stock price.
Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Swiss investment managers Vontobel, said the plan was ""just the first step in a lengthy process to restore credibility and regain the trust"" of stakeholders.
""Resolute execution and no further mis-steps will be key and it will take time until results will begin to show,"" he said."	/news/business-63411081

business	Lloyds Bank staff to get £1,000 to help with cost of living	"More than 64,000 staff at Lloyds Bank are to receive a £1,000 one-off payment to help with the rising cost of living in the UK.
ment - due to be made in August - comes after a campaign by the union Unite, which demonstrated at Lloyds' annual general meeting last month.
Unite said it was a ""important step"" in changing the bank's pay structures.
In a memo seen by the BBC, Lloyds said the money would help during uncertain economic times.
Prices in the UK are surging at their fastest rate for 40 years due to record-high fuel and energy costs, putting pressure on households' finances.
Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - currently stands at 9%, and is expected to increase further later this year.
""Unite members' collective action has put desperately needed money into the pockets of staff on the front line,"" said Sharon Graham, Unite's general secretary.
""Staff will welcome the £1,000 bonus but there is still a long way to go to eradicate low pay in one of the economy's most profitable sectors.""
Unite has been campaigning to get businesses to pay staff more, amid the cost of living crisis. 
""There is anger that this wealthy organisation is forcing some bank employees to turn to debt to pay their bills,"" Unite said about Lloyds in May, when it said some staff had told the union they could not afford to heat their homes or make pension payments.
In its memo, Lloyds Bank said that it anticipated the current economic environment would continue featuring in pay negotiations with its employees in 2023.
Last month, official figures showed that there were fewer unemployed people than job vacancies for the first time since records began.
Pay rates have been increasing as businesses have been seeking to recruit and retain staff.
Last week, Morrisons announced it was increasing wages for 80,000 of its workers. Rival supermarket chains Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda have already announced pay rises this year."	/news/business-61781313

ft to online shopping during the pandemic had ""increased the imperative"" to reduce its clothing and home trading space. 
Many town centres had ""lost impetus"" due to ""failed local authority or government policy"", M&S said. 
It said it was now relocating some shops from older, multi-floor buildings with poor access and parking. 
""As a result, a high proportion, but not all, of our relocations are to the edge of town,"" the retail giant said. 
M&S said it was planning around 15 new full-line stores and 40 new food stores over the next three years. 
mpany said it was investing in a number of stores which had been relocated to the edges of towns, including to former Debenhams sites in Leamington Spa and Thurrock. 
It is part of a long-term plan to overhaul its large stores. The shake-up will eventually see the closure of some 110 main stores as it focuses on fewer but better locations.  
A total of 68 of these main-line stores have already shut and the retailer confirmed another 32 will go over the next three years. 
Boss Steve Rowe told reporters M&S was ""moving with the customer, where the customer is working and shopping"". 
He said the chain had ""some fabulous city and town centre stores"" but it had to ensure its portfolio was ""balanced"" and there would be more of a bias towards food in the future. 
Announcing its results for last year, M&S, which is turning its business around after years of decline, said it had seen strong performance in its clothing and home operation. 
was driven by a 55.6% surge in online sales. However, in-store sales fell by 11.2%. 
Meanwhile, its food sales were up by 10.1%. 
Overall, the company reported pre-tax profits of £392m for the year to 2 April - up from a loss of £209m the previous year.
However, M&S said it expected sales growth to slow due to rising costs and increased pressure on customer budgets. 
mpany said it was facing increased food costs, driven by global supply issues and labour shortages, while factory, transport and freight costs, as well as continued supply issues in China, were putting pressure on its clothing and home business. 
Julie Palmer, a retail expert at Begbies Traynor, said the typical M&S customer tended to be wealthier and less hard hit by rising costs ""but they could still choose to economise"" .
""How long cash-strapped shoppers will feel comfortable splashing out on M&S's upmarket foods remains to be seen,"" she added.
Household budgets are being squeezed by rising food, energy and fuel bills, with inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hitting 9% in April - the highest level for 40 years.
Also on Wednesday, online grocer Ocado warned that its joint venture with M&S will see earnings and sales weighed down by growing pressure on customers' spending.
Ocado Retail, an online retail business which is owned 50-50 by the two companies, said consumers are ordering ""one or two fewer items per shop"" against the backdrop of a growing cost of living crisis.
Chief executive Steve Rowe is handing over the reins today after 40 years at M&S, starting as a Saturday boy in Croydon. 
usiness is certainly in better shape now than when he started the top job in 2016.

business	Energy bills could break firms, warns ex-chancellor	"Soaring energy bills could be the ""straw that finally breaks the camel's back"" for small businesses, former chancellor Alistair Darling has warned.
Mr Darling, who was Labour chancellor during the financial crisis, said ""bold action"" was needed to help the economy.
rgy price cap for households will soar by 80% from October.
But firms are not covered by the cap and Mr Darling said that after surviving Covid, energy costs risked finishing them off.   
Mr Darling described the current situation as a ""lethal cocktail"" and said it required ""bold action"" to be taken by the government.
Both candidates in the Conservative Party leadership race, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have come under pressure to outline further support for households and firms following the announcement that energy bills would rise again this Autumn. 
w leader - and prime minster to succeed Boris Johnson - will be announced next Monday.
Ms Truss has so far confirmed she will cut National Insurance and green levies on bills. Mr Sunak has proposed tax cuts on energy bills as part of a £10bn package.
It emerged at the weekend that Ms Truss is considering a ""nuclear"" option of cutting VAT by 5% as well as raising the threshold at which people start paying tax. 
In May, the government announced £37bn worth of help for households with the rising cost of living. 
But Mr Darling told the BBC's Today programme the government needed to announce more support.
""You've got to announce it now,"" he said. 
""Frankly the stuff that's been announced so far might have passed muster earlier this year, it simply won't do now, you need something far more substantial.""
Mr Darling said many firms, ""especially the smaller ones who have been struggling through the whole Covid problems over the last couple of years may find that [the cost of energy] is the straw that finally breaks the camel's back"".
He said: ""My fear is if the government doesn't do something, you will not just have hardship for individuals and businesses, but you will find that people's spending goes down.
""And the risk is, at the moment people are saying the chances of us going into recession are 50-50. It could just tip us into recession, which of course would be disastrous for us.""
He added: ""One lesson I drew from what happened in 2008 is you've got to do more than people expect, and you've got to it more quickly than people expect, if it's going to work.""
A spokesperson for the Treasury said it was ""making the necessary preparations to ensure a new government has options to deliver additional support as quickly as possible, as the chancellor has made clear"".
""And as the prime minister has made clear, no major fiscal decisions will be taken until the new prime minister is in post,"" they added.
On Friday, energy regulator Ofgem announced a rise in the energy price cap. It means a typical household will pay £3,549 a year for gas and electricity starting in October up from £1,971 currently. And some economists have warned that could rise even further. 
Wholesale gas prices have been rising since last year but have worsened recently because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin's decision to squeeze energy supplies to Europe. 
Small businesses across a number of industries have voiced their concerns over rising energy bills.
More than 750 restaurant and café owners called on the government and Conservative leadership candidates for support through VAT cuts, grants and business rate rebates.
In an open letter, the signatories said takeaways were being quoted ""eyewatering bills"" that were ""simply impossible to pay"".
""The government has waited until the last moment to act before, but now cannot be one of those times. 
""It must work with the Conservative leadership candidates on a plan to support Britain's smallest restaurants before it's too late,"" said Ibrahim Dogus, chair of the British Takeaway Campaign.
Jon Long, who runs five fish and chips shops in Dorset, told the BBC if he had to pay the current market rate for gas and electricity, it would mean the end his business after four generations in his family.
He managed to fix his gas and electric rates with his energy provider in 2021 and secured a two-year contract, but many businesses aren't in his position.
""What seemed to be extortionate then now seems like an absolute steal,"" he said. 
59-year-old said currently his average bill per shop is about £15,000 per year, but based on current wholesale prices, it would cost him up to £80,000. 
""We are on a war footing here. There has been a lot of talk, a lot of sympathy, they (the government) have been listening but no action,"" he said.
""Businesses coming out of contracts need drastic help, and they need it now or we face losing thousands of previously viable businesses.""
Bank of England recently warned that the UK economy will fall into recession later this year as rising energy costs push up the rate of inflation. It recently raised interest rates by 0.5% - the biggest increase in 27 years - in an attempt to cool rising consumer prices which hit 10.1% in July.
Mr Darling said the financial crisis more than a decade ago was different to today's economic climate, but warned the current situation was ""just as threatening to people, [and] to the economy as the financial crisis was back in 2008"".
""It's not just people on low incomes who are going to be affected by this, it's going to be people right up the income chain,"" he said."	/news/business-62712188
business	Energy bills to be cut by hundreds as part of support package worth billions	"Households in England, Scotland and Wales are set to have hundreds of pounds knocked off energy bills as part of a package worth billions to help people cope with soaring prices.
government is to scrap a plan to give people £200 off bills from October which would be repaid over five years.
Instead, the BBC understands that sum will be increased and possibly doubled, and will not need to be paid back.
Additional help for those on the lowest incomes is also expected.
upport, to be announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak later, is expected to be largely funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas firms that could raise £7bn.
It comes a day after Sue Gray's critical report into lockdown parties in Downing Street and follows intense pressure on the government to do more to help people with the cost of living crisis.  
Earlier this week the UK's energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household energy bill was set to rise by £800 in October, bringing the typical household bill to £2,800 a year. Bills had already risen on average by £700 in April.
Ofgem warned it meant 12 million households could be placed into fuel poverty.
Most people living in homes in England in council tax bands A-D have already received a £150 rebate on their bills. 
Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the ""bulk"" of government support needed to go to those on the lowest incomes ""who are suffering the most severe consequences of this cost of living crisis"".
She told the BBC the charity was now helping more than 750 people every day with food bank vouchers. 
""We have got people in this country who cannot put food on the table, they cannot keep their lights on and the heating on,"" she said. 
Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said offering a universal payment would mean a lot of the money would go to households who ""don't desperately need it"". 
He also warned putting billions of pounds into the economy at a time when prices were rising quickly ""could stoke additional demand and make inflation much more permanent"". 
Opposition parties have repeatedly called for a windfall tax on energy companies that have made bumper profits, in large part because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
But until now the government had resisted calls to impose the one-off levy, with some senior members of the cabinet arguing it could deter energy firms from investing in the UK. 
However, it is understood the prime minister has now sided with Mr Sunak, who had been pushing for the tax.
But proposals to tax income from other electricity producers, such as some older windfarms and nuclear plants which have also seen windfall gains, have been shelved. 
And companies that increase investment in the UK could earn a discount on the additional tax.
reasury said the government understood ""that people are struggling with rising prices"" and that Mr Sunak had been ""clear that as the situation evolves, so will our response"".
David Thompson is one of those struggling to pay the bills. The 46-year-old has five children and four grandchildren and gets Universal Credit - which he calls ""Universal Crisis"".
""It is getting worse and worse, but you have just got to make do with what you have got. It is a struggle. You are worrying before you get paid, then when you get paid you worry how far it is going to go,"" he said,
""It is supposed to last a month, but you are skint after a week or two.""
As typical household energy bills are rising, and are set to go up again in October, he said that any extra support given by the government was never going to match the rate of price rises at the moment.
""This is one of the worst times. I remember when the shipyards went down, and the miners' strikes. People are more well-off now than the 80s and the 90s, but things are a lot more expensive,"" he said.
Energy firms have made huge profits following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Shell reported a record £7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made £5bn, the highest for 10 years.
But Offshore Energies UK, which represents the offshore oil and gas industry, said a windfall tax on energy firms would see higher prices and do long-term damage to the oil and gas industry.
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of the body, said: ""This is an industry that thinks and plans long-term, so sudden new costs, like this proposed tax, will disrupt planning and investment and, above all, undermine investor confidence.""
Higher energy bills are pushing prices to rise at the fastest rate for 40 years, with fuel and food costs also biting into household budgets.
Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said conditions in the global gas market had worsened after Russia's invasion and warned that the price cap could rise beyond £2,800 if Moscow decided to disrupt supplies.
Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact.
While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption - as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia - it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased. "	/news/business-61584546
business	Inflation drives fastest fall in real pay on record	"Pay has fallen further behind the rising cost of living, according to the latest official data.
While average wages rose 4.7% between April and June, that was outpaced by inflation - or price rises - which is growing at a much faster pace. 
As a result, the ""real value"" of pay fell by 3%, according to the Office for National Statistics.
Household budgets are being hit by soaring energy bills as well as higher food and fuel costs.
rise in prices has fuelled the UK inflation rate to a 40-year high. The latest inflation figure, due out on Wednesday, is forecast to be higher.
gap between pay growth and inflation is the biggest since records began more than 20 years ago.
Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS said the ""real value"" of pay was continuing to fall. ""Excluding bonuses, it is still dropping faster than at any time since comparable records began in 2001,"" he said.
ghlighted a gap between public and private sector wage growth.
Private sector wages grew by 5.9% while those working in the public sector saw pay growth of 1.8% - which Mr Morgan said is the ""largest difference we have seen for 20 years"".
rising cost of living has prompted calls from workers and unions for pay rises, with some sectors, such as the rail industry, taking strike action in recent weeks. 
More than 40,000 railway workers, who are members of the RMT union, are set to go on strike this Thursday and Saturday, but disruption is also expected on Friday because normal services may take time to resume.
Last month,  the government announced pay rises for millions of public sector workers including teachers, nurses, doctors, police officers, and members of the armed forces.
However, most wage increases awarded were below the current rate of inflation of 9.4%, with ministers arguing large rises could cause inflation to remain higher for longer. 
Bank of England recently lifted interest rates by the largest amount in 27 years to 1.75% in a bid to cool rising prices. It also warned that the UK economy will fall into recession towards the end of this year as prices for gas and electricity continue to rise.
Nye Cominetti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said Britain was witnessing the biggest pay squeeze since the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977.
""The scale of this pay pain is even deeper than official figures suggest too, as pay growth estimates are still artificially boosted by the effects of the furlough scheme last year,"" he said.
It says something about the extremity of inflation that the average pay rise is still not enough to keep up with price rises. 
key now will be what happens to inflation next year. If price inflation slows down as hoped, then pay rises may once more outstrip price rises. That's better for workers' living standards. 
But the Bank of England will be worried that it means higher pay will itself become a cost fuelling inflation and that pay will have to rise by even more to make up for that - the much-dreaded 'wage-price-spiral' so that inflation takes a lot longer to get back to the 2% target.
Expect an interest rate rise in September, and it might be more than a quarter of a percentage point. 
Julie Marson, minister at the Department for Work and Pensions, said the government recognised people were ""struggling with rising prices"".
""Being in stable employment is one of the best ways for people to get on, but we're also providing £1,200 direct payments for millions of low income households as part of our £37bn package of support to help with the cost of living,"" she said.
Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the fall in real wages was ""further proof that the Tories have lost control of the economy"".
""Because of the Tories' failure on the economy, families face plummeting real wages and soaring energy bills. Yet, this Zombie Government is offering no solutions to the cost of living crisis,"" he said.
Separately, the ONS also revealed that quarterly job vacancies fell for the first time since 2020. Between May and July, they dropped by 19,800 to 1.274 million.
ugh the ONS points out that since vacancies fell to an all-time low between April to June 2020 in the beginning months of the Covid pandemic, they have increased by 945,000. 
Overall, the ONS said the unemployment rate held at 3.8%, while the employment rate for people aged 16 to 64 decreased slightly to 75.5%.
umber of people classed as economic inactive, not in or seeking for work, was unchanged between April to June at 21.4%. The over-50s make up the majority of people who have left work since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak.
Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, said the ""overall picture"" in the jobs market was "" still positive for those looking for work or to change jobs to raise their pay"".
But he said firms were still struggling with staff shortages, which he claimed would ""constrain growth and drive inflation"".
Louise Juggins, who runs the Crow Bar in Felixstowe, is one of many business owners struggling to recruit staff, which she said had affected her summer trade.
""We could certainly be taking more than we are if we were doing food seven days a week and I'd got more staff so we could put the facilities out there,"" she said.
""We're not putting tables out on Mondays and Tuesdays at the moment purely because I haven't got the staff to do so"". 
While Trevor Mangan who runs TJ Painting and Decorating in Alton, said: ""It's an absolute nightmare trying to find decent people, there's so much work around so people don't want to spend the time learning the trade.

business	Decision on energy bill support for businesses postponed	"A decision on extending help for businesses facing soaring energy bills will not be made until the new year, the Treasury has said.
Currently wholesale gas and electricity prices have been fixed for firms from October until March 2023, but the help is under review due to the cost.
Ministers had promised to make an announcement before the end of 2022, and the delay angered business groups.
was creating uncertainty for firms worried about their bills.
""Disappointing news that government has also postponed announcement on future energy support until the New Year rather than before Christmas as previously announced,"" tweeted Kate Nicholls, boss of UK Hospitality, which represents hotels, restaurants and others in the industry.
""Businesses are facing daily changing rates and contract decisions in Jan so certainty was really needed."" 
Unlike households, businesses are not covered in normal times by an energy price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge per unit of energy. 
But after energy prices spiked this year, the government's Energy Bill Relief Scheme fixed costs, providing a lifeline for many firms that risked going bust without the support. 
In October the government said it would review the scheme due to its high cost to taxpayers and publish those findings by the end of this year. Officials are considering options to extend support only for ""vulnerable businesses"". 
On Monday, the Treasury said its final decision would now not be announced until the start of 2023.
""We are protecting businesses from high energy costs this winter, caused by Putin's invasion of Ukraine, through the six-month £18bn Energy Bill Relief Scheme,"" a spokesperson said.
""However, this is very expensive, and we need to ensure longer-term affordability and value for money for the taxpayer.
""That is why we are currently carrying out a review with the aim of reducing the public finances' exposure to volatile international energy prices from April 2023. We will announce the outcome of this review in the New Year to ensure businesses have sufficient certainty about future support before the current scheme ends in March 2023.""
Business groups have been calling for the government to provide certainty to businesses on energy support. 
On Monday, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) urged the government to make an announcement before Christmas, saying many of its members would struggle to pay their energy bills when the scheme comes to an end.

business	Russian McDonald's buyer to rebrand restaurants	"Watch: Moscow residents react to McDonald's leaving Russia after 30 years
McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, after the war in Ukraine pushed it to quit the country.
Alexander Govor, who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia, will take on the firm's restaurants and staff, operating them under a new brand, the fast food giant said.
It did not disclose the sale price, but has warned investors it would take a more than $1bn hit from the exit.
McDonald's had operated in Russia for more than 30 years.
g of its first restaurant in Moscow in 1990 came to symbolise a thaw in Cold War tensions. 
A year later, the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia opened up its economy to companies from the West. More than three decades later, however, it is one of a growing number of corporations pulling out as the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions make it difficult to operate.
McDonald's, which had nearly 850 restaurants in the country, most of them directly owned, said it expected the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, to close in coming weeks.
Mr Govor has been a licensee of McDonald's since 2015. He is also co-founder of Neftekhimservice, a refining company, and a board member of another firm that owns the Park Inn hotel and private clinics in Siberia.
Russia's Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said the deal was the result of a ""long and difficult"" negotiation process and the government would provide Mr Govor with all the necessary assistance to set up operations.
rms provide for McDonald's 62,000 staff in Russia to be retained for at least two years, with their existing pay and Mr Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff in Russia until the deal is completed.
McDonald's will retain its trademark in the country, it said, while the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding.
Announcing plans for the sale earlier this week, chief executive Chris Kempczinski called the decision ""extremely difficult"".
""However, we have a commitment to our global community and must remain steadfast in our values. And our commitment to our values means that we can no longer keep the arches shining there,"" he said.
McDonald's suspended operations at the restaurants it owned in Russia in March, citing the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the Ukraine war.
move drew outrage among Russian politicians and prompted threats the business would be seized. 
A patent application for an ""Uncle Vanya"" restaurant chain was filed with Russian authorities shortly after. The name, the same as the famous work by Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, was one of several brand knock-offs of Western companies to surface.
Last year, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 9% of McDonald's revenue.
move by McDonald's came after French carmaker Renault sold its majority stake in carmaker Aftovaz to a state research institute for a symbolic sum, while its Renault Russia business was taken over by the city of Moscow. Manufacturing at the Renault plant is expected to resume under a Soviet-era brand."	/news/business-61512255
business	Elon Musk denies affair with Google co-founder Sergey Brin's wife	"Elon Musk has denied having an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder, Sergey Brin.
Mr Musk's comments came after the Wall Street Journal reported that his friendship with Mr Brin had ended over the alleged affair.
Replying to a link to the story posted on Twitter, Mr Musk referred to the report as ""total bs"".
Mr Musk went on to say that he is still friends with Mr Brin and that they were ""at a party together last night!""
Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal said that Mr Musk was engaged in a brief affair late last year with Ms Shanahan.
rompted Mr Brin to file for divorce earlier this year and ended the long friendship between the two high-profile technology billionaires, the paper also said.
But Mr Musk tweeted ""I've only seen Nicole twice in three years, both times with many other people around. Nothing romantic"".
At the time of the alleged affair in December, Mr Brin and his wife were separated but still living together, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a person close to Ms Shanahan.
In a separate tweet, Mr Musk said ""WSJ [Wall Street Journal] has run so many bs hit pieces on me and Tesla I've lost count.""
Even though they have a prenuptial agreement, Mr Brin and Ms Shanahan are currently negotiating a divorce settlement, which could be as much as $1bn (£830m), the paper said.
Ms Shanahan is a California-based attorney and founder of legal technology company ClearAccessIP and the Bia-Echo Foundation, according to her LinkedIn profile.
Bia-Echo Foundation is a philanthropic organisation that promotes ""reproductive longevity & equality, criminal justice reform and a healthy & livable planet"".
Mr Musk, who is also the boss of rocket firm SpaceX, is well known for how he operates his many companies but he has also attracted press interest in his private life. 
In tweets earlier this month he appeared to confirm reports he had twins in late 2021 with Shivon Zilis - an executive at his technology company Neuralink.
It came weeks after it was revealed his daughter Vivian had taken steps to cut ties with him, declaring her wish to no longer ""be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form"".
Mr Musk is currently embroiled in a legal fight over his abandoned plan to buy Twitter for $44bn.
Earlier this month, the social media platform sued him after he announced he was walking away from his proposed takeover of the firm.
Mr Musk is the world's richest person, with an estimated fortune of more $240bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
According to the same index, Mr Brin is worth around $95bn, making him the eighth richest person in the world.
Ms Shanahan, Mr Brin and Google did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.

business	Star casino: Record fine for Australian operator over money laundering	"Australian gambling giant Star Entertainment Group has been fined A$100m ($62m, £55m) for failing to stop money laundering at its Sydney casino.
group's licence to operate the casino has also been suspended.
Star has promised to ""do everything in [its] power"" to regain its licence and the community's trust.
Casino operators in Australia have been under great pressure to reform their gambling operations following reports of widespread criminal activity.
record penalties were announced in response to a damning inquiry in New South Wales (NSW) earlier this year.
It heard the Star had allowed money laundering and organised crime to infiltrate their Sydney casino, taking a ""cavalier"" approach to governance and at times making deliberate moves to cover its tracks.
At the time, the regulatory chief Philip Crawford said: ""The institutional arrogance of this company has been breathtaking.""
fine announced on Monday is the maximum allowed, but the NSW Independent Casino Commission stopped short of removing Star's licence altogether, to protect thousands of jobs.
Under the conditions of the suspension, the casino will still operate under a manager appointed by the regulator.
From Friday the Star will not be able to run the casino on its own until it can ""earn"" its licence back, Mr Crawford said.
A spokesman for The Star said the company is committed ""to charting a path back to suitability"".
It has previously promised to increase security staff, improve surveillance, end high-risk international VIP trips known as ""junkets"" and implement leadership changes.

Mr Crawford said the company's ""cultural issues"" would take time to stamp out, but it had showed signs it could reform under Mr Cooke's leadership.
Star entered a trading halt on Monday morning, which is set to last until Wednesday.
After a similar inquiry in Queensland, The Star was earlier this month also found unsuitable to run its three casinos in that state.
Media investigations have aired allegations of misconduct at various casinos around Australia in recent years, including at those owned by the country's largest gaming and entertainment group - Crown Resorts. 
It was fined $80 million by Victorian gambling authorities earlier this year for its failures to stop criminal activity.

business	Ryanair will grow even faster in recession, boss says	"Ryanair will grow even faster in the event of an economic downturn in the UK, the company's boss has told the BBC. 
Michael O'Leary said people would still fly during a recession but they would choose low-fare airlines like Ryanair.
firm has announced what it described as its biggest ever winter schedule to and from the UK.
Mr O'Leary said the expansion was because competitors - such as British Airways - had cut their capacity.
He acknowledged a recession would be a worry ""for the sake of passengers"" and said high inflation was a risk.
However, he predicted Ryanair would ""grow very strongly this winter"". 
Bank of England has forecast the UK economy will fall into recession later this year. This happens when the economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row.
Mr O'Leary told the BBC: ""A deep recession in the UK or an energy crisis will certainly affect overall demand, but within that - as has happened in the last four or five recessions - you see people trading down from high-fare airlines like BA and Easyjet, to low-fare airlines like Ryanair.""  
He likened this to ""the same way many people have switched from shopping in Sainsbury's to Lidl and Aldi"", and insisted he was ""confident we'll grow even faster as a result of any recession here"".
He said that Ryanair would be able to keep fares lower than other airlines due to its fuel-hedging strategy - where an airline agrees to purchase oil in the future at a predetermined price. 
However he repeated comments he had recently made to the BBC that super-cheap €10 tickets would not be possible in the near future, with the soaring cost of fuel pushing up the airline's average fare from around €40 (£33.75) last year to roughly €50 over the next five years.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair still had not been able to provide Covid refunds to 200,000 passengers, out of a total of 30 million.
He insisted this was because they had booked through online travel agents, whom he accused of being ""pirates"", and that Ryanair could not contact such passengers because details such as email addresses were often incorrect.
Mr O'Leary said the problems with staff shortages at airports seen at the start of the summer appeared to have been resolved ""at every airport with the exception of Heathrow"".   
He has started referring to Britain's biggest airport - from where Ryanair does not operate - as ""Hopeless Heathrow"", after it introduced a cap on passenger numbers which has prompted cancellations and ticket sales limits. Heathrow says its cap has been successful in reducing on-the-day disruption for passengers.
British Airways has been severely affected by the cap, cutting around two dozen flights a day until it ends.
BA also said that to ensure it can cope over winter, it will be cutting 10,000 flights between late October and March.
When it comes to staff wages, Mr O'Leary said he wanted to give pay rises, and things were now moving beyond agreements to restore pay to pre-Covid levels, to discussions over pay increases.  
He could not give guarantees across the board now, citing uncertainties such as how well the market recovers this winter, and the situation with the war in Ukraine. But he said he was moving ""aggressively"" towards negotiating increases in pay.
Ryanair has faced battles with unions after it cut salaries during the pandemic but it has been less affected by staff shortages and cancellations than other airlines.
mpany has said this was because it kept staff on, albeit on reduced pay, and maintained training at the height of Covid restrictions. 
Mr O'Leary also urged the victor in the ongoing Conservative party leadership contest to scrap Air Passenger Duty - which is paid by airlines for every passenger who flies from the UK - and to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU when they became prime minister.
He said the lack of free movement under the current ""hard Brexit"" deal had caused staffing challenges in the UK economy, including in airports, and accused Boris Johnson's government of being ""economically illiterate"".
He previously told the BBC a more ""practical, common sense"" approach to post-Brexit policy was needed, to allow more workers from Europe to fill vacancies.
Mr O'Leary said he expected passenger growth in the next few years to be largely made possible by taking delivery of 51 new, more efficient Boeing aircraft - although he cast some doubt upon whether they would be delivered on time."	/news/business-62728621

An influx of thousands of visiting fans across the two-week road racing festival has seen local businesses benefit from increased trade.
Martin Brunnschweiler of Bushy's Brewery said the event's cancellation for two years had been a ""huge blow"".
It has been ""wonderful"" to see the ""massive"" event return, he added.
Ferry bookings from before the festival began on 29 May showed more than 30,000 people were expected to arrive.
In 2019 more than 46,000 people travelled to the island with the total spend across the fortnight at about £37.5m.
Andrew Clague of the Manx Fun Farm campsite in Onchan said he had found the first week of the 2022 event ""busier than ever"", with many repeat customers returning after the disruption caused by Covid.
wo years we missed was a loss as the festival made a ""big difference"" by helping with the reinvestment in facilities, he added.
Douglas hotelier Michael George said the TT had a ""huge impact financially"", which helped his business for the rest of the year.
Welbeck Hotel was one of the firms to receive Covid support payments from the government, which Mr George said ""enabled us to get ready for this TT and the future"".

Owner of the Wine Cellar on Peel Road, JJ Moore, said the last three years had been ""challenging in every aspect of business"", but the return of TT had been ""such a big thing"".

business	'We haven't had a single penny from the Post Office'	"Baljit Sethi cannot understand why it is taking so long for the Post Office to pay him compensation.
""It doesn't seem like they're interested in doing anything,"" he says.
He is one of thousands of sub-postmasters who lost everything, after the introduction of a faulty IT system made it appear as though money was going missing.
fficial inquiry into the scandal was looking into the compensation process for a third time on Thursday.
quiry heard from government, Post Office and legal representatives, after its chairman Sir Wyn Williams said in September he was ""disappointed with the apparent lack of substantial progress to date"".
Post Office, which administers the compensation schemes, said it recognised the ""importance of ensuring that postmasters receive timely and fair compensation for the failings associated with the Horizon IT system"" and pointed to the numbers of people who had already received payments.
government says ""significant progress"" has already been made on compensation and has announced details of an additional compensation scheme that will begin work next year.
But solicitors for sub-postmasters making claims say the process is too slow.
Mr Sethi agrees that three years after the High Court declared the Post Office's Horizon IT system was riddled with ""bugs, errors and defects"", it is high time that people like him are properly compensated.
""We haven't had a single penny,"" he says.
""We've sent them so many emails, and after four or five months they reply: 'Please have patience, Mr Sethi'.""
""I mean, how long can I have patience for?"" he says.
Over 20 years Mr Sethi and his wife ran two post offices near Romford in east London, investing in the businesses and working long hours.
He noticed the new IT system was causing shortfalls in the accounts at one of his two branches. He alerted the Post Office, but nothing was done. After ongoing erratic results from the Horizon accounting software, he lost his businesses, became bankrupt, and his reputation in the local community was destroyed. He ended up working as a low-paid night security guard, struggling to make ends meet.
Other sub-postmasters were prosecuted, some spent time in prison, or had to pay back tens of thousands of pounds that they were wrongly accused of stealing.
Some former sub-postmasters have suffered other financial consequences.
Stefan Fountain, 65, decided to sell up and leave after his Post Office accounts started to show shortfalls, but that left him in ""an awful situation financially"".
He was declared bankrupt, and ended up losing his home, and is now living in rented accommodation.
Mr Fountain still owed money to creditors, and he has been told that £20,000 of his damages will go to official receivers, leaving him with £4,000.
""I get quite angry and bitter when I think about it, as I've had to struggle all of my life due to the failings of the Horizon system, and yet still I am treated like this,"" he said.
A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We are sincerely sorry for the impact of the Horizon scandal on the lives of victims and their families.""
Post Office, which is state-owned, runs two compensation schemes. One, the Historical Shortfall Scheme (HSS), is for people like Mr Sethi, former postmasters who had to cover discrepancies in their businesses' accounts with their own funds, but who were not prosecuted.
A Post Office spokesperson said there had been over 2,300 eligible applications for the HSS.
""Over 70% of applications have accepted an offer and received payment; and 95% of applicants should receive an offer by the end of this year. The scheme has also been extended to anyone who wants to submit a late application,"" he said.
Post Office said if outstanding applications had not received an offer, it was ""usually in light of a case-specific complexity"".
A second scheme, the Overturned Historical Convictions (OHC) scheme, provides payments to those who were prosecuted. So far £11.3m has been paid in compensation to 77 of the 83 individuals whose convictions had been overturned, although much of that is in interim payments, and only two cases have been fully settled. 
Post Office said it was ""making good progress with many more claims"".
On Wednesday the government outlined the details of a third scheme, to be overseen by the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).
w scheme will compensate the 555 former sub-postmasters who brought the initial legal action, known as the Group Litigation Order (GLO), that culminated in 2019 with a settlement at the High Court, making clear for the first time the scale of the miscarriage of justice that had taken place.
555 sub-postmasters did receive a share of the £57m original settlement, but that was mostly absorbed by legal fees and for legal reasons the GLO group are not eligible for either of the two Post Office-run compensation schemes.
w scheme would ""ensure that these trailblazing postmasters, who did so much to uncover this injustice, receive the compensation they deserve"", Business Secretary Grant Shapps said.
But solicitors representing the former postmasters said their clients were ""justifiably frustrated"" at the delays to authorising settlements.
Hudgell Solicitors, in a submission ahead of Thursday's inquiry hearing, highlighted the low initial offers that some claimants were receiving, which were increased three-fold or more when challenged. The delays in the process put ""great pressure"" on claimants in financial hardship to accept the initial offer, the firm said.
Howe and Co accused BEIS of ""inertia"", only making fast progress with the new compensation scheme in the build-up to a hearing at the inquiry. The HSS scheme was ""exceptionally slow"" the firm said.
rtainly been Mr Sethi's experience.
He made his initial application in February 2020. Since then he has answered hundreds of questions, but still received no substantial response.
Mr Sethi's son Adeep is doing his best to help his parents to keep battling through what he says is a very opaque process.
""These people are in their 70s and 80s, they're sick and tired of fighting,"" he says. ""They don't want the spectre of the Post Office haunting them any further."""	/news/business-63889700
business	OEUK calls on government for rapid North Sea action	"Energy firms have called on the UK government to ""rapidly accelerate"" investment in the North Sea.
rade body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said urgent action was needed to reduce the UK's reliance on exports and vulnerability to global price shocks.
It urged ministers to announce the next round of oil and gas exploration licences as soon as possible.
OEUK also called for production approvals to be speeded up, as well as a rapid expansion of offshore wind.
In an economic report focusing on UK energy security, the organisation said there were energy reserves equivalent to 15 billion barrels of oil - enough to fuel the UK for 30 years.
But it warned that without ""rapid new investment"", the UK would have to import about 80% of its gas and 70% of its oil by 2030.
report comes as new Prime Minister Liz Truss is poised to announce a raft of measures to deal with soaring energy costs.
Speaking outside Downing Street on Tuesday, Ms Truss promised to ""deal hands on with the energy crisis caused by Putin's war"". 
She said she would ""take action this week to deal with energy bills and to secure our future energy supply"".
OEUK's economic report estimates that the annual industry and consumer spend on energy will triple if the current planned October price cap increase goes ahead.
It also called for the Scottish and UK administrations to align regulation, responding to concerns that carbon capture and storage projects in the North Sea may be hampered by conflicting marine planning issues for offshore wind farms.
rade organisation said the time taken to develop an offshore project and get it into production should be ""slashed"", in particular complaining about the average 10-year wait to get grid connections agreed.
OEUK's acting chief executive Mike Tholen said the report was a ""red alert for UK energy security"" as he urged the UK government to break its reliance on Russian oil.
He said: ""The UK's homes and businesses cannot yet do without these fuels, but Putin's war in Ukraine shows the risks of relying on other countries for energy. 
""Our North Sea reserves mean the UK can protect itself - provided we invest - as well as building the low-carbon systems for the future.""
Mr Tholen said expanding the supply of low carbon energy such as wind and hydrogen was needed, but the scale-up would take time. 
He added: ""UK gas will give us a bedrock of reliable energy through the transition and minimise reliance on imports.
""In practical terms we need the new government to rapidly announce the next round of oil and gas exploration licenses and speed up production approvals.""
Almost 10 months since COP26 put a severe chill through the offshore oil and gas industry, today's industry report feels very different.
Oil and Gas UK had changed its name to Offshore Energy UK, to show its enthusiasm for marine renewables alongside hydrocarbons.
But President Putin's invasion of Ukraine has pumped life and hope back into the drilling business in British waters.
rgument is not over whether oil and gas should be burned. It now has evidence of what happens when supply is disrupted by an unreliable trading partner many years before the economy is ready to replace it.  So the argument is about the reliability of where that energy is sourced.
A further argument is whether a lower domestic price should be charged for British-sourced energy. OEUK senior executives say its corporate members are talking to government about that, but also warned how difficult it would be to implement dual pricing.
re's a confidence returning to the industry, now that a new prime minister sounds fully up for embracing the case for energy security. The Tory leadership race was not notable for its concern about climate change, instead closing on a reported desire by Team Truss to issue up to 130 new drilling licences.
OEUK says some of these are projects that could be completed quickly. Others are areas of seabed where seismic surveys and exploratory drilling have yet to take place.
Six billion or so barrels of oil, or its gas equivalent, has been found. Of the claim that there are 15 billion barrels yet to be extracted,  most of that is yet to be found, and to prove commercially viable.

business	Audit reforms aim to prevent accounting scandals	"A review into how company books are inspected has been announced in a bid to prevent future accounting scandals and business collapses.
Ministers have been under pressure to overhaul auditing rules after failures like Carillion, BHS and Thomas Cook.
government has created a new watchdog, the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA).
But critics called the plan ""watered down"" and said auditors should be doing their jobs properly in the first place.
government said the reforms ""will help prevent sudden large-scale collapses like Carillion and BHS, which hurt countless small businesses and led to job losses.""
f Carillion and BHS cost in excess of 20,000 jobs and saw their auditors fined more than £25m in total.
mpanies failed despite their accounts being signed off by one of the so-called ""Big Four"" globally recognised auditors - EY, KMPG, PWC and Deloitte. 
government promised change and after several independent investigations, it has finally announced a revamp.
w ARGA will replace the Financial Reporting Council. It will now cover unlisted companies with more than 750 employees and a greater than £750 million annual turnover.
reak up the dominance of the Big Four auditors companies listed on the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 will be forced to assign at least part of their audits to smaller firms.
ARGA will also have new powers to be able to investigate and fine directors of large companies if they breach their duties around corporate reporting and audit.
Meanwhile, rules for small businesses will be relaxed as the government said they could be ""forcing too many of Britain's smallest businesses to spend time and money preparing accounts to a level of detail only needed for larger companies, distracting them from focussing on growth and creating jobs. ""
Accounting is not the sexiest subject in the world. But a sense of trust in the financial information presented to regulators, investors and customers is important particularly after it has been shattered by big companies suddenly going bust.
government will establish a new watchdog, a requirement that larger companies have to employ an auditor outside of the Big Four and bringing large privately owned firms and some local authorities onto the regulators radar.
However, in a post-Brexit world the government is keen not to be seen to be imposing new burdens on business and has watered down its initial proposals thereby excluding hundreds of large private companies and smaller businesses from the additional requirements. 
When plans for an audit reform were put in a government white paper last year the threshold had been all private companies with more than 500 employees and a turnover of more than £500m.
roposal would have almost doubled the number of companies deemed ""public interest entities"" that are subject to stricter reporting requirements to about 4,000.
m Bush, head of governance and financial analysis at Pensions and Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) said: ""The key message is that reform needs to be tasking auditors with the product they are supposed to be delivering already, not lobbying for watered down products that are useless.""
Minister for corporate responsibility Lord Callanan said: ""Collapses like Carillion have made it clear that audit needs to improve, and these reforms will ensure the UK sets a global standard.
""By restoring confidence in audit and corporate reporting we will strengthen the foundations of UK plc, so it can drive growth and job creation across the country."""	/news/business-61637032
business	Is this how Scotland's nationalised railway is meant to look?	"Your ScotRail train may or may not depart on time. It depends if the crew were to be on overtime or not. This is ScotRail's second 24-hour strike by RMT transport union members, to add to all those one-day stoppages in protest at other rail companies.
Is this how a newly nationalised rail service is meant to look? 
first RMT strike over ScotRail's pay offer was earlier this month, on the day the SNP conference departed Aberdeen. 
Members moved from a vision of a greener, smooth-running Scotland in the P&J Arena to the city centre, and a clunking re-engagement with a very different reality on the rails.
When they do run, trains south of Aberdeen are all diesel. There's a lot of work to do, and a lot of money to find, if ScotRail is to meet expectations of the public ownership that began just over six months ago, and if it's to banish diesel from the fleet, as intended, within only 13 years.
re's pressure on Jenny Gilruth, Scotland's transport minister, to deliver cheaper fares, more carriages, and free tickets for young people, just as they can get free travel on buses up to the age of 22.
She's being told to re-open rail lines, as they've done in the Borders, Alloa, and they'll soon do in south-east Fife.
If Aberdeen is to become, as the First Minister ambitiously claimed, ""the net zero capital of the world"", it is going to need some greener rail options. It won't get electric trains linking to Dundee until 2030, and there's a case being made for reinstatement of a rail link with Peterhead.
It would be nice, on a strike day or any other, to have the alternative option of a direct Citylink coach service between Aberdeen and Inverness. But no such service exists. Incredibly, you have to change at the Broxden interchange near Perth. 
I used it recently, with foreign tourists who were left with little shelter and less information, while unable even to get into Perth city centre. The Broxden car park has become a pivot point for Scottish road travel, but is surely one of the nation's most dismal places.
Just one of the big problems for Scotland's rail, as with much of the rest of Britain, is that it's coming back into public ownership, or at least control, at a time when there's an almighty squeeze looming for public funding.
Experience tells us that long-term infrastructure, such as rail, is the first and easiest area of public spending to squeeze.
r notable, current problem is that the pandemic has upended the market for passenger travel. And while most other markets are re-conforming to roughly their previous shape, rail seems to have changed permanently.
Strikes this year are not only because earnings are failing to keep pace with price inflation, but because staff have good reason to think that big changes are on the way, and they won't be comfortable for staff.
ScotRail has the lowest level of passenger recovery of any of the major British franchises. In April to June, it had only 61% of the numbers it was carrying before the pandemic.  
It is making only 75% of the revenue from that time - an improvement, at least, on the 9% of revenue in the depths of lockdown, when vast public subsidy was required to keep any trains running.
ravel for leisure has picked up significantly since coming out of Covid restrictions. But commuting has not. Use of season tickets across the network during spring were at only 34% of pre-pandemic levels.
Many people have not returned to office work. Those who do are often doing so for fewer days per week, enjoying the flexibility to leave home later in the morning and avoid peak time fares. ScotRail says that a high proportion of its customers have moved homes or jobs since 2020.
f peak time is hard baked into railway ticketing, while air and bus travel has adapted to pricing models in which ticket prices adapt to demand. 
We've been told there will be an end to the absurdities of return tickets being less expensive than single journeys, and saving money by buying a ticket for a station beyond your destination because that is cheaper. 
We've awaited a Scottish version of London's Oyster Card for so long that the Oyster Card has itself been replaced by smarter ways to get the best deal simply using a payment card. 
You'll know what I mean if you use Lothian Buses, but you won't find much that joins up. A seemingly simple journey requires not only different tickets but different apps.
Surveys suggest that passengers have a fairly high satisfaction rating with Scottish trains. They are looking for reliability, safety, clean toilets and for some of them (mainly men) speed.
makes it more difficult to explain why the vast bulk of railway spending for now, and quite a few years to come, will be on improving resilience against extreme weather and taking carbon off the tracks. 
It's something that passengers are only likely to notice when they breathe the cleaner air in Glasgow Queen Street station, but they will pay much of the price.
Alex Hynes, managing director of ScotRail, was in Inverness recently, and took time with journalists to explain some big challenges ahead.
ude the replacement of diesel on lines running north of Perth and Dundee. Options are currently being considered for how to put an overhead cable on tracks between Inverness and Perth.  It might be possible as far north as Tain in Easter Ross. 
But on the Kyle of Lochalsh line, between Inverness and Aberdeen, and from Tain north to Caithness, different options will have to be considered.
Hydrogen is one. Germany is already running hydrogen-powered trains. They have been trialled in Britain. We have moved sharply this year, thanks in large part to Vladimir Putin, from hydrogen being a distant wish on the horizon to an industry that's about to take off.
It's not clean and green, however, if it's 'blue hydrogen' and being sourced from gas. 'Green hydrogen' requires renewable power to derive it from water, and that is pricey.
Wider gauge trains on the continent, along with bigger bridge and tunnel spaces, allow for designers to put hydrogen in the roof space above passengers heads.  British trains may have to tow hydrogen tanks in an extra carriage.
Highland lines in particular have some exceptionally tight bridges and tunnels. Replacing Victorian bridges to create space for electric cables is extraordinarily expensive and disruptive - as anyone in Glasgow can see from the year-long replacement of just one bridge where Pollokshields meets Strathbungo.
fficulty for planning ahead is that the technology and the relative prices keep changing.  Electrification is today's technology, and works best in urban areas.
Hydrogen is very expensive now, but the price of sourcing it and running trains on it could fall sharply.  Battery power has already seen that happen, as the distance range of trains - as with battery cars - has risen sharply. But they are not yet able to plan on batteries getting trains as far north as Wick and Thurso.
Alex Hynes claims that Scottish railways are doing better than England at reducing the cost of electrification, at £2m per track kilometre compared with England's £3m. 
's a big improvement on the late and over-budget electrification of the main Glasgow-Edinburgh line through Linlithgow. 
ScotRail boss has recently been finding out how Denmark's railways have got that cost down to £1.5m. 
Among his next tasks is to start ordering new fleets: Next year battery-electric, the year after for rural lines, and the year after that, replacement of the intercity fleet. They're looking at replacing not just the trains, but at ownership in place of leasing trains.
It's a colossal task to achieve these net zero targets, and that's just rail. The easy option is for the First Minister to attend the COP27 climate change gathering in Egypt, to follow up on the profile she gained last November in Glasgow.
But a recent report from the Reform Scotland think tank points out that big, difficult decisions are not being made, which risk unpopularity, but it argues they will become essential - no more new buildings heated with gas, no new gas cooking hobs, and pay-as-you-drive road pricing.
report identified 45 Scottish government targets for achieving that net zero vision, while noting the lack of monitoring or accountability for failing to hit them.
It sees a gap between rhetoric and reality in what will be required for changes to individual lifestyles and freedoms.
k tank's Alison Payne observes: ""Without transparent and accountable tracking of these goals, there is a danger they become worthless.
""There is a long way to go, but we can reach the end of the journey by taking bolder steps now."""	/news/uk-scotland-63438020
business	Petrol prices: Calls for more help as cost to fill a tank hits £100	"Driving groups have called for more support to help drivers after the cost of filling an average family car with petrol hit £100 for the first time. 
RAC motoring group called it ""a truly dark day"" as the cost of filling a 55-litre tank reached £100.27 for petrol and £103.43 for diesel.
RAC and its rival the AA urged the chancellor to cut VAT on fuel or to reduce fuel duty further. 
reasury said it had provided £37bn to ease the cost of living already.
Rising petrol prices are putting pressure on household budgets, with energy bills and food prices also now at multi-year highs. 
Pump prices began to soar after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February led to oil supply fears. However, there are concerns that petrol retailers are not passing on a recent 5p cut in fuel duty to consumers. 
According to the RAC, the average pump price of a litre of unleaded petrol is now 182.31p while for diesel it is 188.05p. However, the motoring group has warned this could rise to over £2 a litre soon. 
RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""While fuel prices have been setting new records on a daily basis, households up and down the country may never have expected to see the cost of filling an average-sized family car reach three figures.
""A further duty cut or a temporary reduction in VAT would go a long way towards helping drivers, especially those on lower incomes who have no choice other than to drive.""
AA called on the government to cut fuel duty by 10p per litre immediately and introduce a ""fuel price stabiliser"", which would reduce fuel duty when petrol prices go up and increase it when they drop.
wholesale price of petrol - the price at which supermarkets and independent forecourts buy it at - has actually dropped by 5p since 1 June, when it was £1.55 a litre, to £1.50 on Wednesday. 
But motoring groups say it takes time for changes in the wholesale price to feed through to the pumps due to the way retailers buy fuel in advance.
It comes as some UK forecourts are already selling petrol above £2 a litre, according to price comparison website PetrolPrices.
On Wednesday, the highest price was found to be 202.9p a litre at BP sites on the A1 near Sunderland, the M4 near Chippenham in Wiltshire and the M6 near Burton-in-Kendal, Cumbria.
Ewan, 31, told the BBC he needed a car to get to work in centre of Aberdeen, otherwise it was a one-and-a-half hour bus journey. But he said he was now paying up to £90 to fill a tank and the petrol expenses he could claim through work were no longer enough. 
rvant, who lives alone, said it was just one more thing pushing up the cost of living and he was now ""barely"" getting by. 
""I used to be able to save about £200 a month but now I am dipping into savings,"" he said. ""It makes me quite stressed out.""
RAC argues the Treasury could afford to offer more help, as the higher fuel prices rise, the more it collects in VAT receipts - currently around 30p per litre. 
It added that despite March's fuel duty cut, the government still collects 53p in duty on every litre sold. 
government has so far ruled out cutting VAT, arguing that any increases in receipts it gets from higher fuel prices will be largely offset by reduced household spending and VAT on other items. It has no plans to cut fuel duty either. 
Instead, Downing Street has indicated that fuel retailers failing to pass on the 5p duty cut could be named and shamed.
Answering questions from journalists in Blackpool, Boris Johnson said: ""What I want to see is those cuts in taxation not just swallowed up in one gulp, without touching the gullet of the fuel companies, I want to see those cuts having an impact on the pumps.
""And we are watching very closely to see what happens.""
Lisa Stevenson, who owns Tolladine service station near Worcester, told the BBC her prices per litre - at 197.9p for unleaded and 194.9p for diesel - were purely the result of volatile wholesale fuel prices driven by the Ukraine war. 
She added that customers were now buying less fuel because of the soaring costs: ""A delivery of fuel would previously have lasted me a week to 10 days, now its 2-3 weeks.""
Alasdair Locke, chairman of Motor Fuel Group, the UK's largest independent forecourt operator, told the BBC's Today programme that his business had passed on the 5p duty cut to consumers ""immediately"".
""It would be easy if there was evidence we're just profiteering but there is no evidence of that, in fact rather the opposite. Our margins are under pressure, along with everyone else's.""
Commenting on the rising pump prices, a government spokesperson said: ""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices which is why we have acted to protect the eight million most vulnerable British families through at least £1,200 of direct payments this year with additional support for pensioners and those claiming disability benefits.""
mployee would save more than £330 a year through a tax cut in July, while the 5p cut to fuel duty would save a typical family £100."	/news/business-61743734
business	Digital skills shortage 'limiting growth' on IOM, says business leader	"A lack of digitally skilled workers continues to hamper growth for some Manx firms, the head of the island's Chamber of Commerce said. 
Kristan McDonald said it was impacting the Isle of Man's financial services and e-gaming sectors.
Labour market data shows the Isle of Man had low unemployment rates in 2022, with a high number of vacancies.
Mr McDonald said the island was struggling to attract those with digital skills.
Countries like Portugal were doing a ""good job"" in recruiting them by using legislation and offering incentives to live and work there, he added. 
""For a lot of people it doesn't matter where you are and what time zone you are in as long as the work gets done, so why not live somewhere that's really nice, and has a vibrant outside of work culture."" 
But the Isle of Man does not ""have a lot of that, in all honesty"", so the government must focus its efforts instead on removing barriers and creating incentives for those who want to relocate, Mr McDonald said.
Without this, firms will ""carry on establishing brass plaques here"" and employ workers elsewhere, which ""doesn't help us"", he added.
A government plan to create 5,000 new jobs on the island by 2032 includes plans to invest in developing skills through the education system.
It also includes commitments to improve infrastructure on the island to make it a more attractive relocation option.
mber of commerce still held frustrations about the responsiveness of the civil service, and its ability to collectively deal with issues like recruitment, Mr McDonald said.
, which represents hundreds of Manx business, had put proposals to retrain workers and skill people coming out of education to the government earlier this year, he added.
But after some ""really good initial engagement"" the work ""fell into a black hole"" and progress stalled, Mr McDonald said. 
And he admitted it had been a challenging year for both government and the private sector due to soaring energy costs and record inflation.

business	Snapchat owner hit as advertising slump hits sales	"Shares in the owner of social media platform Snapchat have plummeted after it missed revenue expectations and warned it faces ""incredibly challenging"" conditions.
firm says advertisers cut spending as they face supply chain disruptions.
Snap shares slumped by more than 25% in after-hours trade in New York.
Shares in technology giants including, Facebook owner Meta and Google's parent company Alphabet, also fell on concerns about economic headwinds.
After US markets closed on Thursday, Snap reported revenue of $1.11bn (£926m) for the three months to the end of June, which missed Wall Street expectations.
mpany said some of its advertisers had cut spending as they faced rising costs, supply chain disruptions and labour shortages.
firm also said privacy changes to iPhones, economic challenges, and increasingly tough competition for advertisers had ""substantially slowed"" its revenue growth.
However, daily active users on Snapchat grew to 347m by the end of June, beating forecasts.
It said it now aims to reduce hiring, grow its advertising business and find new sources of revenue.
After the results, shares in major technology firms that also sell online adverts - including Meta, Alphabet, Twitter and Pinterest - lost ground in after-hours trading.
Snap's earnings come ahead of results from larger rivals including Twitter, which is due to release figures later on Friday, while Alphabet is scheduled to post its latest update on Tuesday, followed by Meta on Wednesday.
Snap usually posts its earnings before other social media companies, like Meta, Google and Twitter.

And if Snap's quarterly earnings are anything to go by, there's a problem. 
Social media companies have a very simple business model. The product is free - they make money by selling ads.
Advertisers aren't flocking to Snapchat though. In fact they seem decidedly nervous.
ften a sign that the economy is flagging - that people aren't spending as much as they used to.
But there are other factors at play too.
Last year, Apple introduced policies that let users opt out of personalised ads. 
rrible for companies like Snap - that have for years charged advertisers eye-watering sums for the privilege of targeting their users.
And the phenomenal success of TikTok is hurting the older generation of social media companies - as they lose eyeballs to the Chinese-owned platform.

business	Shell fined for overcharging pre-payment customers	"Shell has been fined more than £500,000 for overcharging thousands of customers on pre-payment meters since the energy price cap was introduced in 2019.
giant's home energy supplier failed to implement rate changes to meters due to ""operational errors"". 
Ofgem said: ""Overcharging by suppliers can cause additional and unnecessary stress and worry at what is already a very challenging time for consumers."" 
regulator will announce changes to the energy price cap on Friday.
rgy price cap is the maximum amount suppliers can charge domestic customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy.
w cap - which will come into force on 1 October - is forecast to lift the typical household energy bill to around £3,600.
It comes as millions across the country face the fastest rise in the cost of living for four decades. Meanwhile, Shell recently reported record profits of $11.5bn (£9bn) between April and June alone.
Ofgem found that over a period of more than three years since the price cap was introduced in January 2019, Shell overcharged more than 11,000 households, resulting in them having paid above the price cap. 
rrors were made when tariff updates were sent to people's prepayment meters to amend rates in response to changes in the level of the price cap, but Shell said that due to a ""variety of operational issues"", not all meters were successfully altered.
Affected customers will be automatically refunded from a total £106,000 and Shell will also pay £400,000 to Ofgem's voluntary consumer redress fund. 
Customers will also get payments from a total of £30,970 in goodwill from the oil giant, which identified the errors and alerted Ofgem. 
Out of 22 million households paying the price cap, around 4.5 million are prepayment meter customers who are among some of the country's poorest and most vulnerable households.
rity Citizens Advice has warned that these energy customers are more likely to be on the lowest incomes. 
Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said: ""Ofgem expects suppliers to adhere to the terms of contracts they have with customers, particularly ensuring they pay no more than the level of the price cap.""
A spokesperson for Shell Energy said: ""We are sincerely sorry that errors updating our prepayment meter rates resulted in some customers being overcharged for a period of time.
""As soon as we identified the issue we began taking steps to put it right and self-reported it to Ofgem. The overcharge, which averages £9.40 per customer, will be refunded along with a gesture of goodwill."""	/news/business-62672781
business	Five-year mortgage rates back below 6%	"queeze on people renewing or trying to get new mortgages has eased slightly, according to new data.
rage five-year fixed mortgage rate fell below 6% for the first time in seven weeks on Tuesday, and remained there on Wednesday, the financial information service Moneyfacts said.
Mortgage rates spiked after the government's mini-Budget in September, driving up costs for borrowers.
Rates have stabilised since the Autumn Statement last week, experts say.
Average five-year mortgage rates hit 5.95% on Tuesday, and remained at the same rate on Wednesday, Moneyfacts said. This is down from a high of 6.51% on 20 October.
rates on two-year mortgages, which are more common, have also been falling gradually, from 6.65% on 20 October to 6.14%. 
Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts, said: ""Borrowers who paused their home ownership plans, or indeed parked the idea of refinancing, may now be tempted to scrutinise the latest deals on offer.
""However, it is worth noting that rates could fall further still, but there is no clear answer as to how quickly that may be.""
Despite the fall, rates are still high compared with this time last year, when they were closer to 2.5%.
At least 100,000 people per month are coming to the end of their current mortgage deal, and face steep rises in monthly repayments.
Rates have climbed throughout this year, as the Bank of England put up interest rates to fight inflation, but they rocketed upwards following the mini-Budget. 
Former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng promised major tax cuts without saying how he'd pay for them, sparking turmoil on financial markets.
UK borrowing costs spiked, having a direct impact on the mortgage market, where thousands of products were suspended due to uncertainty about how to price those loans. 
umber of deals available has mainly recovered but it is still much lower than it was last year. 
Jeremy Cox, head of strategy at Coventry Building Society, told the BBC the Autumn Statement had helped to bring down mortgage rates by giving markets ""greater confidence in the fiscal outlook for the UK"".
New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has reversed most of Mr Kwasi's plans while promising £55bn in tax rises and spending cuts designed to get the economy back on track. 
Mr Cox said the pace of the rise in the cost of living was ""still very high"" in the UK, but US inflation was starting to fall, ""and that will hopefully mean that [UK] interest rates will not have to keep on rising at the pace they have been"".

business	McDonald's to leave Russia for good after 30 years	"Watch: Moscow residents react to McDonald's leaving Russia after 30 years
McDonald's has said it will permanently leave Russia after more than 30 years and has started to sell its restaurants. 
move comes after it temporarily closed its 850 outlets in March.
fast food giant said it made the decision because of the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the Ukraine war.
g of McDonald's first restaurant in Moscow in 1990 came to symbolise a thaw in Cold War tensions. 
A year later, the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia opened up its economy to companies from the West. More than three decades later, however, it is one of a growing number of corporations pulling out.
""This is a complicated issue that's without precedent and with profound consequences,"" said McDonald's chief executive Chris Kempczinski in a message to staff and suppliers.
""Some might argue that providing access to food and continuing to employ tens of thousands of ordinary citizens, is surely the right thing to do,"" he added.
""But it is impossible to ignore the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. And it is impossible to imagine the Golden Arches representing the same hope and promise that led us to enter the Russian market 32 years ago.""
McDonald's said it would sell all its sites to a local buyer and would begin the process of ""de-arching"" the restaurants which involves removing its name, branding and menu. It will retain its trademarks in Russia. 
riorities included seeking to ensure its 62,000 employees in Russia continued to be paid until any sale was completed and that they had ""future employment with any potential buyer"".
McDonald's said it would write off a charge of up to $1.4bn (£1.1bn) to cover the exit from its investment.  
It really is the end of an era. I was in the queue when the first Russian McDonald's opened on Moscow's Pushkin Square in January 1990 - way back in the USSR. 
re were so many people outside the restaurant, it took three hours to get inside. But what a sense of excitement. 
American burgers, fries and pies were a symbol of Moscow embracing the West. Hot food to help end a Cold War. 
re very different times. Russia and the West have lost their appetite for one another. 
Russia's attack on Ukraine has sparked international condemnation and sanctions, turning Moscow into a pariah. 
Meanwhile, the Kremlin - as it always does - points the finger back, accusing the West of plotting Russia's downfall. 
Back in March lots of international companies announced they were pausing operations in Russia, hoping the situation would resolve itself and they could then reopen.
But McDonald's decision to sell up and pull out shows the fast food giant recognises things will not return to normal and that what the Kremlin calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine has changed things long term.
Big Macs are only the beginning. I predict we're going to see a lot more global brands leaving Russia.
move comes after Renault announced it was selling its business in the country. The French firm said its 68% stake in carmaker Avtovaz would be sold to a Russian science institute, while its shares in Renault Russia will go to the city of Moscow. 
Moscow said Renault's Russian assets had now become state property - marking the first nationalisation of a major foreign business since the invasion of Ukraine.
Last year, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 9% of McDonald's global sales.
's 108 restaurants in Ukraine remain closed due to the conflict but the company is continuing to pay full salaries to all its employees there.
McDonald's initially faced criticism for being slow to halt its business in Russia, with some calling for a boycott of the company before it suspended operations in March.
Hundreds of international brands, including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple, have left Russia or suspended sales there since the country invaded Ukraine in February.

business	House sales peak in July but buyers are cautious	"More homes were sold in the UK in July than in any other month this year, official figures show, but agents say buyers are showing more caution.
Cost-of-living pressures were leading some to negotiate harder for a lower price, agents said.
A total of 110,970 properties were sold in the UK during the month - the highest since September, HM Revenue and Customs data shows.
Activity in the housing market usually picks up during the warmer months.
Sales surged during, and despite of, the pandemic as people searched for more inside and outdoor space, then slowed in the second half of last year.
Consistent monthly sales of around 100,000 this year show that demand remains comparatively strong, but there are signs that the squeeze on budgets caused by rising prices and bills were having an effect.
Sales in July were still 33% higher than the same month last year and 7.2% higher than June, HMRC said.
Nathan Emerson, chief executive of the estate agents' trade body Propertymark, said: ""These figures show the housing market remains stable with transactions up month-on-month, year-on-year and well above pre-pandemic levels.
""The cost of living is still rising and we are seeing evidence of buyers negotiating harder, bringing price increases down. But our data from member agents shows the demand remains strong and that there with not enough stock to go round with the number of new potential buyers seven times higher than new homes coming to the market.""
Other commentators have suggested that more nervous buyers could lead to lower prices. Property portal Rightmove recently suggested that asking prices had dropped for the first time this year in August.
North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said ""concerns about the rising cost of living and interest rates are prompting a more cautious approach"" from buyers, which meant sales were taking a little longer than previously.
Bank of England has regularly raised interest rates as the cost of living has soared, meaning new buyers are facing more expensive mortgages than seen in recent years.
Julie-Ann Haines, chief executive of the Principality Building Society, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that another 1.8 million homeowners were coming to the end of a fixed-rate home loan next year, so demand and pressure on banks and building societies was increasing.
She added that there were no signs of a UK housing market crash, although a slowdown was more likely."	/news/business-62646676

""They have changed the way women's football is viewed in this country,"" former England international and TV pundit Alex Scott told the BBC.
""The train has left the station and it is gathering pace.""
uld lead to more generous sponsorship deals, experts reckon, as well as encouraging higher wages for the top stars.
England's top earners are reported to make around £200,000 a year from club football. 
Star defender Lucy Bronze already has endorsement deals with brands such as Pepsi, EE and Visa, to add to her salary.
England's captain Leah Williamson recently agreed a deal with Italian fashion house Gucci, alongside existing agreements with Pepsi and Nike.
But that should just be the beginning for the English stars who have the example of Norway's Ada Hegerberg to aim for: Hegerberg recently landed a £1m-plus deal with Nike.
Average wages in the Women's Super League are estimated at around £47,000, with some players reportedly earning as little as £20,000 a year.
But the Lionesses' success could help wages to rise closer to the likes of European giants Lyon, which is believed to hand its top players €500,000 (£420,000) per season.
When Chloe Kelly ditched her shirt after scoring England's winning goal in Sunday's Euro 2022 final, she replicated what up until then had been the defining moment for the women's game.
US defender Brandi Chastain removed her top after scoring the winning penalty in the 1999 Women's World Cup.
move became the sport's iconic image and netted the player an estimated $2m Nike sponsorship deal.
In beating Germany, England's Lionesses have created a fresh defining moment for women's football and the impact on the wider women's game is set to be enormous.
Sunday's triumph in front of a record attendance indicates that women's football has captured the hearts of fans, and has also caught the attention of businesses now keen to be associated with the game.
Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham said the victory would have an enduring impact. 
""I think it will really turbo charge everything we have been doing in the women's game,"" he told BBC Breakfast.
""There is no reason why we shouldn't have the same number of girls playing as boys and it will inspire a whole new generation of players.""
Euro 2022 marked the first time that sponsorship was offered just for the women's tournament, rather than deals being bundled with the men's tournament as in the past. Analysts at Neilsen Sports estimate that decision was a financially astute one.
Attracting big names such as Visa, Heineken, Lego and Pepsi has helped increase organiser Uefa's revenue stream by £25-£33m per year, they say.
Other tournament sponsors include Booking.com, Euronics, Grifols, Hisense, Just Eat Takeaway.com, Volkswagen, Adidas, Hublot, Nike, TikTok, LinkedIn, Pandora, Starling Bank and Gillette Venus.
""We're now seeing the results of the FA and Uefa investing in, and backing, women's football over a number of years, and it's bearing very strong results,"" said Lynsey Douglas, global lead, women's sports at Neilsen.
uld help the women's grassroots game but also help raise the profile of other women's sports.
Women's rugby and cricket has been pushed into the public eye in the Commonwealth Games, for instance, offering more interesting sponsorship opportunities for brands.
Increasing numbers of television viewers have helped improve the Lionesses' marketability.
Sunday's final recorded a peak TV audience of 17.4 million, a record for a women's football match in the UK.
""Viewership normally determines the magnitude of sponsorship and endorsement deals, so this tournament will be a catalyst for a business revolution in the women's game,"" said marketing expert Andrew Bloch, who has worked with the likes of Nike, Pepsi, Puma, Adidas and EA Games. 
With the Lionesses becoming household names, their marketing value will rocket, said Lisa Parfitt, co-founder of sports marketing agency The Space Between.
But women's sport can prove to be a more attractive proposition than men's sport, she said.
""The Lionesses have provided the perfect shop window for brands looking for potential for sponsorship in their marketing campaigns,"" she said.
It's more affordable than men's sponsorship but the value is different, she pointed out. ""Women's football has enormous reach, but women's sport fans are for more likely to be an advocate for a brand's sponsors, and far more likely to buy those brands' products.""
In short, she reckons sponsoring women's sport can offer much better value.
Data from Neilsen Fan Insights backs that up by revealing that fans of women's football are more gender balanced and younger than fans of men's football - an attractive combination for brands.
""There's been much talk over the years about watershed moments for women's sport, but there is no doubt we are truly experiencing one at the moment,"" said Annie Panter, who played in Team GB's medal-winning London 2012 hockey team, but is now managing director at sports marketing agency Two Circles.
She said much of the previous sponsorship in women's football has been down to companies wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing to meet corporate social responsibility targets.
Lionesses' success means ""women's football now represents a powerful purpose-led sponsorship platform that generates genuine commercial return on investment for a brand.""
Natalie Quail, chief marketing officer at oral cosmetics firm SmileTime said the success has helped persuade brands like hers to engage with female football stars.
""We are now actively interested in sponsoring the sport because ultimately that's where we're seeing an emerging interest trending with our majority female customer base,"" she said.
She predicted the likes of rapid-growth e-commerce brands such as Gymshark, Pretty Little Thing and Asos ""will be looking to do the same"".
""More and more brands - at least the savvy ones - are recognising the commercial value of women's football,"" said Eric Fulwiler, chief executive of marketing consultancy Rival. 
""It's underpriced compared to men's football and the current success of the Lionesses will help start to close the commercial gap with the men.""
Alessia Russo's back-heel against Sweden and the nature of the win against Germany has helped women's sport finally get recognition for the quality of performances.
But the disparity between male and female earnings still has a long way to go.
Lionesses have been reported to be earning a £55,000 bonus per player for winning the tournament.
£1.3m handout to the squad would be much lower than the bonus of £5m that England's men had been reported to have received if they had won last summer's Euros.
""To truly capitalise on this competition's legacy from a commercial investment perspective we need to ensure that we translate audiences to domestic leagues, like the WSL, and to the Uefa Women's Champions League to create sustained growth in fandom,"" said Annie Panter."	/news/business-62320684

group's loss for the year to 31 March was smaller than expected and narrowed from the €1.02bn (£867m) losses seen the previous year.
Mr O'Leary said he expected prices to be lower up to June compared to pre-pandemic levels, but added ""based on about 50% of all bookings, we expect prices will be up high single-digit per cent"" over the Summer.
""It seems to us that there will be higher prices into that peak summer period because there's so much demand for the beaches of Europe and those price rises going to continue,"" told the BBC's Today programme.
""I think prices will be low next winter. But it's too early to say, there's clearly going to be an economic downturn, there's some fear of recession and in a recession the lowest-cost provider, which in the UK and in Europe is Ryanair, will do better, but will do better because we can sustain lower prices.""
In its results the airline stated customers were still booking their trips later than usual and said the ""booking curve"" looked more like pre-Covid times.
Ryanair said traffic recovered strongly as it carried 97.1 million guests, up from just 27.5 million the year before thanks to the lifting of pandemic restrictions.
It said it hopes to boost this further to 165 million passengers this year - ahead of the 149 million record level seen pre-Covid.
Elsewhere, Holiday giant Tui has said it expects summer bookings to ""almost reach"" 2019 levels this year, but warned there will be ""no last minute"" deals.
""There will be practically no last minute offers at low prices this summer,"" said Fritz Joussen, Tui's chief executive.
Mr O'Leary said he hoped to see ""pinch points"" at UK airports such as Manchester or Heathrow eliminated by the end of June in time for the peak summer period. 
He said: ""There's no doubt I think getting through airports this summer is going to be challenging and we're encouraging all of our customers to show up earlier and allow more time to get through airport security"". 
However he claimed this was less the case at other airports Ryanair uses, such as Glasgow, Stansted, and Bristol.
He said Ryanair didn't face the same recruitment challenges as some competitors because it had kept people on. 
Ryanair asked staff to take pay cuts during the pandemic to avoid job losses."	/news/business-61463274
business	Covid-19: Japan reopens to tourists - but with strict rules	"Neasa Ronayne plans to visit Japan for the first time this year. 
She has paid more than £3,500 ($4,390) for a 16-day tour, as under the country's Covid-19 restrictions she is not allowed to roam around on her own.
But Ms Ronayne, who lives in the UK, is still keen to make the trip.
""This will be my first time in Japan and also my first time in Asia. I am looking forward to it. I have been watching [Japanese reality TV show] Terrace House to learn some phrases,"" she said.
She is not alone. Several travel agencies have told the BBC they were seeing a jump in inquiries about holidays to Japan - although the country's strict regulations are still keeping some visitors away.
Japan has been largely closed to foreign visitors since 2020, as it implemented some of the world's toughest Covid-19 restrictions. And even now, as it opens its borders to tourists from nearly 100 countries and regions on Friday, it is putting new restrictions in place.
udes the requirement for travellers to be part of a package tour. They must also buy medical insurance and wear masks in all public places, including outside.
Under the rules, tourists will also have to avoid the so-called ""three Cs"": closed spaces, crowded places and close contact settings.
Earlier this week, the Japan Tourism Agency said tour leaders needed to accompany visitors ""from entry to departure"", while reminding them of Covid requirements like mask wearing.
""Tour guides should frequently remind tour participants of necessary infection prevention measures, including wearing and removing masks, at each stage of the tour,"" the agency said in 16 pages of guidelines issued on Tuesday.
""Even outdoors, the wearing of masks should continue in situations where people are conversing in close proximity,"" it added. 
Still, travel agencies say they have seen a surge in interest in visiting the country.
Singapore's Chan Brothers Travel said it had received bookings for 50 tour groups to Japan, with each including as many as 30 people. 
Its spokesperson, Jeremiah Wong, told the BBC that inquiries have been ""streaming in exponentially"" since Japan's reopening was announced.
""To make up for the time lost in the past two years or more, travellers have no qualms going on their long-awaited holidays,"" Mr Wong said. 
But he is unsure when the company's first post-pandemic tour to Japan will be able to go ahead: ""The potentially earliest departure will be after mid-July due to the requirement for tourist visa application... for all travellers.""
Zina Bencheikh, the managing director of Intrepid Travel, said there was a ""huge pent up demand to visit Japan"".
Her firm hopes to restart its tours - which cover popular destinations like Mount Fuji - from August. But Ms Bencheikh said it was still in the process of getting approval from the Japanese authorities.
Japan has barred most foreign visitors for the last two years as it imposed measures to slow the spread of Covid-19. Last year, overseas visitors were even banned from the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. 
untry only relaxed travel restrictions for foreign residents and business travellers earlier this year. 
Last month, Japan said it would double the daily limit for foreign arrivals to 20,000.
""modest reopening strategy"" will not bring much benefit to the Japanese economy - which is the world's third largest, said Kentaro Koyama, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Japan.
""The government's response has been rather delayed. The aging Japanese population is more fearful of infection than other countries,"" Mr Koyama said.
Before the pandemic tourism was big business in Japan with a record 31.9m foreign visitors to the country in 2019. Last year, there were fewer than 250,000.
But the tourism industry of this once-popular Asian destination still has some way to go on the road to recovery.
Rad Sappany told the BBC that she has dropped her plans to visit Japan next month from Australia because of the restrictions.
""We are not interested in a package tour - it's not the way we like to travel,"" she said.
Wanping Aw, who runs Japan-focussed boutique travel agency TokudAw, said her company has not secured any bookings, despite getting two to three enquires every day.
""We do not have any finalised bookings yet as no one is willing to make a commitment,"" she said.
Ms Aw added: ""'We do not want to be guinea pigs' is a phrase I often hear.""

More than 11 million pensioners will receive regular winter fuel payments boosted by an extra £300 this year.
A million people on tax credits can also expect to see a second cost-of-living payment arrive in their bank accounts over the next week.

""We want to do everything we can to support pensioners who are often the most exposed to higher costs,"" said Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride. 
""As we deal with the impact of Putin's illegal war in Ukraine and the aftermath of the pandemic, we will continue to stand by the most vulnerable, with further cost-of-living payments coming next year,"" he added.

Joel Pennington was due to take a three-hour flight to Manchester from Germany. Since his flight was axed, he has spent 25 hours trying to get home.
He flew from Germany to Norway and onto London, where he is waiting to get to Manchester, paying out £700 extra.
He is one of many taking drastic action to get home from their trips abroad.
Airlines have cancelled hundreds of flights over the past week due to staff shortages, with many changes made at short notice over the bank holiday weekend.
While some families never reached their destination or arrived late, others have found their return flights are not operating.
More than 100 flights to and from the UK were cancelled on Monday, according to the data analytics firm Cirium, and dozens more were scrapped on Tuesday.
EasyJet, which is the biggest operator at London Gatwick, has been badly affected by disruption over the past week. The airline initially did not say how many flights it had cancelled on Tuesday, but has now confirmed that 60 have been cancelled to and from the UK in total. 
Wizz Air has also been affected, while British Airways cancelled a large number of services in advance. 
Joel was due to fly home with Lufthansa, which arranged his alternative route.
23-year-old from the Lake District said he was now resting in London at a friend's house as he was ""too exhausted"" to make the final leg of his journey.
""I've just given up and am staying in London for the night. I can't continue travelling right now,"" he said.
Mr Pennington says the experience has affected his mental health, and the stress of the journey home has overshadowed the good time he had on holiday. 
He is not the only one.
Harshal Shah is stuck in Crete after his flight to take his family and two other families home was cancelled on Monday.
Rather than wait for a later EasyJet flight, the group has spent almost £3,000 to fly with Jet2 to Birmingham on Wednesday instead, where they will then get taxis to their homes in London.
Harshal, who spent a week in Crete with his family and friends for their first holiday since before the coronavirus pandemic, said his return flight had been cancelled four hours before it was due to depart on Monday.
He said the next available EasyJet flight was not until Thursday, so he decided to make alternative plans.
Harshal told the BBC he had to pay out £6,000 in total for the new flights, accommodation and food for two further nights and said he had received ""no response at all"" from EasyJet.
""The communication in terms of everything is shocking,"" he added. ""Honestly, EasyJet, they should not be EasyJet at all - it's not easy at all.""
Alex Settle, a police officer from Hull, and her hen party of 14 were told their flight from Portugal to Manchester had been cancelled by EasyJet when they arrived at the airport.
EasyJet re-booked them on a Wednesday flight back to UK - but the group were worried about further delays so booked a Jet2 flight for Tuesday instead. 
Each of them is having to pay £366 for the new flight and an extra night's stay.
""It's been really stressful, with lots of tears,"" said Alex. ""This has really tainted the whole trip.

business	Kwasi Kwarteng: We stopped consumer spending collapse	"Chancellor Kwarteng is asked whether the government will stick to past pledges linking pension and benefits rises to inflation.
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said his mini-budget was needed to stop a collapse in consumer spending, despite it sparking days of market turmoil. 
He told his party's MPs that cutting taxes and limiting energy bills had protected the economy. 
, announced last Friday, led to a slump in the pound and the Bank of England stepping in to prevent the collapse of some pension funds.
Mr Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss defended their plans on Thursday.
In a series of BBC interviews, Ms Truss insisted ""urgent action"" was needed to boost the UK economy, adding she was ""prepared to do what it takes to make that happen"" and that the tax cuts outlined last week were the right plan.
mes as a Yougov poll suggested Labour had opened up a massive 33-point lead over the Tories.
Mr Kwarteng tried to bolster support among Tory MPs by sending them a message saying he was working at pace to show markets he had a ""clear plan"". 
r said he understood their concern about the mini-budget, which promised £45bn of tax cuts funded by government borrowing.
Fears this would be unaffordable and drive up interest rates had sent markets into a panic, with government borrowing costs surging, and the pound hitting a record low on Monday.
market turmoil was fuelled by the lack of an independent forecast on the impact of the plans, which had been offered by the Office for Budget Responsibility, but was declined by the government.
Mr Kwarteng insisted the market volatility was ""global"" and being driven by the Ukraine war, Covid, and ""a super strong US dollar"". 
He added that the government had needed to ""act quickly"".
""However I totally understand the need to be credible with markets,"" he told MPs. ""We will show markets our plan is sound, credible and will work to drive growth.""
He said the government would announce reforms in ""childcare, business regulations, financial services, agriculture and more"" over the next six weeks.
Ms Truss also argued market turmoil was being caused by global factors in a series of interviews with BBC local radio stations.
She insisted that ""currencies are under pressure around the world"".
Later, in BBC TV interviews, she said the UK was ""in a very serious situation"" but that was due to ""the aftermath of Covid and Putin's war in Ukraine"".
Watch: PM quizzed on mini-budget by BBC political editors
reasury select committee, which is led by Conservative MP Mel Stride, an ally of former leadership contender Rishi Sunak, rejected the government explanation.
In a letter to Mr Kwarteng on Thursday, Mr Stride said the government plans had ""resulted in various significant and concerning reactions in the markets"".
He said a drop in the price of government bonds following the announcement of the plans was greater than ""any movement during the global financial crisis or the pandemic"".
He said the financial impact of the mini-budget was larger than that of a typical Budget, but there had been no assessment by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to go with it, despite the OBR saying it could produce one.
""It is hard to conclude other than that an absence of a forecast has in some part driven the lack of confidence in the markets,"" he said. ""Some may have formed the unfortunate impression that the government may be seeking to avoid scrutiny.""
OBR said on Thursday it had offered to provide a forecast for the mini-budget, but the chancellor had rejected that.
BBC economics editor Faisal Islam said this absence of a forecast had made the market reaction to the plans worse.
Mr Stride called on Mr Kwarteng to provide an OBR forecast ""earlier"" than 23 November, when the government is due to publish its medium term fiscal plan.
OBR said on Thursday it had been asked by Mr Kwarteng to produce a first draft of its next economic forecasts by 7 October.
In an unusual move, Ms Truss will hold emergency talks with OBR head Richard Hughes on Friday, along with Mr Kwarteng.
Analysis
Zoe Conway, BBC News correspondent
In this message, the chancellor is seeking to reassure MPs that he is working quickly to come up with a plan to calm the markets.
In the face of mounting criticism from his backbenchers, he is also urging them to stay united.
On 23 November, Mr Kwarteng is due to set out his medium term fiscal plan.
He argues this will show how he intends to get debt falling but he has been coming under pressure from Conservative MPs to act more quickly.
re is scepticism among MPs that the economic growth needed to pay for the announced tax cuts and the government's energy bills intervention can be generated quickly enough. 
's why, in this note to Conservative MPs, he says that there are lots of ''ambitious'' supply side reforms coming over the next six weeks.
r might be conciliatory in tone, saying he always values colleagues and that he is ''always available for a meeting'', but there is no hint here that he is prepared to backtrack on any aspect of his economic plan.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Mr Kwarteng rejected claims the government's plans had made people worse off by contributing to a spike in UK mortgage rates.
It is the first time Mr Kwarteng has made a public comment on his mini-budget since Sunday, when he hinted there were more tax cuts to come. 
Since then the plan has faced widespread criticism, with the International Monetary Fund and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney disparaging the plan. 
On Wednesday, the Bank of England was forced to intervene, pledging to buy $65bn of government bonds in a bid to calm markets. 
However, there are concerns the turmoil could continue and fears it might affect the housing market. A record number of mortgage products have been pulled since Friday, amid fears the Bank of England will have to raise interest rates much more sharply than previously expected.
Mr Kwarteng said the government's plan to limit energy bills for households and businesses would save people ""thousands of pounds a year"".
However, the chancellor said it was too early to say whether he would keep the previous government's promise to increase benefits next April in line with inflation. 
He did, however, say the prime minister was committed to reinstating the triple lock on pensions, which means they increase by whichever is highest: inflation, the average wage rise, or 2.5%."	/news/business-63079743
business	Ukraine war: UK imports no fuel from Russia for first time on record	"UK imported no fuel from Russia in June for the first time on record, according to official figures. 
Imports of goods from Russia also fell to £33m in June, the lowest level since records began in January 1997, the Office for National Statics (ONS) said. 
Western nations have imposed strict sanctions on Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February.
UK has pledged to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year and gas imports as soon as possible.
Fuel imports from Russia fell by £499m - or 100% - compared with the average for the previous 12 months to February.
In 2021, the UK imported around 4% of its gas from Russia, and 11% of its oil, according to the International Energy Agency. 
Exports of most goods to Russia had also decreased substantially by June, with machinery and transport equipment sales slashed by 91.3% to £118m.
Overall, exports to Russia dropped by almost 70%, to £168m, compared with the monthly average in the 12 months to February.
roducts to see a slight rise were chemicals, driven by an increase in exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, which are exempt from sanctions.
ONS said that apart from government-stipulated sanctions, trade between Russia and the UK was lessened as businesses voluntarily sought alternatives to Russian goods.
figures were released as Ukraine marked its day of independence, exactly six months since the Russian invasion began. 
As a result of Russia's invasion, the EU has said it will cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year and has also agreed to ban all Russian oil imports which come in by sea by the end of the year. 
Meanwhile, the US has imposed a total ban on Russian oil and gas imports.
't include services, where the UK has in the past made large sums through consultants, accountants and lawyers in London advising Russian companies and wealthy individuals. 
But insofar as we're talking about imported goods, it looks like sanctions have been highly effective. 
According to the ONS we imported no fuel whatsoever from Russia in June, whereas normally we'd import on average about half a billion pounds of it. 
Prior to the war, gas imported from Russia was about 4.9% of total UK gas imports; now it's dropped to zero. 
UK hasn't cut the overall amount of gas it's importing; Russian gas has largely been replaced with gas from elsewhere.
ws clearly the mismatch between the effect of war on the supply to the UK of wholesale gas (modest) and the change to the prices we're paying (huge). 
A lot of the fear built into the price of wholesale gas relates to market speculation on the potential disruptions to supply to Germany, Italy and other Russian-gas-addicted countries. 
Our own gas supply is much more secure. 
Yet because the energy price cap is linked to international wholesale gas prices, the danger is that when the price cap re-sets in October, millions of households will end up paying unnecessarily large bills which have a whole lot of irrelevant fear built into them. "	/news/business-62659391
business	Ukraine war: WTO boss warns of global food crisis	"A food crisis kicked off by the Ukraine war could last for years without intervention, the head of the World Trade Organization has said.
African countries could be hit especially hard by wheat and fertilizer shortages, WTO director general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC.
Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports unable to be exported due to the war. 
She said that was ""really sad"" to see as grain prices soar.
Ukraine is a major global exporter of wheat, contributing to 9% of the global market. It also accounts for a massive 42% chunk of the global sunflower oil market, and 16% of the world's maize.
Because of gridlock due to a Russian blockade of Black Sea ports, and Russian and Ukrainian mines along the coast, between 20 and 25 million tonnes of wheat are stuck in Ukraine while global grain prices spiral upwards.
Ms Okonjo-Iweala said wheat prices had risen 59% compared with last year, sunflower oil was up 30%, while maize was 23% higher.
United Nations is leading efforts to try to establish a ""grain corridor"" with a Turkish naval escort for tankers leaving Odessa and other Ukrainian ports.
But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Ukraine needs to clear mines from its Black Sea ports.
""We state daily that we're ready to guarantee the safety of vessels leaving Ukrainian ports and heading for [Turkish waters], we're ready to do that in cooperation with our Turkish colleagues,"" he said on Wednesday.
Meanwhile Ukraine has said it needs ""effective security guarantees"" before it can start shipments, voicing concerns that Moscow could use the potential corridor to attack Odessa from the sea.
Ukraine typically produces enough to feed 400 million mouths, but Russia stands accused of turning that breadbasket into a stealth missile, with blockaded ports reducing the stream of exports to a trickle.
It is some countries in the Middle East and Africa in particular that will feel the threat of shortages.
Libya and Eritrea get more than 40% of their wheat from Ukraine, and Lebanon more than 60%.
But the pain is global; wheat prices are up a third by since Russia invaded.
re is no quick fix. Even with an agreement for a corridor and the ability to secure sufficient ships, mines will have to be removed from the area to ensure safe passage, which is a lengthy painstaking process.
And already there are warnings that tens of millions of people are at risk of famine, and social unrest erupting in parts of the globe.
It's just a taste of what could be at stake if an agreement fails to materialise, with today's hunger pangs and stretched budgets threatening to spill over into a prolonged devastating economic and social crisis.
Only two million tonnes of grain have been exported from Ukraine via train and in trucks, and Ms Okonjo-Iweala said it was ""critically important to see if we can get an answer"" to the problem.
UN secretary general Antonio Guterres has formed a task force looking at these issues, she said.
""He's spent a lot of time trying to work with Russia to see if an arrangement can be made, so, we'll keep our fingers crossed,"" she said.
If an agreement can't be made, ""this is really going to be a dire situation worldwide"", Ms Okonjo-Iweala said.
She said 35 countries in Africa import food from that Black Sea region, while 22 import fertilizer.
""You can imagine what a big impact this is going to have, even just on the African continent,"" she said. ""I hope that we don't go into a really severe food crisis for the next couple of years.""
She said grain can't be exported from the region at the moment, and there is a harvest coming up in July, ""with a similar quantity that will go to waste, so you can see that this will work its way through for the next year or two, and that will be really disastrous for certain parts of the world"".
She added that supply chain bottlenecks caused by the Covid pandemic and labour shortages exacerbate the issue.
In addition, she called on leaders to relax export restrictions on foodstuffs, which can worsen food price spikes."	/news/business-61727651
business	Prices of pasta, tea, chips and cooking oil soar	"rice of pasta, tea, chips and cooking oil has soared, according to new data, with vegetable oil going up by 65% in a year.
Overall, the price of budget food in supermarkets rose by 17% in the year to September, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
It comes as a separate ONS report sheds light on the cost of living crisis.
Almost half of adults who pay energy bills and 30% paying rent or mortgages say these are difficult to afford.
Inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - is at a 40-year high.
Food prices drove the latest rise in living costs in September, along with energy bills and transport costs.
Earlier this year, anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe criticised the way that the rate of inflation was calculated stating that it ""grossly"" underestimates ""the true cost of living crisis"".
fficial inflation data measures the prices of 700 goods, but since May this year the ONS has started releasing a new data set, which measures the change in price of 30 everyday grocery items across seven supermarkets.
me it has released this data.
It found sharp increases in the price of some household staples in supermarkets. Pasta prices rose by 60% in the year to September 2022, while tea prices went up by almost 50%.
Other everyday items such as chips, bread, biscuits and milk also recorded large increases.
But some other items fell in price during the period, including orange juice and beef mince.
rise in the cost of groceries has been accelerated by the war in Ukraine, which has disrupted grain, oil and fertiliser supplies from the region.
For many families doing a weekly shopping trip has turned into sticker shock, that dismay you feel when you find out just how expensive products are. 
No wonder we're turning, in droves, to cheaper own label products to try to save money. The major supermarkets have been investing heavily to match the discounters, trying to keep a lid on inflation for hundreds of the cheapest, most popular, everyday staples.
But these figures show even these products are going up in price.
Some of the percentage changes are eye watering. The supply of vegetable oil, for instance, has been seriously disrupted by the war in Ukraine and the price has soared.
Rising food prices have a bigger impact on those with the lowest incomes and these figures lay bare the challenges facing Rishi Sunak over the cost of living crisis. 
""What we are seeing is that the price of low-cost goods is going up at the same rate as food across the piece with some real highlights... cooking oil and pasta, I would add tea, chips and bread to that - really going up and very, very few things going down at all,"" the chief executive of the UK Statistics Authority, Prof Sir Ian Diamond, told the BBC.
""We are really seeing that the squeeze on people who buy the lowest cost things is pretty hard at the moment.""
When asked whether things are getting worse, he said: ""I think things are tight. I think we are not seeing much of a getting worse at all but we are seeing things remaining really tight.""

rising cost of living continues to put pressure on household budgets.
A new report by the ONS on Tuesday suggested the proportion of all adults finding it difficult to afford their energy bills, rent or mortgage payments rose during the June to September period.
Around 45% of adults who paid energy bills, and close to a third of those paying rent or mortgages said these were difficult to afford.
figures also suggested disabled people were more likely to have difficulty affording their energy bills, rent or mortgage payments.
Last week, a BBC survey also uncovered growing concern about the squeeze on finances. Some 85% of those asked are now worried about the rising cost of living, up from 69% in a similar poll in January.
In September, the government announced a new Energy Price Guarantee to limit the price that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy.
However, last week, the new chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the support - which limits a typical household bill to £2,500 - will be cut from April. It had originally been planned for two years.
Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell, said the latest figures from the ONS were ""a source of alarm"".
""It's inevitable that more and more people will miss energy, rent and mortgage payments as we get further into winter and the continuing cost of living rises really start to hit more homes,"" she said.
""These figures are the tip of the iceberg and the landscape in April, when we are the other side of the coldest season, will surely look more bleak.""
A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The government's Energy Price Guarantee will save the typical household around £700 this winter, based on what energy prices would have been under the current price cap - reducing bills by roughly a third.
""In addition, we have provided at least an extra £1,200 of cost-of-living support to 8 million of the most vulnerable households.
""We've also reversed the rise in national insurance contributions and made changes to Universal Credit to help working households keep more of what they earn."""	/news/business-63378633
business	Deliveroo riders agree to stop parking on Brentwood High Street	"Deliveroo drivers have agreed to stop parking on a High Street in a council scheme that could be rolled out in other areas.
Brentwood Borough Council in Essex said the town had a problem with vehicles parking illegally on pavements and takeaway food couriers were ""one of the biggest culprits"".
Riders would be allowed 15 minutes of free parking in bays on other streets.
Deliveroo said it had worked with the council on the new parking scheme.
Council leader Chris Hossack told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""There is no denying that most High Streets across the UK have kind of turned into big drive-thrus - whether they be for pizzas or Chinese takeaways.
""But in order to help them we have allocated off-street parking bays in Chatham Way and William Hunter Way where they can pull up and get 15 minutes grace.""
Deliveroo riders would have a parking badge which would stop them getting on-the-spot parking fines in the allocated bays.
uncil's discussions with Deliveroo came as Brentwood's High Street saw more parking fines than any other in Essex, with 3,333 penalty charge notices issued between 1 July 2021 and 30 June 2022, resulting in £80,571 raised from fines.
A Deliveroo spokeswoman said it had worked with the council and did not regard it as a ""ban"".
""The safety of Deliveroo riders and pedestrians is a priority, and we are pleased to be working with the local authority to launch a pilot parking scheme for Deliveroo riders,"" she said.
""This will provide riders with parking guidance and grant them permission to park for free in permitted zones so they can safely collect customer's orders.""
Mr Hossack said: ""We are pioneering a system with Deliveroo - they haven't done it with any other council yet - they are even sharing what we are doing in Brentwood with city councils like Cardiff and Edinburgh.""

business	Vow to tackle long waits to make a complaint	"financial regulator says an overhaul of its rules will tackle some of the biggest frustrations held by consumers.
Under the new Consumer Duty, it should take customers no longer to make a complaint than to be sold a product.
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is updating its rules on the treatment of customers to focus on clarity and value.
It said that should include ending long waits on the phone or rip-off fees.
Sheldon Mills, executive director of consumers and competition at the FCA, said: ""The current economic climate means it's more important than ever that consumers are able to make good financial decisions. The financial services industry needs to give people the support and information they need and put their customers first.""
ges are a complex rewriting of some of the FCA's rules for the 60,000 financial firms it regulates. These cover a range of sectors from banking to insurance, but are yet to include buy now, pay later services and cryptocurrency businesses.
However, at their heart is a requirement that firms provide products that meet their customers' needs, and ensure adequate support is provided as and when people need it.
regulator said financial firms would need to collect, and be judged on, data that includes:
Firms must abide by the rules for new and existing products by the end of July next year but, for older - often more complex - products no longer for sale, the rules will not be fully implemented until the end of July 2024.
""The FCA will likely receive some flak for this decision, especially given much of the worst detriment in terms of things like high charges and poor service often sit squarely with firms no longer actively trying to win new business,"" said Tom Selby, from investment platform AJ Bell.
FCA pointed out that only 30% of people thought financial firms were honest and transparent in how they dealt with their customers.
Mr Mills denied that the new rules were an admission that current regulation failed to keep up with new developments.
He said that the impact of the new Consumer Duty should be felt by consumers through greater confidence that they were being dealt with fairly.
Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: ""Customers should get good service at a fair price. Yet time and time again we see firms overcharging loyal customers, selling poor products and making it tricky for shoppers to make careful, informed decisions. In a fast-changing world, it's harder than ever for regulators to adapt and protect consumers. 
""We support the FCA's Consumer Duty, but the wait for it shouldn't be seen as a green light for firms to play fast and loose with customers while they can.""
Last month, Nausicaa Delfas, the interim chief financial ombudsman, said victims of poor service from financial firms should have problems dealt with speedily, particularly during uncertain economic times."	/news/business-62308181
business	Norwich City 'in talks' with Milwaukee Brewers' owner	"An American multi-millionaire businessman is understood to be in talks with Norwich City about a potential investment in the club.
Mark Attanasio, the owner of Major League Baseball franchise Milwaukee Brewers, attended Sunday's season finale at Carrow Road, as reported in the Pink Un.
Canaries have been relegated from the Premier League to the Championship.
5-0 to Tottenham Hotspur in their last match of the season.
In a recent interview with the club's media team, sporting director Stuart Webber hinted at some ""exciting news"" that supporters would be hearing about soon. 
ub's majority shareholders are chef Delia Smith and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones.
Analysis by Rob Butler, BBC Radio Norfolk
Norwich City supporters have long debated if new financial investment would end the yo-yo existence of a club that just cannot seem to establish itself in the Premier League. They might soon be able to find out. 
fact that Mark Attanasio and his entourage travelled to Carrow Road to watch their final top flight game for some time indicates that this is much more than a passing interest. Current majority shareholders Delia Smith and Michael Wynn-Jones are now both in their 80s and it is clear a succession plan is required as a potential new era arrives at the club. 
In a recent interview recorded with the club's in-house media team, sporting director Stuart Webber hinted at exciting news coming for fans who had to endure a tough campaign for the Canaries. It is fair to guess a cash injection could be that tonic that lifts spirits around Carrow Road. 
Norwich have tried hard to stay in the so-called best league in the world with a ""self-funding"" model, is this set to be abandoned in favour of more traditional approach with a wealthier backer? Time will tell. 
About 200 fans showed their frustration at another relegation after just one season in the top flight by gathering outside the ground on Sunday.
feat was the Canaries' 26th from 38 games.

business	Saudi Aramco: Oil giant tops own record with $48.4bn quarterly profit	"Saudi oil giant Aramco has broken its own record with a $48.4bn (£40bn) profit for the second quarter of 2022.
It is a 90% year-on-year increase and marks the biggest earnings for the world's largest energy exporter since its public listing three years ago.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has seen oil and gas prices skyrocket. 
Russia is one of the world's biggest exporters but Western nations have pledged to curb their dependence on the country for their energy needs.
According to Bloomberg, the Saudi oil giant's figure represents ""the biggest quarterly adjusted profit of any listed company"".
As well as the record profits, the state-owned Saudi energy giant announced it would keep its dividend unchanged at $18.8bn for the third quarter.
mpany said it would keep expanding to satisfy demand.
""While global market volatility and economic uncertainty remain, events during the first half of this year support our view that ongoing investment in our industry is essential both to help ensure markets remain well supplied and to facilitate an orderly energy transition,"" Aramco president and chief executive Amin Nasser said.
""In fact, we expect oil demand to continue to grow for the rest of the decade, despite downward economic pressures on short-term global forecasts,"" he added.
Oil prices were already rising before the Ukraine war as economies started to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and demand outstripped supply.
world's biggest oil producers, including ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP, have all posted huge earnings this year - leading to growing calls on governments to impose a windfall tax amid an alarming rise in living costs.
In June, US President Joe Biden said Exxon had made ""more money than God this year"".
Saudi Arabia is the largest single producer in Opec, a group representing the world's biggest oil producers. 
Last week Opec+ agreed to raise production slightly in an effort to help ease high oil prices. However, the latest production output increase is at a much slower pace than in recent months.

business	Pfizer will not sell drugs for profit in poor nations	"US drugs giant Pfizer has said it will no longer make a profit from selling its patented medicines to 45 of the world's low-income countries. 
Pfizer said the plan includes 23 patented medicines and vaccines which treat infectious and rare inflammatory diseases and certain cancers. 
It said new medicines and vaccines will also be sold at cost.
firm has previously been criticised for making profits from its coronavirus-related vaccines.
Meanwhile, other companies, such as British firm AstraZeneca, US owned Johnson & Johnson chose to price their coronavirus vaccines at cost during the pandemic. 
mic has been lucrative for the company and its revenues last year doubled to $81.3bn (£65.1bn). It made almost $26bn (£21bn) in revenues in the first three months of this year partly from the coronavirus vaccine it developed with Germany's BioNTech pharmaceutical company and its pill to treat the virus.  
It has faced calls from campaigners to share its drug-making technologies to help countries in the global south to manufacture their own vaccines and treatments. 
Pfizer said its vaccine and anti-viral treatment for coronavirus would be included in the plan.
firm said the move would benefit more than a billion people.
""We know there are a number of hurdles that countries have to overcome to gain access to our medicines. That is why we have initially selected five pilot countries to identify and come up with operational solutions and then share those learnings with the remaining countries,"" Angela Hwang, group president of the Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group, said. 
Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said he hoped other firms would follow in their steps. 
""We're pleased to be working with Pfizer and we're talking to the entire pharmaceutical industry about these kinds of initiatives,"" Mr Gates said.
firm faced criticism during the pandemic when, unlike drugmaker AstraZeneca, it continued to sell its covid vaccines for profit. 
Mr Bourla has also appealed to the World Health Organisation and other partners to help with the logistics of prescribing and distributing the drugs.
So far, Rwanda, Ghana, Malawi, Uganda and Senegal have committed to joining the company's ""Accord for a Healthier World"". 
Malawi President Lazarus Chakwera said in a statement the agreement will allow the countries and the firm to share ""the burden of costs and tasks in the production and delivery of supplies that will save millions of lives.""
resident of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, also said he hoped other companies would follow Pfizer's example.

business	Iconic Shanghai sites go dark as drought hits power supply	"An iconic skyline in the Chinese city of Shanghai - called The Bund - will not be lit for two nights to save power, officials say.
waterfront area - known for its mix of historical and futuristic buildings - is a popular tourist destination.
Elsewhere in China, major manufacturers in the Sichuan province told the BBC they had been hit by power cuts.
Large parts of the world's second biggest economy face a severe drought amid a record-breaking heatwave.
In a notice on Sunday, the Shanghai Landscaping and City Appearance Administrative Bureau said buildings in the Bund, which are located along the city's largest river, will not be lit on Monday and Tuesday.
""We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause,"" it said, in the notice.
China issued its first national drought alert of the year last week, after areas including Shanghai in the Yangtze Delta region and Sichuan in southwest China experienced weeks of extreme heat.
'yellow alert' is the third most severe level on the official scale.
Officials in the Sichuan province, where temperatures have exceeded 40C (104F), said in a recent statement that rising temperatures and low rainfall, along with increased demand for air conditioning, had caused the power shortages.
rovince has extended its power saving measures by five days to Thursday, according to media reports. These limit the power supply to some industrial businesses.
German carmaker Volkswagen told the BBC that its factory in Chengdu - which is the capital of Sichuan - remains shut.
A Volkswagen spokesperson said the firm expects ""a slight delay"" in deliveries that it could recover ""in the near future"".
""We are monitoring the situation and are in close exchange with our suppliers,"" the spokesperson added.
Apple supplier Foxconn, which also shut its plant in Sichuan, said the impact on its production was currently ""not significant"".
Meanwhile, Japanese auto giant Toyota told the BBC it was gradually resuming production in Sichuan ""utilising in-house power generation"".
mpact of power cuts are likely to be short-lived, Chenyu Wu, an associate analyst for China and North Asia at consultancy Control Risks, told the BBC.
""Local efforts to save power and boost generation are likely to help mitigate the power shortage situation in the coming weeks, especially if the much-hoped for end to the scorching heat wave arrives,"" he said.
Authorities have moved to induce rainfall in parts of central and southwest China amid a heatwave, which is the longest on record for the country.
Provinces around the drought-stricken Yangtze River - Asia's longest waterway - have turned to cloud seeding operations to combat the lack of rain, while Hubei and a number of other provinces have launched rockets carrying chemicals into the sky, according to local media.
But a lack of cloud cover has stalled efforts in some areas seeking to do the same.

business	South Africa turns to solar to help stop power cuts	"Young engineer Nolwazi Zulu says that when she was a teenager she decided that she would ""go out and do something"" about the regular power cuts that bedevil her community.
Now 25 years old, Ms Zulu is from rural Kwazulu-Natal on the eastern coast of South Africa.
Like the rest of the country her home province has had to endure frequent blackouts, called ""load-shedding"", since 2008. 
used by South Africa's aging, state-owned power grid, and its mainly coal-fuelled power stations, struggling to keep up with demand.
ry to help solve the problem, and boost its environmental credentials, the South African government is now continuing with efforts to boost the amount of solar-power generation in the country. To do this it is encouraging firms in the sector to tender for contracts.
It currently wants to secure an additional 1,000 megawatts from solar power, enough to provide electricity for approximately one million homes in the country. This is in addition to a desire to boost onshore wind power generation by 1,600 megawatts.
Currently only 11% of South Africa's power comes from renewables, and mostly wind. Just 0.9% so far comes from solar, in a country that gets an average eight to 10 hours of sun every day, compared with the UK's four.
One firm that has won one of the solar bids is Art Solar, the only South African-owned solar panel manufacturer. The word Art stands for ""African Renewable Technology"". 
It is at this company that Ms Zulu works in the design team as she continues to study for a diploma in electrical power engineering at the Durban University of Technology.
In addition to helping the national power grid, she says that solar panels can bring power to the many rural homes that aren't connected to the mains.
""I want to open an Art Solar branch in Ulundi [where she grew up], and bring solar to my village,"" says Ms Zulu. ""It is cheaper and better than how we are living through load-shedding, and will change so many lives.""
Durban-based Art Solar started 12 years ago, building solar panels under licence from German firm Bosch. It now manufacturers panels in partnership with fellow German company Talesun for both the South African and international markets.
General manager Viren Gosai says that the government's solar push has given the company the confidence to open a new facility that is capable of producing 650,000 panels per year.
It also supplies private homes and businesses, despite its panels being more expensive than lower-quality imports that don't face any import tariffs.
""Covid-19 and lockdowns were bad in many ways,"" says Mr Gosai. ""But the one positive I noticed is that it made people patriotic.
""People want to buy local, rely on the resources at home, and are loyal.""
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
One high-profile recent contract for Art Solar was providing the solar panels last year for a private hospital in Durban. It means that the Ahmed Al-Kadi Hospital is protected from the risk of power cuts.
Up in East African countries including Tanzania, fellow solar energy firm Zola Electric has a solution to power supply that ignores national grids. Instead of connecting solar panel farms to nationwide power systems, it wants to create independent ""mini-grids"" for villages and other communities.
Zola's chief executive Bill Lenihan says we need to ""move beyond legacy ways of thinking about energy access, especially in Africa"".
He adds that in emerging markets, alongside moving from fossil fuels to renewables, people are thinking that having a single energy grid may not work.
""Everyone in their minds was saying: 'We're going to build a grid.' Well you are not building grids.
""One hundred years later in places like Africa people don't have access to working grids, and they are not going to get working grids, because it is a flawed technology for emerging markets. This isn't controversial to say this any more.""
Back in South Africa, Jay Naidoo, a former government minister under Nelson Mandela, is a fan of the idea of such separate mini-grids for the 20% of South African households not connected to the grid of state energy firm Eskom.
rustee and resident of the Earthrise Trust, an eco-farming project in rural Free State province.
""Our aim is to empower rural communities, particularly women and the youth contributing to economic growth,"" says Mr Naidoo. ""Power though is still an issue, halting the prospects and self-sufficient nature of the farm.
""Imagine if we could have a community-owned, micro-solar grid and meet our own needs? It could electrify so many communities and create community-owned assets.""
South African environmental campaigning organisation Earthlife Africa has been calling for more renewable power in the country for some time.
""We've missed out on investing in solar,"" says Earthlife director Makoma Lekalakala. ""We would be beyond the [power cuts] crisis if we had.""
""Instead we have leaned into the narrative that we have coal, and coal is the baseline.""
South Africa should have moved towards solar ""long ago"", she says, adding: ""We have wasted a lot of time and disregarded the climate commitments we made in international spaces.""
South Africa's Department of Mining Resources and Energy did not respond to a request for a comment.
As Art Solar plans a big increase in production, Ms Zulu says she is thrilled that the company is indeed now planning to open a branch in her local community.
Meanwhile, Mr Gosai says he is confident for the future of solar power in the country. ""The light is amazing in South Africa, a lot of daylight hours means a high return on investment. [And] our people back us."""	/news/business-63741041

New analysis by the BBC data team reveals the big changes to the retail and hospitality sectors across the country since lockdown. 
Scotland-wide, there are now 8% fewer clothes shops but 12% more fast food outlets since 2020. 
And in the city centre of Glasgow there are now more beauty service providers than pubs.  
BBC Data team looked at every town and city across the UK to see how they had changed since March, 2020. 
What emerged in Scotland was a picture of high streets transforming fast - squeezed by the Covid lockdown and the rise in demand for internet shopping and eating out.

raditional retail destinations have suffered the most. Edinburgh's Princes Street lost 27% of its retailers since March 2020, while Clackmannanshire has 9% fewer shops than it did two years ago.
Analysis of Ordnance Survey's Points of Interest mapping data revealed other Scottish findings including:
In positive news for the hospitality sector, Scotland has 936 more more eating and drinking establishments than before the pandemic - the highest increase in the UK - driven by more cafes and fast food outlets. 
But the decline of some parts of this sector is illustrated in the G1 and G2 postcodes of central Glasgow.
Hair and beauty services are now the most common type of shop here - overtaking pubs and bars which were the most prevalent in March 2020.
Ewan MacDonald-Russell, deputy head of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said the Covid lockdown accelerated many of the changes that were already being seen on the high street before the pandemic. 
He said: ""The way that huge change happened, it meant we got about five or six years of change in the space of five or six months.
""The consequence of that is a lot of retailers now operate from fewer shops and where they have shops there is a distinct reason to go to them.
""We have to be careful about phrases like 'death of the high street' because actually it is about the transformation of the high street, retail might not be as big a footprint but hospitality and others will."" 
Like many places in Scotland, Stirling has seen an increased number of 'To Let' signs since the Covid pandemic. 
Retailers in the city say there is a vicious circle of fewer shops resulting in fewer people on the streets.  
Mary Morrow, owner of Blooming Wonderful florists, managed to keep her business going by working from home during the pandemic. But she has not seen the customers return to her shop in the same numbers since. 
She said: ""If you don't have anyone going past then you won't have anyone coming in, the streets are so empty. 
""This time of year a few years ago it would be buzzing. There would be people in the shop, it would be busy, but there is just not the footfall now. 
""It is the price of the units, people can't afford the rent - reduce the price of the units and get more people in.""
Josine Atsma, owner of the Stirling Health Food Store, ramped up her online presence during lockdown and says it can now account for 50% of her sales some days. 
She said: ""It is the main reason why we are still here, I dare say. 
""There are fewer people coming in and people are spending less. 
""I try to be friendly and know my customers. Also, you don't need to only buy from Amazon if you are buying online, independents are on there too.""

It came as the Microsoft co-founder announced he would make a $20bn (£17bn) donation to his philanthropic fund.
world's fourth richest man said he had an ""obligation"" to return his resources to society. 
Mr Gates first pledged to give away his wealth in 2010 but his net worth has more than doubled since then.
He is currently worth $118bn, according to Forbes magazine, but that will fall significantly after his donation in July to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the charitable fund he set up with his ex-wife in 2000.
In a Twitter thread, Mr Gates said the foundation would boost its spending from $6bn a year to $9bn by 2026 due to recent ""global setbacks"" including the pandemic, Ukraine and the climate crisis.
""As I look to the future, I plan to give virtually all of my wealth to the foundation,"" he said. ""I will move down and eventually off of the list of the world's richest people. 
""I have an obligation to return my resources to society in ways that have the greatest impact for reducing suffering and improving lives. And I hope others in positions of great wealth and privilege will step up in this moment too.""
Gates Foundation works in countries to eradicate diseases such as Malaria, improve education and tackle poor sanitation. It was thought to be the world's second largest charitable foundation in 2020, holding $49.8bn in assets and is backed by other wealthy benefactors such as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett. 
Although the foundation has done good work, some have raised concerns about the ethics of a private endeavour wielding such great influence.
foundation is the largest private donor to the World Health Organization, second only to the US with its annual donation in 2018. Concerns about this became more pointed after former President Donald Trump threatened to pull US funding.

business	Furniture firm Made collapse: Customers in the dark over refunds	"Online furniture firm Made.com has gone into administration, leading to hundreds of job losses and leaving customers in the dark over refunds.
ministrators PWC said there will be 399 job losses, mostly redundancies.
firm's collapse leaves thousands of customers facing uncertainty over outstanding furniture orders.
Around 12,000 UK orders are outstanding and customers will not get a refund from the firm, but may be able to claim one from their bank or card provider.
Next is buying Made's brand name, website and intellectual property for £3.4m, although it will not be buying the remaining stock.
Natalie, 38, from County Antrim, was waiting for a £1,800 refund from Made.com when she received news that the firm had collapsed.
""I ordered a left-hand version of a sofa. Instead, I received two parts of the wrong sofa, which didn't even fit together!"", said Natalie.
She has appealed to her lender to ask if they can help and has had to order another sofa in the meantime.
UK and European customer orders currently with delivery companies will be fulfilled. But orders which have been paid for but not yet dispatched will not be refunded or delivered.
Lisa Webb, consumer rights expert at Which?, said for customers with outstanding orders, exercising their rights is not always straightforward.
""It is always worth trying to claim for a refund in this situation, but customers should know it is not guaranteed,"" she said.
She pointed out that if customers bought an item costing more than £100 on their credit card, that card provider is jointly responsible. 
In that case, consumers can claim under Section 75 if an item is faulty or not delivered, and if it cost less than £100 and a credit or debit card was used, they might be able to claim the amount back via a chargeback through their bank.
Sarah, 46, from York, told the BBC that she has been waiting for 14 weeks for a sofa bed that has not yet arrived.
After paying £270 and receiving a notification that the item had been shipped, she says she has not heard from the company.
Sarah described her ""disappointment"" about not receiving the product, as well as the fact she heard more about the company's collapse on social media than from Made itself.
f executive of Made, Nicola Thompson, apologised to everyone affected by the business going into administration, adding that the firm had ""fought tooth and nail"" to avoid this outcome.
She described Made.com as a ""much-loved brand"" that had thrived in a world of lower prices, stable demand from its customers and reliable supply chains.
But she continued: ""That world vanished, the business could not survive in its current iteration, and we could not pivot fast enough. The brand will now continue under new owners.""
It is a dramatic change in fortunes for the brand, which boomed during the pandemic-related lockdowns as people bought more furniture and other products online.
retailer, which sourced furniture directly from designers and manufacturers, gained a loyal base of mostly younger customers. Last year, it was valued at £775m after floating on the London Stock Exchange.
But more recently the company hit problems, as households cut back on big-ticket purchases. Global supply chain issues have also left customers waiting months for deliveries.
Made.com had already halted new orders recently and said it is currently not offering refunds or accepting returns from customers, although it is still intending to fulfil some previous orders.
Made.com announced its intention to appoint administrators last week. It had originally hoped to find a buyer for the whole business.
However, the company's co-founder and former boss wrote in a LinkedIn post that his offer to buy the furniture business was rejected.
Ning Li said he had offered to buy Made with his own cash, saving about 100 jobs, but this ""wasn't accepted"".

business	Luton Airport: Passenger numbers top 1.2m in April	"New jobs are expected at Luton Airport where managers are expecting the ""busiest summer since 2019"".
Bedfordshire airport had 1.2m passengers pass through its gates in April compared with 106,000 in April 2021.
Alberto Martin, chief executive at Luton London Airport (LLA), said the figures demonstrated its ""continued recovery"".
rport is owned by Luton Rising, a company owned by Luton Borough Council.
Mr Martin, said: ""The launch of new destinations and the opening of new shops and restaurants, along with a great customer experience are a clear signal that LLA is truly back in business and positions us as the airport of choice for people travelling this summer.""
rport, which is the UK's fifth busiest, said in ""preparation for its busiest summer since 2019"" it was looking to recruit staff in a number of jobs including security, retail customer service and hospitality, and positions to work on the Direct Air-Rail Transit (DART) system, that will link the airport terminal with Luton Airport Parkway railway station.

business	Norwich to Tilbury National Grid pylon consultation has 'legal deficiencies'	"A consultation document for plans to build high voltage electricity pylons through Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex needs to be rewritten to include other options, a barrister has said.
112 mile-long (180km) power line would run from Norwich, in Norfolk, to Tilbury, in Essex.
Charles Banner QC said there were ""legal deficiencies"" with the consultation.
National Grid said it was ""listening carefully to the views"" of the public.
It said it felt the proposals met its regulatory obligations to the government, which has a target to connect up to 50 GW of offshore wind by 2030.
Meanwhile, South Norfolk Council accused National Grid of acting like ""no-one lives in Norfolk"".
Councillors said the utilities company had failed to provide enough information about its proposals to locals.
It comes after Norfolk County Council announced it was against the scheme, which has also faced opposition from three Suffolk councils, six East Anglian MPs and campaign groups.
Mr Banner, a barrister employed by campaigners against the plans, said: ""The lay public consultees have not been provided with anything approaching a sufficient level of information to enable them to make an intelligent comparison of the environmental impacts of the preferred option compared to options which involve no, or considerably fewer, pylons.""
He added: ""If left uncorrected these legal deficiencies will infect the later statutory consultation.""
re part of a proposed 400kV electricity transmission line between Norwich and a new Bramford substation near Ipswich, and then to Tilbury in south Essex, called the East Anglia Green Energy Enablement project.
National Grid said the line was needed to carry electricity from offshore wind turbines.
It has proposed to run the cables underground through the Dedham Vale area of outstanding natural beauty on the Essex/Suffolk border, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
ree Essex councils - the county council, Braintree District and Brentwood Borough - have this week also indicated their opposition to a new power line that would cut through countryside in their districts.
Lesley Wagland OBE, Essex County Council cabinet member for infrastructure, said: ""We believe that new offshore generated electricity should be transmitted offshore, which is why we need an offshore grid.
""Such an alternative approach could avoid all the physical constraints of an above or below-ground solution.""
National Grid said it would take people's comments into consideration as it developed the proposals, and there would be another opportunity to comment on the proposals before an application is submitted to the Planning Inspectorate in late 2024.

business	Nottingham Castle Christmas traders relieved at relocation	"Christmas market traders affected by the sudden closure of Nottingham Castle have said they are relieved the event has been relocated.
rust that runs the attraction went into liquidation on Monday, meaning it closed and a market, due to take place at the weekend, was cancelled.
Business Improvement District (BID) has said the market will now take place in Sneinton.
Nottingham Castle Trust said it was ""hugely disappointed"" to be closing.
Christmas craft market was due to take place in the castle's grounds from Friday to Sunday.
raders said they feared they would have lost thousands of pounds as a result of the cancellation.
However Nottingham BID said it had worked with partners to offer the 23 traders who had been due to attend the market a new location on Sneinton Market Avenues.
Dr Rose Deakin, founder of The Crop Club, a Gedling-based business selling eco-growing kits, said: ""I am blown away by how quickly the community rallied around to create an alternative.
""Thank you to everyone that has helped make this new location a possibility.""
Heidi Hargreaves, co-owner of Dukki which specialises in regional dialect gifts and homeware, said cancelling the market completely would have been a ""huge blow financially"".
""The only good thing to come from this is the strength and resilience of all the small businesses,"" she said.
""Even though we largely work alone in our day-to-day lives, when there is a crisis we pull together and form a community of like-minded individuals.""
Julie Jackson, owner of Sustainable Bags and Fashion, which sells recycled bags and accessories from leather destined for landfill, said she felt lucky Sneinton Market Avenues had offered to host the event at short notice.
""It's such a lovely gesture to do for us all,"" the 49-year-old said. ""We appreciate it.
""This has really helped us out as we rely on trading at these events and it's tough being a small business in the current climate.""
Alex Flint, CEO of Nottingham BID, said: ""On hearing the news about Nottingham Castle, we knew decisions needed to be made to enable the diverse range of local food retailers and makers to continue to trade.
""We have collectively secured a new event venue at Sneinton Market Avenues.""

business	Grocery bills forecast to rise by £12 a week on average	"rage annual grocery bill across Great Britain is forecast to rise by £643 this year, according to research firm Kantar.
means shoppers could be paying on average an extra £12 a week for food and other groceries.
Back in June, the firm predicted the cost of the average annual supermarket shop would go up by £380 in 2022.
Food prices have soared this year, with the war in Ukraine helping to drive up prices at supermarket tills.
urvey also showed the price of a weekly shop rose 13.9% in September, compared with the year before. That marks another record high since Kantar first started tracking the sector in 2008.
""The cost-of-living crisis is still hitting people hard at the checkouts and this latest data will make tough reading for many,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.
""Based on our numbers, the average household is facing a £643 jump in their annual grocery bill to £5,265 if they continue to buy the same items. Taking that at a basket level, that's an extra £3.04 on top of the cost of the average shopping trip last year which was £21.89.""
However, the firm also said that people are looking for ways to manage their budgets to avoid paying more for their shopping, amid soaring living costs.
Sales of supermarket own-label products continue to grow as customers switch from branded products.
Inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - is currently near a 40-year high, at 9.9%.
Increasing costs are eating into household budgets, with new figures on Tuesday showing rises in regular wages are failing to keep up with the rising cost of living.
Food prices went up around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills.
war has disrupted supplies from the two countries, which are major exporters of goods such as sunflower oil, wheat and fertiliser.
Kantar said grocery inflation now stands at 12.3% for the 12-week period ending 2 October. Items such as milk, margarine and dog food are seeing the fastest price rises.
However, there isn't strong evidence of diets changing despite rising prices, Mr McKevitt said.
""We're generally reluctant to change what we eat, so this is more about sticking to the food we know and love while hunting for cheaper alternatives,"" he said.
""For example, while frozen veg sales have gone up slightly, there hasn't been a big switch away from fresh products, which are still worth 10 times more.""
ut exception to this was a surge in marmalade sales, which were up by 18% in September as the country commemorated the death of Queen Elizabeth II.
Shoppers are also hunting out products to help manage their energy bills, the data suggests.
Energy bills rose for millions of households on 1 October, although the increase was cushioned by a government cap on the cost per unit as well as cost-of-living payments.
A typical household annual bill rose from £1,971 to £2,500 - which is twice as high as last winter.
Sales of cooking appliances including slow cookers, air fryers and sandwich makers, which tend to use less energy, rose by 53%, suggesting people are searching out cheaper ways to cook as they try to avoid using their ovens.
Meanwhile, sales of duvets and electric blankets grew by 8%, while candles are up by 9%, suggesting that people may be preparing for possible winter blackouts.
report by Kantar also showed that the discounters are once again the fastest growing grocers.
Lidl's sales were up 21% over the last 12 weeks, closely followed by Aldi.
Asda was the best performing of the traditional big supermarkets, with its new Just Essentials basic range helping to boost sales. "	/news/business-63212669
business	Cost of living: New Zealand steps up fight against soaring prices	"New Zealand's central bank has stepped up its fight against soaring prices, raising its key interest rate to the highest level in over 13 years.
Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) increased its key rate of interest by 0.75 percentage points to 4.25%.
was the biggest rise since the rate, known as the official cash rate, was introduced in 1999.
It comes after the country's annual inflation rate stood at 7.2% in the three months to the end of September.
Like much of the rest of the world, New Zealand has seen the cost of living rise sharply as the global economy emerges from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine has pushed up the cost of fuel and food.
RBNZ's updated forecasts also pointed to the country's economy falling into recession in September next year. A recession is usually defined as when an economy shrinks for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row.
""Because the New Zealand economy is starting from a position of very high inflation and acute labour shortages, an economic contraction is likely,"" the RBNZ said in a statement.
""Trying to avoid an economic contraction by limiting any interest rate increases in the near term would likely lead to a longer period of high inflation. In turn, this would likely result in higher interest rates and a larger contraction eventually being required to bring inflation and employment back to a more sustainable path,"" it added.
Economists at the bank ANZ welcomed the move.
""Hope is not a strategy. The RBNZ Monetary Policy Committee gets that, and deserves a pat on the back for facing the challenges head-on. If the facts change, they'll change their minds. But right now, the fact is that high inflation is looking increasingly entrenched, and dithering would only make the problem worse,"" ANZ Research said in a note to investors.
During a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday, New Zealand's Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the world economy faced a ""year of reckoning"" in 2023.
""Countries will either be in recession or feel like they are,"" Mr Robertson added.
After the RBNZ interest rate announcement, the New Zealand dollar hit a three month high against the US dollar before easing a little.

business	California says Amazon's dominance drives up online prices	"f California has accused Amazon of violating competition law with practices that prevent sellers from offering lower prices elsewhere.
wsuit from America's most populous state says the moves have hurt rivals and made online shopping more expensive for everyone.
It marks the biggest legal threat Amazon has faced in the US. 
But a similar lawsuit was dismissed in the US earlier this year for insufficient evidence of higher prices.
Proving harm to consumers in the form of higher prices is a key issue in US competition law. 
Amazon said that like the DC case, California's complaint had it ""exactly backwards"" and that the lawsuit should be dismissed.
""Sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store,"" the company said. ""Amazon takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices across the broadest selection, and like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively.""
In the complaint, California says Amazon's contracts require sellers to offer the lowest price on Amazon, restraining the ability of other websites to compete. 
By protecting Amazon's dominance of the market, the deals give the firm freedom to raise fees on merchants, which eventually hit consumers in the form of higher prices.
""Amazon knows its price parity agreements prevent rivals from stealing market share away with lower prices reflective of their lower fees. So Amazon keeps raising fees, leading to higher prices on Amazon, leading to higher prices off Amazon due to price parity,"" the lawsuit says.
It said this created ""a vicious anticompetitive cycle in which Amazon wins and its third-party sellers, its wholesale suppliers, consumers, and competition lose"".
wsuit also accuses Amazon of punishing merchants who run afoul of the rules, with tactics such as moving their listings lower in search results,
""The reality is: Many of the products we buy online would be cheaper if market forces were left unconstrained,"" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.
ugh the lawsuit is limited to California, its effect could be far-reaching given California's size. 
wsuit comes as regulators, especially in the European Union, increasingly question the dominance of a handful tech giants.
ummer Amazon sought to settle a case brought by the EU which accused it of using data it collects on sellers to compete against them. 
Amazon is also under investigation in the UK over concerns that the company is giving an unfair advantage to certain sellers on its marketplace.
Meanwhile an EU court this week also largely upheld a record fine against Google for using the Android platform to cement its search engine's dominance."	/news/business-62908412
business	Gloucestershire firms raising prices due to inflation	"Food and drink businesses say they have to increase prices due to the cost of living crisis.
Greg Pilley, founder of the Stroud Brewery & Taproom in Gloucestershire, said his business is facing a 10% rise in costs.
means a price increase of ""between 25 and 30 to 40p per pint"".
Other businesses in the county say they are having to reluctantly pass on rising costs to their customers in the form of higher prices.
UK is seeing its highest inflation in 41 years, with energy bills and the cost of food and drink the main drivers.
Milk prices were one of the biggest risers in latest food inflation figures, but producers say this does not always benefit them.
Richard Cornock, a Gloucestershire dairy farmer, said the price he gets for milk is determined by his major buyer. 
At the same time, he says he is having to absorb higher diesel and fertiliser prices.
""I can't go to [my milk buyer] and say I need another 5p a litre because they'll just go, ""well, we haven't budgeted for that"","" he said.
Neville Morse, who owns Jane's Pantry café in Gloucester, said they have had to put prices up twice this year - instead of just once in April, like they usually would.
""Our energy costs have doubled in this one shop alone, from £4,500 a month to £9,000,"" said Mr Morse.
""Across our 11 shops and the factory, we have to find an extra £400,000 in total this year. We don't want to raise prices for our customers but we have no choice.""
One item on the bakery shelf illustrates that rise in food prices: last year, the rum truffle was £1.80, now it costs £2.20.

business	Energy fears drive blankets and air fryers sales ahead of winter	"People are stocking up on blankets and air fryers as they try to keep their energy bills down this winter, according to a new report.
Other energy-efficient appliances, such as air dryers, and warm clothing have also been selling well, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.
But despite this, overall retail sales volumes continued to fall in September, the BRC said.
It said people have been avoiding buying items such as TVs and computers.
report, from the BRC and consultancy KPMG, showed the value of retail sales grew by 2.2% last month, an increase from the 1% growth seen in August.
However, the slight rise in sales masks a much bigger fall in the volume of goods sold, once inflation is accounted for, the BRC said.
Inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - is currently near a 40-year high, at 9.9%.
""While UK retail sales grew in September, this represented another month of falling sales volumes given high levels of inflation,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium.
""As consumer confidence continued to fall, people shopped cautiously, avoiding large ticket items such as new computers, TVs and furniture,"" she said.
""Many households are also preparing for higher energy costs this winter, with blankets, warm clothing, and energy-efficient appliances, such as air dryers and air fryers, all selling well.""
Energy bills rose for millions of households on 1 October, although the increase was cushioned by a government cap on the cost per unit.
A typical household annual bill has gone up from £1,971 to £2,500 and there are some further cost-of-living payments to help soften the impact.
But prices are still twice as high as last winter.
Elsewhere, the BRC report shows that food sales rose by 4.6% over the three months to September, compared with the same period in 2021.
Non-food sales slipped by 0.4% over the quarter but rose over the month of September, helped by clothing sales.
""Once again, clothing and footwear came to the rescue of the High Street, and back-to-school purchasing was a driver in retail growth figures, with sales of children's shoes up over 15%,"" said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG.
""Sales of household appliances and cooking accessories also moved into positive territory this month, as consumers look to purchase more energy efficient kitchen items in light of rising energy prices.""
Ms Dickinson warned the winter ahead would be tough for retailers as well as consumers.
""Costs are increasing throughout retailers' supply chain, the pound remains weak, interest rates are rising, and a tight labour market is pushing up the cost of hiring,"" she said.
""All of this is making it harder for retailers to reduce prices and help struggling households.""
A separate report from Barclaycard further illustrated the pressures on households, as cost of living concerns bite.
figures showed consumer card spending rose 1.8% year-on-year in September, the smallest uplift since February 2021.
Spending on essential items saw its weakest rise this year, with growth slowing on fuel and groceries.
However, Barclaycard said that categories such as takeaways and digital content benefited from the arrival of colder weather, which has prompted people to spend more time at home.
""Consumers are taking a savvy approach to budgeting as they reduce spending on discretionary items and seek more value in their weekly shop, which is having a knock-on effect on retail and hospitality sectors,"" said Esme Harwood, director at Barclaycard.
""However, Brits are also looking for ways to enjoy themselves at home while saving money, which has led to growth across ""insperience"" categories such as digital subscriptions and takeaways.
""It is likely to remain a challenging time for many other sectors as consumers focus on essential spending and businesses continue to navigate inflationary headwinds."""	/news/business-63202826
business	Sliding yen: What is happening to the Japanese currency?	"At the end of the last century, Japan became the first major economy to cut interest rates to zero. 
During the Covid pandemic, many other nations adopted that tactic to support their economies. 
untries are now raising interest rates but the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Friday yet again kept its main rate below zero. And that is bad for its currency. 
g been seen as a safe haven, which investors traditionally bought at times of crisis.
But that status is now on shaky ground. This year alone it has lost more than a fifth of its value against the US dollar to hit the lowest level since 1990.
's slide has been driven by the difference between interest rates in Japan and the US.
Since March, the US Federal Reserve has aggressively raised its main interest rate - from 0.25% to 3.25% - as it tries to tackle the rising cost of living.
Higher interest rates tend to make a currency more attractive to investors.
As a result there is less demand for currencies from countries with lower rates and those currencies fall in value.
However, some experts believe the weak yen reflects the state of the country's finances.
my has hardly grown in the last three decades. It is also the world's most indebted nation.
Japan also faced the demographic time bomb of a low birth rate and a population with the highest proportion of older people in the world.
government has allowed some foreign workers to help address the issue but there is still strong opposition to immigration.
""There is no reason for the yen to strengthen,"" says Takeshi Fujimaki, a former adviser to billionaire investor George Soros.
He expects the Japanese currency to hit 180 against the US dollar before eventually collapsing in value, as he has previously warned.
BOJ governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has repeatedly said the economy is too weak to handle higher interest rates.
Like much of the rest of the world, Japanese consumers are struggling with rising inflation but that has been welcomed by policy makers, who have long wanted prices to rise.
Mr Kuroda says the bank's current policy is necessary to help it reach its 2% inflation target.
use for years Japan has faced deflation, or falling prices, which is bad for an economy because when prices keep dropping, consumers tend to hold back on buying big ticket items as they expect them to be cheaper in the future.
Japan had not intervened in the global currency market to prop up the yen for almost two and a half decades.
Last month though, as the currency fell, authorities stepped in, spending $21bn (£18.3bn).
It helped for a short time but soon the currency tumbled again, this time crossing 150 yen to the dollar.
reportedly triggered fresh intervention, this time with an estimated $37bn.
Japanese government has so far refused to confirm it stepped in again, even as traders said they saw signs of another intervention earlier this week.
Experts have warned that these attempts to prop up the yen will only ever have a short term effect.
""It is to show the position of the Japanese government that it doesn't want any further weakening of Japanese yen,"" Eisuke Sakakibara, a former senior official at Japan's finance ministry said.
weak yen makes everything Japan buys more expensive.
untry relies heavily on imported oil and gas. Because of exchange rates and rising energy prices, the amount of money it spent on imports last month jumped by 46%.
But it is not all bad news for businesses. The money made abroad by Japanese exporters is worth a lot more back home. As exports account for about 15% of the country's total economic activity, that is not insignificant.
However, Japan's consumers have seen their purchasing power halved over the last decade. Ten years ago, 10,000 yen would buy an item worth $132, but today it only gets you something worth $67.
major problem because average salaries in Japan have hardly risen in over three decades.
ue is even more acute when people need to use the yen to pay for things overseas, for example when they travel or their children study abroad.
When the yen started to fall in value Japan's borders were still shut so people did not feel much of an effect.
However, now that Japan has started to allow visitors in the currency's sliding value makes the country more attractive to tourists, as their holiday money goes further.
In 2019, Japan welcomed 32 million foreign visitors, who spent about 5 trillion yen ($33.6bn; £29.7bn).
While tourist numbers are still a long way from that level, investment bank Goldman Sachs has predicted inbound spending could reach 6.6tn yen within a year of the country fully reopening."	/news/business-63335371
business	China congress: Beijing delays key economic figures as leaders meet	"China has delayed the release of its latest economic growth figures, which were due to be published as the Communist Party's leadership gathers.
President Xi Jinping is expected to be confirmed for a historic third-term at this week's party congress in Beijing.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) did not give a reason for the delay.
ribed as ""very rare"" by experts and is seen by some as a sign of further weakness in the world's second largest economy.
However, Zhao Chenxin, deputy head of China's National Development and Reform Commission, said on Monday that the country's economy had ""picked up significantly in the third quarter"".
""Globally China's economic performance also remains outstanding. Consumer prices have risen modestly, in sharp contrast to the high global inflation, and employment remained generally stable,"" he told a news conference.
According to an updated NBS calendar, publication of several key economic indictors on Tuesday, including third quarter gross domestic product (GDP), had been ""postponed"".
A new date for the release of the figures has yet to be scheduled.
NBS did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.
Pushan Dutt, an economics professor at INSEAD, told the BBC the delay was a ""very rare event"" as the Chinese government had released data as scheduled through the pandemic.
""My only guess is that those numbers were not very good and would not lead to the objective of doubling the Chinese economy in the timespan that President Xi announced,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, believes ""the delay may not necessarily be because of disappointing economic data"".
""The normal procedure of signing off those data might have been disrupted as all top leadership are occupied with the congress,"" she said.
Mr Xi signalled on Sunday that there would be no immediate loosening of his controversial zero-Covid strategy, which has weighed on China's economic growth.
GDP measures the size of an economy. Gauging its expansion or contraction is one of the most important ways of measuring how well or badly an economy is performing and is closely watched by economists and central banks.
China previously indicated that it may miss its annual economic growth target of 5.5%.
Politburo - the ruling Communist Party's top policy-making body - did not mention the official growth target in a statement after its quarterly policy meeting in July. Instead it said it aimed to keep growth within ""a reasonable range"".
Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING Bank, said she expects that China's third-quarter GDP data would ""not paint an optimistic picture"".
""This data delay shows that the government thinks that 20th Party Congress is the most important thing happening in China, and would like to avoid other information that could create mixed messages to the market,"" she told the BBC.

rage monthly mortgage bill would go up from £750 to £1,000, the Bank's Financial Stability Report said.
rising cost would cause severe financial difficulties for another 220,000 households, the Bank said.
Businesses would also be under ""significant pressure"" owing to rising prices and borrowing costs, it added.
""Falling real incomes, increase in mortgage costs and higher unemployment will place significant pressure on household finances and weigh on their ability to service debt,"" Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said in a letter to the Treasury.
Bank also warned of an increased danger of  global financial risks. However, it said that households, businesses and banks were more resilient than before the global financial crisis of 2008 and the recession of the 1990s.
Fixed-rate mortgage deals have a set interest rate during the term of the deal. Most run for two or five years, but longer deals are available. 
Anyone coming to the end of their fixed-rate deal and looking for a new one, or first-time buyers taking out their first mortgage, have seen these loans become much more expensive than they had probably expected or planned for. 
Rates on new fixed-rate deals have climbed throughout this year, as the Bank put up interest rates to fight inflation, but they shot up following the mini-budget, peaking at 6.65%.
However, they stabilised then fell slightly in the run-up to, and after, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement which calmed the markets and, in turn, eased uncertainty for lenders and borrowers.
Variable or tracker rate mortgages can change at any time, usually in response to decisions made by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee on the benchmark Bank rate.
rough the different forms of home loan, an estimated four million households would see their mortgage costs rise next year, the Bank said.
A further two million would see higher costs by 2025, adding to headwinds facing the housing market. Within three years, 70% of mortgage holders would see their payments increase.
Meanwhile, property prices have fallen for three months, the sharpest downturn since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.
Bank said buy-to-let investors were particularly vulnerable, as about 85% of mortgages to landlords were interest only, making them highly sensitive to rising borrowing costs.
It warned that landlords would either raise rents for tenants or sell off their properties, causing a deeper fall in house prices.
""Were landlords to seek to offset the projected rise in buy-to-let mortgage costs, it was estimated they would need to increase their rental income by around 20%,"" the Bank's report said. ""This would increase the cost of housing for renters."""	/news/business-63961179
business	Taxing electric cars 'short-sighted' say manufacturers	"Car makers have expressed dismay over plans to make electric cars subject to vehicle excise duty, in line with petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles.
x will apply from April 2025, the chancellor said in his Autumn Statement.
Nissan, which makes several electric models, said it was concerned about the potential impact on sales of the new tax.
m Slatter, the UK chairman of Ford, described the move as ""short-sighted"".
""We are still many years from the 'tipping point' when electric vehicles will reach cost parity with petrol and diesel vehicles. Until then, we should be incentivising customers to make the greener choice,"" he said.
Electric vehicles registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of vehicle excise duty (VED) in the first year, then move to the standard VED rate, currently £165. Those registered from April 2017 will also pay the standard rate.
In his Autumn statement, the chancellor said half of all new vehicles would be electric by 2025 and the decision was designed ""to make our motoring tax system fairer"". 
A spokesperson from Nissan told the BBC: ""We're concerned about the effect that withdrawing this customer incentive could have on the electric car market, just as it is accelerating.""
firm said it would continue to work with the government to tackle ""the main barriers to the electric vehicle transition, including public charging and measures to continue to support the purchase of EVs"".
r so far, 195,547 battery electric vehicles have been registered in the UK, but they still made up less than 15% of all registrations - according to the SMMT, the UK car manufacturers' trade body.
Sales are expected to continue to rise. From 2030 the sale of new purely petrol and diesel cars will be banned in the UK. 
Kia said electric vehicles had made up more than 16% of its total UK sales so far this year. 
firm's spokesperson said the government decision to extend the tax to electric vehicles, while pushing for their accelerated rollout, was ""at odds with the country's net-zero ambitions"".
In the Autumn Statement the chancellor also announced that electric cars would no longer be exempt from the expensive car supplement. The supplement of £355 is charged every year from the second to sixth year of registration for vehicles priced at more than £40,000.
SMMT described this as the ""sting in the tail"", warning it would unduly penalise new, more expensive vehicle technologies.
SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes called for a ""framework that encourages consumers and businesses to buy electric vehicles"".
Edmund King, AA president, said his organisation understood electric cars would need to be taxed, but said the measures in the Autumn Statement would ""slow the road to electrification"" and ""dim the incentive to switch"".
RAC disagreed, saying it was ""probably fair the government gets owners of electric vehicles to start contributing to the upkeep of major roads from 2025"". The RAC doesn't expect the move to dampen demand, given the ""many other cost benefits"" of running electric vehicles.
In June the government announced it was closing the plug-in grant scheme, which subsidised electric vehicle sales, to new orders, saying it had already helped boost uptake.
In February a group of MPs urged the government to consider a ""pay-per-mile"" scheme to replace current motoring taxes, as the country moves away from petrol and diesel vehicles.

business	JD Sports loses millions in forced Footasylum sale	"Sportswear chain JD Sports has lost millions of pounds after being forced to sell Footasylum, three tumultuous years after buying the retailer.
JD Sports has offloaded Footasylum for £37.5m, far less than the £90m price it paid in 2019. 
JD Sports was forced to sell the business after the takeover was blocked by the UK's competition watchdog. 
It is being bought by private equity firm Aurelius, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy.
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had ruled the merger could lead to less choice and a ""worse deal"" for customers. 
Earlier this year JD Sports and Footasylum were fined almost £4.7m by the CMA for sharing commercially sensitive information during its investigation. The boss of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, resigned from the company in May after the fine. 
JD admitted ""inadvertently"" breaking the rules over the sharing of commercially sensitive information. 
However, it has described the decision to block the takeover as ""inexplicable"". 
In July 2021 Mr Cowgill was filmed meeting his counterpart at Footasylum, Barry Brown, at a car park near Bury in Greater Manchester, first revealed by in a report in the Sunday Times. 
CMA found that during two meetings on 5 July and 4 August 2021 the two bosses had exchanged commercially sensitive information and then failed to alert the regulator. 
It said neither men could provide documentation around the meetings, with ""no notes, no agendas, no emails and poor phone records, some of which were deleted before they could be given to the CMA"".
JD denied phone records had been deliberately deleted and accused the regulator of ""inflammatory language"". 
JD has around 3,400 stores across 29 countries, including 700 in the UK and Ireland, selling brands such as Nike, Adidas and Puma. 
Footasylum, which has more than 65 stores across the UK, sells similar sportswear brands. 
However, announcing the merger in 2019, JD said the two businesses would complement each other because its target audience is slightly younger than Footasylum's focus on 16 to 24-year-olds.

business	Ministers to meet energy giants over cost of living	"Martin Lewis: Rising prices are a crisis on a scale with the pandemic
Ministers will hold talks with energy giants on Thursday to discuss measures to ease the cost of living.
government says talks will focus on how energy companies can alleviate pressure on consumers.
But Treasury officials have stressed that any big decisions will be decided by the next prime minister, when they take office in early September.
Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he would make sure options and ideas were in place for the new PM.
Concerns over what will happen this winter come as figures suggest many households are already in energy debt.
Conservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak said he would be ""happy"" to meet his rival Liz Truss to agree emergency support ahead of the winter.
Ms Truss has dismissed the proposal telling reporters ""now is not the time to pre-empt those decisions"".
Yet new figures from comparison service Uswitch laid bare the challenge facing Mr Johnson's successor.
Almost a quarter of households owe £206 to energy firms, on average, with the total debt owed by the public triple that of September last year, according to a survey of 2,000 households.
Forecasts predict average annual energy bills could rise to over £4,200 by January - while the state pension is typically worth between £7,376 and £9,628.
Mr Johnson has faced growing criticism for not announcing further support beyond the £15bn package set out in May, while the government is under pressure to do more to help with bills.
Mr Zahawi said he was focused on ensuring that the money the government had already promised was getting ""into people's bank accounts"". 
He added that he would make sure ""we have the ideas and the options available to whoever becomes prime minister on the 5 September"".
But consumer expert Martin Lewis has called on what he described as the ""zombie"" government to ""wake up"" and put together a plan immediately.
Speaking to the BBC, he compared the current situation to the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are currently in that position of watching the beds in European hospitals and doing nothing about it,"" he said. 
On Wednesday morning, Ms Truss did not rule out making cash payments to help people with energy bills but said her priority would be to reverse April's National Insurance rise and temporarily drop green levies on energy bills arguing that low taxes were ""vitally important"" for growing the economy.
She also said she would boost energy supply by ""getting more gas out of the North Sea"" and allowing more fracking to take place. 
Analysis by Rajdeep Sandhu, BBC political correspondent
Liz Truss is trying to appeal to two different electorates at the same time. 
first and arguably most important (right now) is the Conservative membership. Her message of tax cuts seems to be going down well with the people who will decide the next prime minister. 
But she'll also have one eye on the future electorate she might one day face - the general public and those voters who gave the Conservatives a chance last time and might not give them a second one if they are struggling with day-to-day costs. That might explain why Liz Truss's language has been very careful in recent days. 
Because while she is convinced tax cuts are the way to help the economy grow, she isn't categorically ruling out direct support to those who are vulnerable. 
She's left herself enough room to change her mind in the future if she does become prime minister and the growing calls for financial help become deafening. 
Liberal Democrats have argued that the energy profits levy - or windfall tax - should be backdated to October 2021 and the extra money raised should be used to help people with energy bills. 
A windfall tax is a one-off charge imposed by a government on a company, designed to target firms that have benefited from circumstances they were not responsible for.
Companies supplying energy are getting much more money for their oil and gas than they were last year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the pandemic, but more recently because of supply constraints following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
- which the Treasury previously said could raise up to £5bn - came into effect on 26 May. Energy firms like BP have reported recorded quarterly profits this year that will not be impacted by the levy.
Asked about backdating the windfall tax, Ms Truss replied: ""The answer to our problems is not more taxes."" 
Speaking at a leadership hustings, former Chancellor Mr Sunak warned that the Conservative Party would be ""hammered"" at the next election without offering further direct support to households.
Labour's Bridget Philipson says the party has been ""consistently ahead of the government"" on energy bills
He has not set out in detail what further payments he would make to households, saying the exact scale of the rise is still unclear, and any payments would come on top of existing support.
Labour's shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC Breakfast the situation was ""deeply worrying"" and said Labour would cut VAT on gas and electricity bills.
She also said her party would set out further proposals ""very soon"" but added that they ""wouldn't have let things get to this point in the first place""."	/news/uk-politics-62486509

It is understood the service is likely to apply to homes which have smart meters installed.
re are hopes it can be put in place this winter, when energy bills rise.
""We are developing a new service that will be available for consumers to benefit from across this winter and will be announcing further information soon,"" a spokesman for National Grid ESO - which will run the scheme - said.
It is understood the company's proposals of how it will work, such as how money will be paid back to customers, are expected to be revealed in the next fortnight, with consultations taking place with energy providers and the UK's energy regulator Ofgem.
It has been reported that rebates for minimising the use of goods such as tumble dryers, dishwashers and games consoles during the peak hours of 17:00 and 20:00 could be as high as £6 per kWh saved.
National Grid ESO previously told the BBC the service is ""not about energy rationing"", despite fears over supplies, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine affecting oil and gas supplies to Europe.

when the price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - goes up again. It has been forecast to rise further to £4,650 in January.
Jack Beckwith, 25 and from County Durham, said the scheme would mean he is able to put his heating on this winter. 
He expects his bill to go up to £238 per month in October - from his current monthly average of £100 - wiping out his savings. 
""I generally keep on top of my usage and pay for what I use. I have some savings - but that was meant for emergencies - my leaky roof fund. That'll all go towards paying for the price increase,"" he told the BBC. 
""It's been a gradual realisation that I can't afford it.""
Jack said he was expecting to not meet up with friends, and has already said no to taking on a gym membership. He is also considering cutting back on his Spotify subscription, which could save around £10 per month.
""Off peak heating will be a lifeline,"" he said. ""It will literally will save lives if people can be made aware of it, and can use it, because it will mean they can put the heating on.""
National Grid ESO has hosted webinars with energy firms to ask for feedback on its proposals.
move follows a trial where Octopus Energy offered incentives for 100,000 customers who reduced consumption.
Octopus Energy has said during the trial its consumers received credit on their energy accounts and also had a ""self-refund option"" where they could get cash transferred to their bank accounts.

business	Hong Kong shares hit lowest level since 2009	"Shares in Hong Kong have slumped to the lowest level since the global financial crisis, after a major speech by the city's leader on Wednesday.
mark Hang Seng index fell by more than 3% to its lowest level since May 2009, before regaining some ground.
Investors are also concerned about the threat of a global economic slowdown as central banks around the world raise interest rates to tackle rising prices.
One financial expert told the BBC that the ""panic selling is ridiculous"".
In his first policy address yesterday, Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee announced measures to boost security and plans to attract more overseas talent to the territory.
However, he did not elaborate on economic targets for the city, which has lost ground to rival Asian financial centres like Singapore.
Hong Kong's economy is currently in a technical recession, after seeing two three-month periods in a row of contraction this year.
Until recently the city had some of the world's toughest coronavirus rules as it followed China's zero Covid policies.
""The Hang Seng has hit a 13-year low and nothing is really helping the fragile sentiment,"" Dickie Wong, executive director of Kingston Securities said.
""There's also a sense that tax rebates are not enough to draw foreigners back to Hong Kong,"" he added.
raders were also concerned about the Hong Kong government's ""unprecedented silence on key economic indicators,"" Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management said.
However, Mr Tay added that investors were mostly concerned about ""the economic outlook [of China] and a rise of Covid cases in the middle of the party congress in Beijing"".
More than 2,000 delegates have gathered this week in Beijing to elect leaders and debate key policies at the Communist Party congress.
On Sunday, President Xi Jinping is expected to be confirmed for a historic third term as party chief.
Other stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region were also lower on Thursday, with benchmark share indexes in Japan, South Korea and Australia losing ground.
Meanwhile, the Japanese yen weakened to a fresh 32-year low of more than 150 to the US dollar.
riggered further speculation that Japanese authorities will attempt to prop up the currency for the second time in the space of just a few weeks.

business	Rail strikes will drive passengers away, Grant Shapps says	"rain strikes will drive passengers away and threaten rather than protect rail workers' jobs, Grant Shapps says.
ransport secretary urged unions to call off next week's strikes, with thousands of workers set to walk out on 21, 23 and 25 June.
RMT union announced the strike action last week after talks over pay and redundancies fell through.
Passengers have been advised not to travel on trains unless necessary during the strikes.
But season ticket holders ""will be able to claim full compensation on strike days"", Mr Shapps said in a speech at a train depot in north London.
Network Rail said if strikes go ahead about half of all rail lines will be closed, with only a fifth of services running across Britain.
rvices that run will start and finish earlier, from 07:30 to 18:30, and some places will have no trains at all.
ming of these rail strikes were ""designed to inflict damage at the worst possible time"", Mr Shapps said.
He said the walkouts would cause ""misery"" for groups including workers, those heading to Glastonbury festival, and students sitting the 17 public exams over the strike period.
Mr Shapps said commuters, who three years ago may have had no alternative but to take the train, now have other options like Zoom meetings.
""Wave them goodbye, and it will endanger the jobs of thousands of rail workers,"" he said.
He added that unions were ""alienating"" passengers and freight customers with ""long and damaging strikes"".
rikes were not about a pay freeze as union bosses claimed, he said, because if the railways can make more money through reform, wages will go up.
Addressing rail workers, Mr Shapps said: ""Your union bosses have driven you to the verge of a national strike under false pretences. And rather than protect your jobs, they are actually threatening your jobs.""
ransport secretary was asked repeatedly why he could not meet with the unions and Network Rail, to try and avert next week's strikes.
In response, Mr Shapps said ""I can't settle this"", adding that ""it is for employers to negotiate pay"" and ""they set the terms and contracts"". 
Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, accused Mr Shapps of making ""disgraceful"" threats to railway workers' livelihoods and their right to strike. 
He called on the transport secretary to meet with unions to help reach a negotiated settlement. 
How will you be affected by the rail strikes?
Earlier, Tim Shoveller, Network Rail lead on the talks with the RMT, said he did not think the government could help with the situation.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The biggest thing we need to do with unions is work out between ourselves how we make the railway more efficient.""
He said this included ""how we use our people more wisely, so we run the railways even more safely than we do now, making better jobs, then providing that opportunity to reduce costs - that's the only solution.""
More than 40,000 RMT union members from Network Rail and 13 train firms plan to walk out on three days next week.
On the first day of the planned strike on 21 June, London Underground RMT workers plan to walk out in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses.
RMT union has claimed Network Rail plans to cut up to 2,500 jobs as part of a £2bn reduction in spending, with the proposed job cuts including workers who maintain tracks, signals and overhead lines.
It also said train operators had been subject to pay freezes and changes to their terms and conditions.
rail industry is under pressure to save money due to the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic and Network Rail has said it wants to modernise working practices.
It estimated between 1,500 and 2,000 fewer staff would be needed, but insists this could be achieved through voluntary means."	/news/business-61825019

Olly, 30, received a letter earlier this week telling him he will be moved from Reading to Luton on Friday.
He said he had no idea his father had brought him to the UK illegally until he was 16 and has only just been given the right to work this year.

entertainment	The Big Eurovision Party: Rylan to bring in 2023 with song contest stars	"What do you get when you put 15 Eurovision winners on one stage? A great big party, that's what.
Six months before Liverpool hosts the song contest on behalf of Ukraine, about 15,000 fans travelled to Amsterdam's Ziggo Dome to see acts from competitions gone by perform.
As part of its New Year's Eve line-up, BBC One is showing Het Grote Songfestivalfeest - renamed The Big Eurovision Party for UK viewers and hosted by Rylan.
Granted, some songs have stood the test of time more than others, but Loreen's 2012 hit Euphoria had the crowd bouncing 10 years later.
""It was needed then, and it's needed now,"" she tells BBC News backstage at the concert.
""Euphoria has some sort of deepness to it that touches people on a real level,"" she says. ""Some songs just connect.""
39-year-old is often credited with changing the direction of Eurovision after her success, and she's hoping to represent Sweden again in 2023.
Eurovision-related events outside of May, when the contest is held, was something Israel's winner Netta had no idea about when she competed four years ago. 
""There wasn't any career before that. I was singing in bars and just trying to make a living in a very modest way, trying to sing back-up, singing covers at weddings,"" she tells BBC News. 
""I went from anonymity to stardom, and everything changed for a girl who'd calculate the amount of money - 'What do I buy, milk or beer?' - to people from Amsterdam calling me saying, 'We want to fly you here, how many people do you need?'.""  
She admits, though, it's ""a challenge"" to get fans to appreciate her non-Eurovision material, but says she's working in America with music producers to try to change that. 
Other performers agree that it can be strangely tricky, after performing in front of 160 million viewers, to get people around the world to listen to future releases.
But in recent years, acts like Måneskin, Rosa Linn and Duncan Laurence have all managed to have huge success in the US, largely down to TikTok.
""To me it was always a dream to be known as a musician on a global scale,"" Dutch singer Laurence explains. ""The biggest moment was when we hit the one billion streams on all platforms, and I got this award on stage in Rotterdam at Eurovision that I brought to The Netherlands.""
""You have to explain it's not X Factor, it's not The Voice, it's way bigger. Once it's in their head, they're like: 'I want to watch this'.""
28-year-old says American audiences see him as a new singer-songwriter, who are largely unaware of the world's largest live music event, but he's proud to be part of the three acts ""finally"" getting Eurovision songs to chart in America.
As well as Loreen, Netta and Laurence, the Netherlands gig allowed fans to see two winning Ukrainian acts, including this year's Kalush Orchestra.
rowd roared every time an act shouted ""Slava Ukraini"" (glory to Ukraine).
Jamala, who won in 2016 for her song about the 1944 deportation of Crimean Tatars, was dressed in the country's flag of yellow and blue for her performance.
""I know there are many people here tonight with light in their heart,"" she said on stage. 
""Please share it with my country and stand with Ukraine.""
Standing with Eurovision fans is something Ireland's Johnny Logan will always do, telling the crowd: ""Thank you for my life"".
""The people out there that love Eurovision opened up the whole world to me,"" the 68-year-old tells BBC News. 
""These days I sell out everywhere I work. A lot of people have to ask the question, 'If he's still around, why?' - and I can still deliver.
""When you stand up in the middle of this, I'm very humbled when I step back from the microphone and let the crowd take over the chorus"".
Like Loreen, Logan is a Eurovision legend - and not just with fans, with fellow winners too. 
Alexander Rybak, 2009's winner for Norway, interrupts our interview to say goodbye to Logan. 
""I just had to hug,"" he says. ""Johnny Logan is not just my favourite Eurovision singer, but my favourite heart-warming singer. He has heart. 
""A lot of artists use music to promote their talent but Johnny uses his talent to promote music.""
Planning for next year's competition in Liverpool is already under way, but it'll be a while yet before it's known which act will be representing the United Kingdom. 
Sam Ryder, after his success in 2022, has already ruled himself out. He became one of the UK's best ambassadors for the competition in Turin, constantly talking about the love and togetherness it brings.
Loreen ends the night by agreeing with the Space Man singer, telling the BBC: ""It has opened up my career and I've met so many wonderful people.

Actress Kirstie Alley, best known for featuring in the comedy Cheers in the 1980s and 90s, has died of cancer at 71, according to a family statement. 
Alley won an Emmy award and a Golden Globe for her role as bar manager Rebecca Howe on the popular TV series.
Kansas-born star also appeared in the Look Who's Talking film franchise and the TV sitcom Veronica's Closet.
Her former castmates Ted Danson and John Travolta led the tributes, noting her warm heart and wicked humour.
""We are sad to inform you that our incredible, fierce and loving mother has passed away,"" her children wrote, in a statement that did not specify what cancer she had, but said it was ""only recently discovered"".
""As iconic as she was on screen, she was an even more amazing mother and grandmother,"" they continued, saying she had been surrounded by her family when she died.
raised her ""zest and passion for life, her children, grandchildren and her many animals, not to mention her eternal joy of creating"". 
In Cheers, the beloved NBC sitcom set in a Boston bar, Rebecca Howe - bar manager and cocktail waitress - soon became a fans' favourite, fending off advances from Danson's womanising bar owner Sam Malone. 
First appearing as a strong independent woman, the character repeatedly had failed romances, often with rich men, becoming more insecure and frustrated as a result.
She appeared in 147 episodes after joining the show at the height of its popularity in 1987 and continued to appear until its end in 1993.
In a statement to Deadline, Danson said: ""Her ability to play a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown was both moving and hysterically funny.
""She made me laugh 30 years ago when she shot that scene, and she made me laugh today just as hard,"" he added, referring to having caught an old episode of Cheers on a flight this week. 
""As I got off the plane, I heard that Kirstie had died,"" he went on. ""I am so sad and so grateful for all the times she made me laugh. I send my love to her children. As they well know, their mother had a heart of gold. I will miss her.""
Kelsey Grammer, who played the psychiatrist Frasier Crane, told the PA news agency he had ""loved"" the actress.
In a separate statement provided to PA, Rhea Perlman, who played head-waitress Carla Tortelli, said she had ""never met anyone remotely like"" Alley and would miss her ""very, very much"".
""Kirstie was a unique and wonderful person and friend,"" Perlman said. ""Her joy of being was boundless.""
She added: ""We became friends almost instantly when she joined the cast of Cheers. She loved kids and my kids loved her too.""
""I feel so thankful to have known her,"" she continued.
Speaking to US chat show host David Letterman in 1993, after having wrapped up filming on the final series of Cheers, Alley explained she had called a meeting of all the actors and director, pitching the idea that the show should return for six more episodes so ""we go out with style and class and we don't let the fans down"".
She jokingly explained how her best laid plans then fell apart as she began sobbing uncontrollably while delivering her pitch.
""It was like a group therapy session where people were saying this literally, 'go with it... let it out!'"" she smiled.
""It was so degrading. Then I thought, screw you people are old and I'm young, I still have a career!""
Born in Wichita, Kansas, Alley dropped out of university and moved to Los Angeles to work as an interior designer and pursue her interest in Scientology.
It was an interest she kept throughout her life, reportedly donating $5m (£4.1m) to the church in 2007.
She made her film debut in 1982 in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. 
Following her success in Cheers, Alley starred alongside Travolta in the big screen family rom-com Look Who's Talking, and its two sequels.
ravolta took to Instagram to pay his respects, saying theirs was ""one of the most special relationships I've ever had."" ""I love you Kirstie,"" he wrote alongside a photo of her. ""I know we will see each other again.""
In 1993, Alley won a second Emmy for best lead actress, for the TV movie David's Mother.
From 1997 to 2000, she starred as lead in the sitcom Veronica's Closet, earning additional Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for her role as the head of a New York City lingerie company.
She also featured in the 1999 film Drop Dead Gorgeous, a dark comedy about a beauty pageant.
Alley, who was a spokesperson for American weight loss management company Jenny Craig, gave a glimpse of the irony and humour with which she approached her battle to lose weight and get back on TV regularly in the 2005 comedy series Fat Actress.  
And more recently, she worked with Jamie Lee Curtis on the satirical comedy horror Scream Queens. 
Curtis posted online that the pair had had a ""mutual respect and connection"".
""She was a great comic foil in Scream Queens and a beautiful mama bear in her very real life. She helped me buy onesies for my family that year for Christmas.
""We agreed to disagree about some things but had a mutual respect and connection. Sad news.""
Vocal Donald Trump-supporter Alley said, in an interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox Nation last year, that she was advised in 2015 to keep her political views private.
Having not done so, she claimed she was subsequently ""blackballed"" by Hollywood afterwards.
Reacting to the news of her death, Trump posted on Truth Social: ""Kirstie was a great person who truly loved the USA. She will be missed!"".
Alley's charms found a new audience later in her career as she appeared on a string of reality TV shows, finishing as runner-up on both Dancing with the Stars as well as the UK edition of Celebrity Big Brother
Earlier this year she was unveiled as the performer inside the ""Baby Mammoth"" character costume on the US version of The Masked Singer.
""I've done a lot of things in my career,"" she beamed, ""but I've never gotten to be in the circus!"".
Alley was married twice, once to the actor Parker Stevenson with whom she adopted two children."	/news/world-us-canada-63868992

entertainment	Ghost Town: 'The song Margaret Thatcher wishes was never released'	"July 1981.
Riots have broken out around Britain.
Charles and Diana are about to marry. 
And backstage at Top of The Pops, The Specials are falling apart. 
In a few minutes they will perform their latest hit Ghost Town, which over the years, would come to be regarded as one of the greatest British singles of all time. It was a track which bottled the discord, racial tensions and societal breakdown happening in the UK that summer. 
re had already been riots in Brixton that April, over the increased use of a new stop-and-search policy, the so-called sus law, which was named Operation Swamp. Police were said to have mounted a campaign of harassment against the black community in south London.
rry Hall is telling the band that he too has had enough. Worn down by touring, band infighting and struggling to deal with success, he wants out. It is too difficult to be singing about disharmony, while surrounded by it, both inside and outside The Specials. 
""We knew it was going to end as we were recording it (Ghost Town),"" Terry Hall told Front Row in 2019.
""It was bizarre. It took about eight months to record. I don't think there were more than two of us in the studio at any point. Those weren't good signs really. It finished up with me in a living room in Tottenham singing Ghost Town. It was all over the place. But it was a great way to bow out.""
He was 22.
g was written by the band's founding member Jerry Dammers, but it is also the track with which lead singer Terry Hall is most closely identified. Every TV and radio report about his death has centred on Ghost Town. 
gle was simply one of the most timely releases in music history.   
""Talk about zeitgeist. That one song suddenly captured so much,"" remembered Specials fan and Bend It Like Beckham director Gurinder Chada in the 2021 BBC Documentary 2 Tone: The Sound of Coventry.
""If there is one song Margaret Thatcher wishes never got released, it's probably Ghost Town,"" she added. 
On 7 July 1981, Radio One announced that Ghost Town had replaced Michael Jackson's One Day In Your Life at the top of the charts. 
me day, newspaper front pages were full of reports about the first ever use of CS gas grenades by the police on mainland Britain, as they struggled to contain the Toxteth Riots. These were sparked by tensions between police and the local community in Liverpool. 
By the end of the week more than 20 towns and cities including London, Nottingham, Wolverhampton, Leeds and Luton had riots of their own. The Specials were providing the soundtrack. 
In 2 Tone: The Sound of Coventry, Dammers explained how the creation of the song started with him sitting at his home organ, trying different diminished chords and working out how wailing could substitute a chorus.
""I think I wrote the music first. I was working on that for ages. The lyrics I wrote on tour just seeing what was going down around the country. It was about the recession and three million people on the dole. It's about the police harassment and unemployment. It was like a perfect storm really.""
For years there has been debate over whether or not Ghost Town is specifically about their hometown of Coventry. The decline of the car industry had turned a thriving post-war economy into a concrete jungle.
Neville Staple from The Specials has stated he believes the song should be taken more generally: ""In Coventry and all over England it painted the same picture. This town is coming like a ghost town.""
rry Hall's own understanding of Ghost Town changed over the last 40 years. In 1981, when speaking to the New York Times, he insisted: ""We were talking about riots in Bristol and Brixton. The fact that it became popular when it did was just a weird coincidence.""
But speaking on BBC Radio Five Live in 2019, he told Nihal Arthanayake: ""We made a record about how we saw the north of Britain. People think it was about Coventry. It wasn't. It was about Glasgow and Liverpool and Newcastle. It was about the north."" 
Ghost Town has certainly had an after-life. 
When Amy Winehouse joined The Specials on stage at the V Festival in 2009, it was Ghost Town that she wanted to sing. 
In Father Ted, when the priests organised a disco and the DJ, Father ""Spin Master"" O'Dwyer only has one record that everyone has to dance to all night, the 7 inch on repeat is Ghost Town. 
On Desert Island Discs, it's a recent favourite, having been picked four times in the last three years: by the charity worker Claire Horton, the Director of Tate Maria Balshaw, the foreign affairs specialist Fiona Hill and the actor Rupert Everett, who called it ""one of the great songs of the era"".
And in 2020, The Guardian named it the second best number one single in the UK of all time, behind West End Girls by Pet Shop Boys, a song released four year later and not entirely dissimilar with the sense of urban decay which it creates. 
Ghost Town is now considered to be an all-time classic, but its reign over the summer of 1981 came to an ignominious end. The day before 28 million people watched the wedding of the future King to Lady Diana Spencer, The Specials were dethroned. 
unchtime unveiling of the charts revealed that rising 22 places to number one was none other than Shakin' Stevens with Green Door. 
's era as chart-dominating stars had well and truly been slammed shut by Shaky. Within months, Hall had formed Fun Boy Three and The Specials in their original incarnation were over.
More than 40 years on Ghost Town stands as their defining work - the perfect coming together of pop and politics at exactly the right moment in history. It was that rarest of things, a song dealing with subjects found in The Economist while the band were on the cover of Smash Hits. Special indeed."	/news/entertainment-arts-64039245

entertainment	Jason David Frank: Power Rangers star dies aged 49	"Actor Jason David Frank, who originated the role of Tommy Oliver in the Power Rangers TV series, has died aged 49.
His manager Justine Hunt confirmed to the Associated Press the actor died on Saturday in Texas, describing him as a ""wonderful human being"" 
Frank's character started out as the Green Ranger in the first season of the show and was introduced to viewers as an enemy of the Power Rangers.
But he later became good and ultimately turned into the White Ranger.
Hunt asked for the ""privacy of his family and friends during this horrible time as we come to terms with the loss of such a wonderful human being"".
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers launched in 1993 on Fox Kids and initially aired for three years, the vigilante action heroes quickly becoming popular with young audiences.
franchise continued over the following years with a string of new iterations and adaptations, with Frank often returning to his role in the series and becoming a favourite with the show's fans.
Walter Jones, one of Frank's co-stars on the show, wrote on Instagram: ""Can't believe it... RIP Jason David Frank. My heart is sad to have lost another member of our special family.""
Frank's death comes two decades after that of co-star Thuy Trang, who died aged 27 in 2001 from injuries sustained in a car accident.
Frank's Green Ranger was initially introduced as an antagonist in the series - who had been placed under a spell by the Power Rangers' nemesis Rita Repulsa.
Originally scheduled for a limited appearance, Frank ended up becoming a series regular due to the character's popularity among viewers.
After the Green Ranger was freed from Rita's mind manipulation, viewers saw him transform into the White Ranger - a role that Frank fulfilled for the two seasons that followed.
Frank appeared in a plethora of spin-offs and reboots of the series, including Power Rangers Turbo, Power Rangers Zeo, Power Rangers Wild Force, Power Rangers Megaforce, Power Rangers: DinoThunder and Power Rangers Ninja Steel.
As well as being an on-screen action hero, in real life Frank also possessed a black belt in karate and was experienced with various other styles of martial arts, including Taekwondo, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai.
r was inducted into both the World Karate Union Hall of Fame and the Black Belt Hall of Fame.
He also taught martial arts and co-founded the Rising Sun Karate Academy. He is survived by two sons and two daughters."	/news/entertainment-arts-63700335

entertainment	Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas is You copyright case dropped	"Singer Mariah Carey is no longer being sued for copyright infringement over her hit song All I Want for Christmas is You, after country singer Andy Stone dropped his legal action.
Songwriter Mr Stone sued the popstar in June, claiming he co-wrote a song with the same name five years earlier.
He told the court he would dismiss the case - but legally he could refile it.
A must-have on any festive playlist, Carey's mega-hit is one of the best known Christmas records of all time.
Mr Stone, who performs under the name Vince Vance with the band Vince Vance and the Valiants, previously filed the lawsuit in a New Orleans federal court - where he also filed to have the case dismissed.
He was claiming at least $20m (£16m) in damages, arguing that Carey exploited his ""popularity"" and ""style"".
Despite sharing a title, the two songs are musically different, but Mr Stone claimed that Carey did not ask for permission to use the song name and had earned ""undeserved profits"" from it. 
It is not unusual for different songs to have the same name, and the United States Copyright Office lists 177 entries on its website under the title All I Want for Christmas is You.
Since appearing on the album Merry Christmas in 1994, the song has topped the charts in several countries and by 2017 had reportedly earned Carey more than $60m (£48m) in royalties.
It has been streamed over one billion times on Spotify.
In a recent memoir, Carey admitted to composing ""most of the song on a cheap little Casio keyboard"".

For the last decade Elisha Hughes, 24, has volunteered in Blaenymaes, Swansea, where she's lived her whole life.
She said the area has a ""stigma"", so she wants to make sure local children have every opportunity to succeed. 
On one frosty mid-December morning she ran a Christmas craft session for dozens of the local children.
was part of a project in Blaenymaes run with University of Wales Trinity Saint David, which aims to provide opportunities for people to engage in family and adult learning activities.
After volunteering at the local drop in centre since she was 14, Elisha now works for the university, helping to widen access to their courses. 
""People say to you 'you can't do something', I wanted to show you can,"" she said. 
Blaenymaes is one of the most deprived areas of Swansea but Elisha said it's resilient.
Blaenymaes drop in centre is a place where local people meet up and chat. It has a foodbank, community clothing shop, vegetable garden, litter-picking hub and a food share scheme.
Wendy Howells is 60 and attended a Christmas craft course at the centre recently.
She said she needed something to help her get out of the house following a rough period a few years ago.
Wendy said she has found the activities at the centre ""invaluable"" on her road to recovery. 
""It's like a jigsaw puzzle of people, we are all different shapes and sizes here at the centre, but together we make a beautiful  picture and we make a community,"" she said.
As a result of the partnership between the centre and the university she has now started taking courses in her community.

entertainment	Queen's funeral composer: I had to keep my work secret	"When a piece of music was premiered in front of a global audience at Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, there was one television viewer who surprisingly had also never heard it sung before - its composer, Sir James MacMillan.
His wife had recently broken her foot - and although Sir James had been invited to Westminster Abbey for the funeral, he had stayed at home in Scotland to help her.
Sir James had not even heard a rehearsal of the piece, which he had written in secret, and until the night before the funeral was not completely sure it would be performed.
So the first time he heard his choral piece was when it was sung in front of the Royal Family and world leaders crammed into the abbey.
""I watched it with my wife on the television,"" the 63-year-old told BBC News. ""It was a pinch-me moment really."" He remained ""astonished"" and very proud to have become part of such a historic moment.
It was also a glimpse into the extent of long-term planning for the funeral.
""I was approached by the abbey in deep secrecy in 2011,"" Sir James said.
""It was for the commendation part of the funeral service and I was asked to keep very quiet about it and not tell anybody.
""It was the text 'Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?', which I was told was one of the Queen's favourite passages from scripture and that strangely hadn't been set a lot to music.""
A recording of the piece was released on Friday.
Sir James said he had written the choral piece quickly, despite being well aware of the huge responsibility. 
It had needed to be music for an intense personal and national event, a key spiritual moment in the funeral, not just ""entertainment"", he said.
And when it was finished, the music went to Westminster Abbey, where it stayed out of sight. 
""They didn't want any indication of these plans coming out,"" Sir James said.
When news of the Queen's death broke, he realised his music, written more than a decade earlier, could now be used.
""I got the score out and looked at it again to remind myself of what the music would sound like,"" Sir James said. ""It's always different when you play it on the piano - but that's what composing is, you've got to imagine sounds that are not in the room with you.""
With the funeral preparations under way, Sir James was told his music was being rehearsed in London - but it was not confirmed it would be performed until 22:00 on the night before.
re was also a new piece from master of the Queen's music Judith Weir, who set to music the words of Psalm 42, ""Like as the hart"". The composer, now master of the King's music, declined to comment on her commission.
In the solemn grandeur of the state funeral, Sir James heard voices singing his piece for the very first time. The choristers performed his elegiac anthem on the most public stage imaginable.
Sir James said he still did not know how much the Queen had been involved in choosing the music for her funeral. He had met her on a number of occasions and in 2015 had been knighted in her birthday honours. 
King Charles III had always been supportive of his music, Sir James said. But he believes the Queen liked the chosen Bible text, because of its optimism.
""There's a sense of hope for the future,"" Sir James said, with the words assuming death was not the end and there was a heaven.
gin: ""Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come."" 
""The words pointed to her deep faith, she was a persuasive and quiet advocate of the Christian perspective, communicating in a way that many clergy can't manage,"" Sir James said.
And he rejected suggestions the text ""Who shall separate us... ?"" contained a coded message about the Scottish independent debate, saying: ""There's not a lot in St Paul's letter to the Romans that's about Scottish constitutional reform."" 
Sir James is the only living composer whose music was played at both the funeral and the thanksgiving service for the Queen at St Giles's Cathedral in Edinburgh.
His choral music is a blend of ancient and modern, spiritual and contemplative, often with a Scottish inflection - a mix that might well have appealed to the Queen, who he said seemed to combine ""the deep past and the modern"".
Sir James was already recognised as a leading modern composer but the spotlight of the Queen's funeral has brought him an even greater reach.
""I'm beginning to hear about performances of the piece all over the world,"" he said.
""It's one the most significant things that has ever happened to me."" "	/news/uk-63782432
entertainment	Joe Lycett did not shred £10k in David Beckham Qatar protest	"Comedian Joe Lycett has revealed he did not really shred £10,000 during a protest against David Beckham's role as an ambassador for the Qatar World Cup.
Lycett livestreamed himself apparently destroying the cash on Sunday after the ex-England footballer did not respond to his ultimatum to drop the job in support of LGBT people.
On Monday, Lycett confirmed he had in fact donated the money to charity.
He said destroying the cash would have been ""irresponsible"".
Some LGBT fans have boycotted the Fifa Men's World Cup over Qatar's treatment of gay people, as same-sex relationships are criminalised in the country.
In a video update posted on Twitter, Lycett explained: ""The truth is, the money that went into the shredder was real, but the money that came out was fake.
""In fact, the 10 grand had already been donated to LGBTQ+ charities before I even pressed send on the initial tweet last week.""
""I would never destroy real money,"" he told his followers, ""I would never be so irresponsible."" 
Addressing Beckham directly, he added: ""I never expected to hear from you - it was an empty threat designed to get people talking.
""In many ways, it was like your deal with Qatar, David - total [rubbish] from the start.""
In the previous video, Lycett described Beckham as a ""gay icon"" but warned that this status was now under threat. 
Birmingham-born comic ended his latest update by actually shredding a copy of Beckham's Attitude front cover, saying he had been given the blessing of the magazine, which was the first gay publication to shoot a Premier League star.
Warning: Lycett's video reveal contains some strong language.
ublicity stunt, which took place on the same day the controversial World Cup began, initially received a mixed reaction.
Some defended Lycett, arguing that he had succeeded in gaining more than £10,000 worth of valuable publicity for the LGBT cause; while others suggested he should have instead donated the money to charity, which it now transpires he has done.
rtainer shared a video of the apparent shredding on social media alongside the caption ""a platform for progress"", using a phrase Beckham himself had used in a promotional campaign about the tournament in the Middle East.

In the clip, Lycett was seen placing wads of what appeared to be cash into an industrial shredder while wearing a rainbow tulle outfit, but it was not clear whether the banknotes were genuine.
He set the former England captain a deadline of midday on 20 November to take action after it was reported he had signed a £10m deal with the Fifa World Cup hosts.
median said he would donate £10,000 of his own money to LGBT charities if Beckham ended the sponsorship deal before the tournament started.
Beckham has not publicly commented on Lycett's stunt.
World Cup has been shrouded in controversy due to issues around LGBT rights in Qatar, along with the host nation's treatment of migrant workers.
It continued on Monday as it was confirmed that England, Wales and other European nations will not wear the OneLove armband at the World Cup because of the threat of players being booked.
, including England's Harry Kane and Gareth Bale of Wales, had planned to wear the armband during matches to promote diversity and inclusion.
A joint statement from seven football associations said they could not put their players ""in a position where they could face sporting sanctions"".

rowd chanted his name as he took to the stage at Manchester's AO arena.
He had to compose himself before telling fans: ""How am I supposed to do comedy now? You'll have me in bits... I can't believe you made me cry.""
It was the first of 110 arena dates that the Bolton star will perform over the next two-and-a-half years. 
He had been due to go on tour in 2018, but cancelled that due to ""unforeseen family circumstances"".
Peter Kay talks to Zoe Ball: 'I should only be on the news if I'm dead!'
On Friday, he showed about 20,000 fans in Manchester that he was still the king of making us laugh at seemingly ordinary stuff that we all remember and recognise - and pointing out the ridiculous things about real life.
""It's stuff that people relate to, but he just makes it so daft. It's so funny,"" said Calum Burns, 23, from Manchester, who was seeing Kay in person for the first time.
Olivia Matthews, also 23, added: ""There's nothing too serious. Everything's light-hearted. That's what we like about him.
""His last tour was 12 years ago and we were 10 or 11, so we're a new audience coming into it. I've always known him and always liked him, growing up. We've got to see his material, but never live.""
Jill Fraser, 36, from Edinburgh said of Kay's appeal: ""He's got a style of comedy that's just nice and easy, it's inoffensive, it's funny. He's got a lot of energy, and it's just everything you want from a Friday night comedy show.""
Fans in Manchester give their verdict on Peter Kay's performance
Paul Stokes, 63, from Wigan, said afterwards: ""He was a little bit overwhelmed when he first came out, but he was excellent.""
""He's genuine,"" added Deborah Evitt, 56, from Manchester. ""He's a genuine person. You could tell what he did on that stage, he did from the heart. That's why I enjoyed it.""
Warning: mild spoilers about Peter Kay's show
His down-to-earth, cheeky stand-up style and everyday subject matter haven't changed much.
re were nostalgic jokes about childhood chocolate bars, TV theme tunes, bingo and baked beans, plus more of his favourite misheard pop lyrics - and a routine putting a clever new spin on his ""garlic bread"" catchphrase.
march of tastes and technologies - and the bewilderment that causes among an older generation - have always provided him with rich material.
But while he's still ridiculing his befuddled elders, Kay is now also trying to get his head around the habits of his own children, with their reliance on devices and online deliveries.
He felt freshest when poking fun at both modern life and himself - whether that was highlighting the challenges of ordering from Just Eat, or the perils of taking intimate photos to send to a GP.
He became Britain's most popular stand-up comedian by being rude enough to avoid being bland, but not so offensive or controversial that he alienated people. 
me, there were occasions where he sailed close to political incorrectness, although he was at pains to claim he wanted to steer clear of cancel culture territory.
He didn't answer why he retreated from the spotlight - but we never expected, or really wanted him to, given the night's celebratory air. People were just glad to have him back.
And a spectacular and big-budget (by stand-up standards) final act took his love of pop culture nostalgia and silliness to new crowd-pleasing heights.
Kay has made occasional live appearances since scrapping his last tour, but this set of dates is the first time most fans have seen him live for more than a decade.
49-year-old will play 41 more times at the Manchester venue, the biggest arena in the UK, culminating with his final scheduled tour date on 25 July 2025.

entertainment	Liverpool's Eurovision arena investigates safety concerns at Jamie Webster gig	"Liverpool arena where the Eurovision Song Contest will be held next year has apologised and pledged to investigate after fans complained about safety concerns at a sold-out concert.
Some fans at the M&S Bank Arena to see Jamie Webster on Saturday reported overcrowding and poor ticket checks.
Paul Lang, from Birkenhead, said: ""It didn't feel like a safe environment.""
ue said there were reports of overcrowding but it was resolved, and appropriate ticket checks were done.
Police said they ""did attend the venue briefly"". Indie singer-songwriter Webster, who was playing his biggest home town gig, had to cut the encore from his set.
Mr Lang told BBC Radio Merseyside his tickets weren't checked, and the entrance tunnel was ""completely full"".
""The group around us when we were getting let in, I would say at least 15-20 people walked away and were just not dealing with it, and more people were coming out, getting a bit worked up, panicked about it, and just said, 'It's just not worth it for our own safety.'""
Staff were ""just standing around"" and ""didn't seem to really show any interest"", he said.
""It felt like, if we did become in a situation that we really didn't want to be in and we were in that tunnel, I don't feel like the staff would have done anything at all really.""
Another fan, Liam Kelly, also from the Wirral, said there were long queues outside the venue.
""By the time we got close to the door, the head steward told us that we weren't going to get in because it was overcrowded,"" he told Radio Merseyside. ""They were her words.
""There were people who were coming out of the gig in tears, a lot of people looking very stressed, and shouting for people to not go in. Quite a few people in the queue at that point turned around and left.""
After the head steward got into an argument, ""she kind of left and then there was this chaos at the door where everyone just started to walk in"", Mr Kelly added.
""I presented my phone to be scanned and I had all the tickets for my group on there. So the first ticket they came to was one that had already been used by somebody else. It scanned red, and the person who's got my ticket [to check it] did not care. He's just waved me in, and that was the moment that I looked around, and nobody was having their tickets checked.""
xperience of getting in was ""really horrible"", he said. ""It was the entrance way and the bar area that were absolute chaos. You couldn't move. It took ages to get through.""
Once fully inside, it was the busiest he had ever seen the arena, ""but the venue itself inside didn't feel unsafe"", he added.
In a statement, Faye Dyer, managing director of ACC Liverpool Group, which runs the arena, said: ""There were reports of overcrowding at one of the floor bars, however the crowd congestion was resolved and people were dispersed.
""Merseyside Police received a report of concern for safety at the venue just before 9.30pm and attended the venue for a short period whilst our events security dealt with the incident. The event was deemed safe to continue.
""The process for checking tickets is a rigorous one and we understand all appropriate checks were made on the night. The safety of our customers is of the utmost importance; we take any incident seriously and a detailed investigation has already begun.
""We sincerely apologise to both the artist Jamie, who was playing the biggest show of his life, and to his fans for any aspects of their experience which fell short of their expectations. We wish to thank Jamie and his promoter for their support in removing the encore to ensure the remainder of the show continued to operate safely.""
A spokesperson added: ""As safety is our number one priority and as operators of the venue, we agreed with the artist's promoter that Jamie would not perform an encore. This was not a police request.""
On Tuesday, the venue gave more details in a set of FAQs, which said its investigation would ""help us understand the issues from this event and ensure we learn from it"".

Opening on 22 October at Bath's Victoria Art Gallery, Bath, Bristol and Beyond will feature over 100 new oil paintings.
Nicknamed ""Pete the Street"", Mr Brown is well known for capturing everyday life on the streets.
He painted the atmosphere in London following the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
Mr Brown said he felt ""obliged"" to record the crowds outside Buckingham Palace.
Previously he has captured atmospheric views in all weathers, even during snowstorms. He works outside wearing fingerless mittens.
Most of the works in his new exhibition were painted during the Covid-19 pandemic, showing the impact of restrictions on the places where Mr Brown set up his easel.
Mr Brown spent around 6 hours painting the crowds outside Buckingham Palace, capturing thousands of mourners as they passed by to pay their respects.
""I was intrigued to see how the public were reacting to the Queen's death,"" he said.
In his 30 years of painting Mr Brown has grown accustom to painting street life quickly.
""The good thing about working quickly is you're not doing things so deliberately,"" he said.
Mr Brown believes painting is a medium that is still alive today, saying it ""has a different place to that of pointing to an iPhone and taking snaps.

entertainment	Kanye West interview pulled over 'more hate speech'	"An upcoming episode of the YouTube talk show The Shop: Uninterrupted has been scrapped after Kanye West allegedly used ""hate speech and extremely dangerous stereotypes"" in an interview.
move came as it emerged the star had shared a series of comments based on racist conspiracy theories in a separate interview with Fox News.
Fox removed those segments before broadcast, but the footage was leaked to technology website Motherboard.
West has not commented on either case.
BBC has asked both him and Fox News for a response.
r, who is legally known as Ye, was previously suspended from Instagram and Twitter for making anti-Semitic comments.
me in response to a backlash against his show at Paris Fashion Week, where he wore a t-shirt carrying the slogan ""White Lives Matter"".
Anti-Defamation League has called the phrase ""hate speech"" and attributed it to white supremacists, who began using it in 2015 in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.
Amid the backlash, he appeared on Fox News, where he told host Tucker Carlson the t-shirt was ""funny"" and ""the obvious thing to do"".
In unaired clips from the same interview, which leaked on Tuesday, West detailed his belief in an unfounded anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Planned Parenthood was founded ""to control the Jew population"" in conjunction with the Ku Klux Klan.
""When I say Jew, I mean the 12 lost tribes of Judah... who the people know as the race Black really are,"" he told host Tucker Carlson, referring to a claim, unsupported by historical evidence, that Black people are the ""real"" Jewish race, and that Jews are attempting to ""steal"" their birthright.
West also complained that his children were attending a school where Kwanzaa - an annual celebration of African-American culture - is taught, saying he would rather they learned about the Jewish holiday Hanukkah because ""at least it will come with some financial engineering"", yet another anti-Semitic trope.
In another clip, the rapper confirmed he had received the Covid-19 vaccine, despite previously claiming the shots were ""the mark of the beast"" and part of a plot to implant chips in people. 
He also claimed that ""fake children"" had been placed in his home to manipulate and ""sexualize"" his four children with former wife Kim Kardashian.
Fox has not explained why it excluded these clips from its broadcast, although most television interviews are edited and condensed for clarity.
Producers of The Shop: Uninterrupted on the other hand, decided against airing their interview with West altogether, and said they would not share details of his comments. 
Maverick Carter, who produces the show with basketball legend LeBron James, told the Andscape website: ""Kanye was booked weeks ago and, after talking to Kanye directly the day before we taped, I believed he was capable of a respectful discussion and he was ready to address all his recent comments. 
""Unfortunately, he used The Shop to reiterate more hate speech and extremely dangerous stereotypes.""
ment continued: ""While The Shop embraces thoughtful discourse and differing opinions, we have zero tolerance for hate speech of any kind and will never allow our channels to be used to promote hate. 
""I take full responsibility for believing Kanye wanted a different conversation and apologise to our guests and crew. Hate speech should never have an audience.""
It is believed that James was not present as the interview took place.
West was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago and has publicly spoken about his challenges with his mental health.
However, medical experts and people who share West's condition have warned that mental health problems do not go hand-in-hand with anti-Semitism.
""There are many people who don't have mental health issues who are racist and bigoted. And there are people with mental health issues who are not racist or bigoted,"" clinical psychologist Carla Manly told USA Today. ""We want to see those as two very different issues.""
""I think Kanye is honestly just an idiot,"" Sam, who has bipolar disorder, told BBC World Service. 
""He rolls with his disorder and lets it harm whoever is around him, and I think that's extremely irresponsible. 
""I don't think he should be associated with bipolar disorder or the mental health movement, because he doesn't speak for us.""

entertainment	Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: Author warns about 'epidemic of self-censorship'	"Author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has said she worries society is suffering from an ""epidemic of self-censorship"".
In a BBC lecture on freedom of speech, the writer said young people were growing up ""afraid to ask questions for fear of asking the wrong questions"".
Such a climate could lead to ""the death of curiosity, the death of learning and the death of creativity"", the award-winning Nigerian author warned.
""No human endeavour requires freedom as much as creativity does,"" she added.
Adichie, known for novels including Half Of A Yellow Sun and Americanah, was speaking in the first of the four annual Reith Lectures for Radio 4, all this year on themes of freedom.
She argued that Sir Salman Rushdie's controversial novel The Satanic Verses would ""probably not"" be published today - something he himself said in 2012.
Earlier this year, Sir Salman was attacked on stage at a literary event. He suffered a damaged liver, severed nerves in an arm and lost sight in an eye.
Satanic Verses, Sir Salman's fourth novel, led to death threats from Iran in the 1980s. Some Muslims regard the book as blasphemous. 
""Would Rushdie's novel be published today? Probably not,"" Adichie said. ""Would it even be written? Possibly not.""
She said literature was increasingly viewed ""through ideological rather than artistic lenses"".
She continued: ""Nothing demonstrates this better than the recent phenomenon of 'sensitivity readers' in the world of publishing, people whose job it is to cleanse unpublished manuscripts of potentially offensive words.
""This, in my mind, negates the very idea of literature.""
If any of the books that had ""formed and inspired and consoled"" her had been censored, ""I would perhaps today be lost"", she said.
45-year-old also expressed concern that some people don't speak up for fear of vicious criticism or becoming the latest target of cancel culture.
Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie talks to BBC 100 Women
""We are all familiar with stories of people who have said or written something and then faced a terrible online backlash,"" she said.
""There is a difference between valid criticism, which should be part of free expression, and this kind of backlash, ugly personal insults, putting addresses of homes and children's schools online, trying to make people lose their jobs.
""To anyone who thinks, well, some people who have said terrible things deserve it - no. Nobody deserves it. It is unconscionable barbarism. It is a virtual vigilante action whose aim is not just to silence the person who has spoken, but to create a vengeful atmosphere that deters others from speaking.""
BBC Newsnight: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie speaks to Kirsty Wark

entertainment	St David's Hall: Cardiff cabinet backs lease to AMG	"One of Wales' best known concert halls could be leased to a private entertainment firm under plans agreed in principle by leading councillors.
St David's Hall in Cardiff would be run by Academy Music Group (AMG), which manages concert venues across the UK.
re has been opposition to the plan, with musicians speaking out, and a petition launched.
Objectors, including former and current venue staff, have cited ""loss of cultural output"" as a key factor.
But the council's cabinet has given the green light in principle to the plan.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales at the weekend, Labour council leader Huw Thomas said private sector deals are a tool which local authorities need to utilise in order to save services.
""If it allows us to protect not only that service, but in turn other services, then it is incumbent on us, I believe, to consider those options,"" he said.
Outlining the plans on its website, the council said that AMG ""has a good track record of looking after important local heritage buildings across the UK"" and the takeover will mean the council does not have to spend the current £1m per year on maintaining and operating the venue.
AMG, which wants to offer rock and pop genres in the city centre venue, aims to install retractable seating.
uncil added that the agreement includes a minimum of 85 days set aside for classical music programming, including BBC Cardiff Singer of the World, the Welsh Proms, and national and local youth ensembles.
will be carried out ""without subsidy from the council"" and proposed installation of removable seating will ""have no effect"" on the hall's acoustics. 
Some have accused Cardiff council of seeking a ""quick fix"", after Labour councillors voted down a Liberal Democrat motion to hold a consultation specifically on the AMG proposals for the hall.
Instead, the authority has opted to include the future of the venue - and the AMG plan, now agreed in principle - in its overall budget consultation before it is officially agreed in March.
Catrin Finch, a former royal harpist who has played at the hall since she was a child, said for her the debate was part of a wider question about how we value the arts.
""I really feel we need to think beyond the quick fix solution because it would be a travesty in 30, 40, 50 years' time that we don't have a platform here for an orchestra or for classical music events here in Wales."""	/news/uk-wales-63991938
entertainment	Rosie Cooper: MP at centre of murder plot criticises 'stupid' ITV drama	"A Labour MP who was the target of a far-right murder plot has delivered a stinging criticism of ITV over a drama about how the plan was foiled.
Rosie Cooper told the House of Commons she had been ""used as a marketing tool"" for five-part series The Walk-In.
Referring to previous death threats, she said: ""How many more will come from this stupid, stupid, stupid series?""
ITV said the show was ""overwhelmingly in the public interest"" and had been made ""carefully and responsibly"".
rama, which started last month, stars Stephen Graham as former National Front member-turned-Hope Not Hate activist Matthew Collins, who got a tip-off in 2017 about the threat to Ms Cooper.
rrest and jailing of a neo-Nazi who had bought a machete to kill the West Lancashire MP.
Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Ms Cooper said: ""I'm appalled at ITV's recent treatment of the threats to MPs. I've been used as a marketing tool by both Hope Not Hate and ITV.
""What excuse is there for a press release that says, 'Who is Rosie Cooper and who wanted to murder her'? There is no defence to that.""
ITV, which also broadcast a documentary about the real story on Monday, said it was ""very sympathetic to the horrific ordeal Rosie Cooper MP has experienced"".
""But we'd like to point out that this has never been the emphasis of our press and marketing around the series, The Walk-In. The series has never been described in this way in any ITV press release."" 
However, an explainer link on the ITV website titled ""Who is Rosie Cooper and who wanted to murder her?"" is still live.
'An important story'
In the Commons, Ms Cooper requested that ITV and Hope Not Hate donate ""all monies and profits"" from the series to the Jo Cox Foundation, set up following the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016.
Ms Cooper said she had received numerous threats, ""all piggybacking on the original threat"", adding: ""In fact, there is one case with the Director of Public Prosecutions right now. And how many more will come from this stupid, stupid, stupid series?""
She also recalled how she had been granted a government car at the end of one related trial at the Old Bailey because ""ITV's despicable cameraman chased me up and down the road"".
In its statement, ITV said: ""From Hillsborough, Bloody Sunday, Appropriate Adult, Little Boy Blue and A Confession to The Lost Honour of Christopher Jeffries, ITV has a long record of broadcasting factual dramas based on or representing real events. 
""Like these, The Walk-In is an important story which we believe it is overwhelmingly in the public interest to broadcast. We always conduct the making of these series carefully and responsibly.""
A Hope Not Hate spokesperson said: ""We sympathise with Rosie Cooper for everything she has been through in recent years. No-one should endure murder threats simply for doing their job.
""Clearly, we are disappointed to hear Rosie's words in the chamber today. In 2017, several members of our organisation worked tirelessly and at tremendous sacrifice to themselves to foil the murder plot against Rosie Cooper.
""This ITV drama and documentary highlight the very real danger of far-right extremism - especially for those in public life. 
""Since the broadcast, we've had several current and former members of the organised far right get in touch to seek support leaving the far right as well as concerned members of the public who have asked for support for family members who have been radicalised.
""We cannot change what has happened to Rosie Cooper but we can continue to work to tackle far-right extremism.""
Ms Cooper's comments came after the Conservative chair of the Foreign Affairs committee raised the issue with the the Commons Speaker.
Alicia Kearns said: ""ITV has made a drama series about the heinous plan to murder the honourable lady for West Lancashire, whose permission I have to make this point of order.
""What advice can you give to members in this situation to ensure that the facts are fairly presented, that threats on the lives of our colleagues are not treated as entertainment... and that these series do not risk re-victimising those of us still living under significant threat from life?""
Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, replied that the safety of MPs, their families and staff was ""one of my highest priorities"".
""Like all members of this House, however, I would have thought that any depiction of threats made against parliamentarians is undertaken responsibly based on the facts and mindful of the impact of those subject to those such threats.""
He added that ""we all stand in awe of the bravery"" that Ms Cooper had shown.
She recently said she was standing down as an MP, explaining that ""events I have faced have taken their toll""."	/news/entertainment-arts-63487213

Raymond Allen, who lived on the Isle of Wight, created the hapless character of Frank Spencer, immortalised by actor Michael Crawford.
m ran from 1973, attracting audiences of up to 20 million.
Michael Crawford paid tribute to Mr Allen as a ""one-off"". His family said he had given ""joy and laughter to many millions of people"".
Mr Allen wrote a total of 22 episodes of Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em featuring the well-meaning and utterly accident-prone Frank Spencer who became one of the best-known characters of British TV comedy.
It was renowned for its heart-stopping stunts - all performed by Crawford himself. 
Speaking on a BBC documentary in 2016, Mr Allen recalled finding out his script had been commissioned while working as a cinema cleaner in Ryde.
""I'd been writing for 16 years, all I got was rejection slips,"" he said. 
""I was mopping the ladies loos and remembered I had a letter from the BBC in my pocket. It said, 'We'd like you to come to London to work for us'. I was so excited.
""I rushed and told the other cleaners. They looked at me and one said said, 'I cant understand that - you'd think they'd have their own cleaners'.""
He described Frank Spencer as ""a sort of loser - he was totally incompetent, very childlike"".
During his career Mr Allen also wrote scripts for other comedy stars, including Frankie Howerd and Dave Allen.
Mr Allen's family said he died peacefully on Sunday following a short illness.
""His life's work gave joy and laughter to many millions of people not just in this country but all around the world,"" a statement said. 
""Raymond has left us all with wonderful memories filled with fun, laughter and love.""
Michael Crawford posted a tribute on Twitter, describing his writing as ""the epitome of innocence and naivety"". 
""He gave me, as Frank, the most wonderful dialogue to perform, we travelled a very long journey together,"" he said.
""Ray was a 'one off' for sure and still people watch 'Some Mothers...'  with their great-grandchildren. Farewell, lovely man and thank you.""

Steven Spielberg's personal movie The Fabelmans, about how he developed his love of film, is a drama frontrunner, up against movies including the Avatar sequel and Baz Luhrmann's rock-and-roll biopic Elvis.
Organisers of the film and TV awards are attempting to rebuild its reputation after A-listers and studios boycotted last year's event over voters' lack of diversity, alleged corruption and lack of professionalism.
Brendan Fraser, who is nominated for best actor for The Whale, said last month he would not attend next year's Globes ceremony after accusing their former president of assaulting him.
In 2018, he said Philip Berk, head of Golden Globes organising body the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), had groped his bottom in 2003. Mr Berk was expelled from the troubled organisation in 2021 after sharing an article describing Black Lives Matter as a ""racist hate group"".
Cruise was also among the big names to criticise the awards, and in 2021 he handed back his three Golden Globes in protest at its lack of diversity. 
Scarlett Johansson had urged others in the film industry to boycott the organisation unless it made significant internal changes, while her Avengers co-star Mark Ruffalo wrote last year that the HFPA's reforms were ""discouraging"".
wards' organisers have since embarked on a series of public reforms, including expanding its voting body to include people with more diverse backgrounds.
Empire of Light sees Olivia Colman receive a nomination for best actress in a film drama and she will go up against international stars including the US's Viola Davis for The Woman King, and Cate Blanchett for Tár.
Blanchett's fellow Australian Hugh Jackman is up for best actor in a drama for The Son, about a family struggling to reunite.
Other British stars up for Golden Globes include Dame Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Lesley Manville, Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan.
Eddie Redmayne, Emma D'Arcy, Imelda Staunton, Jonathan Pryce, Lily James, Taron Egerton and Daisy Edgar-Jones also featured on Monday's nominations list.
ABC mockumentary sitcom Abbot Elementary, based in a school in Philadelphia, leads the TV nominations with five.
Netflix's drama about serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, which attracted huge viewing figures but also criticism from people who say it's insensitive, was recognised four times, alongside Pam & Tommy and The Crown.
reaming giant recently added a disclaimer to its marketing for the regal drama, saying the show was a ""fictional dramatisation"", ""inspired by real-life events"".
Globes are usually the highest-profile awards except the Oscars, but the 2022 event took place behind closed doors.
V network NBC dropped it after a series of revelations, but the broadcaster is going to screen the glitzy event next year, as it takes place in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles on 10 January.
wenty-one new members joined the HFPA last year, six of whom are black, and the organisation has also taken on more than 100 new voters, including - for the first time - those based outside of the US.
It has also implemented a ban on members receiving gifts from movie studios courting their votes.
""This is really not the old HFPA anymore,"" president Helen Hoehne recently told The Hollywood Reporter.
""I respect Brendan Fraser's decision,"" she added. ""And I personally, sincerely hope there's a way for us to move forward and we are able to regain Mr Fraser's trust, along with the trust of the entire entertainment community.""
Why do the Golden Globes matter?
Even before last year's controversy, that hasn't been a straightforward question to answer. The short, slightly blunt response is probably - because audiences and film industry personnel have decided that they matter.
But why that assessment has been made is a little trickier. 
When it comes to the Oscars and the Baftas, those awards are decided people by working in the entertainment industry. The Globes is a relatively small group of journalists who've come to wield huge power in awards season.
So why is it that it's they, rather than say the New York or LA Film Critics Association, who have traditionally been seen as an important stepping stone for Oscar hopefuls?
It's arguably not because they're seen as possessing more insight or expertise than other groups of journalists handing out awards. Indeed, over the decades they've been righty criticised for some of their more eccentric choices.
However, the most important factor in helping the Globes achieve its profile has probably been its TV deal. A large audience on a network TV ceremony in the US in the run-up to the Oscars has given films a huge opportunity to fix in the eyes of both the public and awards voters the idea that they're of exceptional quality.
When hundreds of films are entered for the Oscars each year, most voters will never have the time to see even the majority of the films. But a nomination or win at the Globes makes it more likely that a voter will pick that film or performances out and prioritise watching it when they're making their voting choices.
And that's what's helped make the Globes one of Hollywood's most golden awards ceremonies."	/news/entertainment-arts-63947647

entertainment	Designer Jenny Beavan speaks out on 'extraordinary' Hollywood gender pay gap	"Oscar-winning designer Jenny Beavan has said gender bias is behind an ""extraordinary"" pay gap between costume designers and male-dominated jobs on films and TV shows.
""I think it's because we're mainly women,"" said the British designer, who won her third Oscar earlier this year.
rate for TV designers was lower than ""the man who brings your tea and your breakfast muffin"", she said.
She had the words ""Naked without us"" written on one sleeve at the Oscars.
's the slogan of a campaign by the US Costume Designers Guild for fairer pay. 
Beavan told BBC Radio 4's Front Row that costume designers, who are roughly 80% female, are paid 30% less than production designers, who create the sets and are predominately male.
Figures from the Costume Designers Guild show that its members are towards the bottom of the film crew pay scale, with a film costume designer below an assistant lighting technician, a prop assistant and a set grip.
roved basic weekly rate for a costume designer's film work is $3,139.86 (£2,800), compared with $4,102.70 (£3,660) for a production designer.
A TV costume designer gets a basic rate of $2,952.11 (£2,640) a week, below someone working in ""craft services"" - who usually provide food to the crew while they are working.
Jenny Beavan has already won a Bafta for her work on Mad Max: Fury Road and could now win the Oscar for costume design
Beavan is one of the UK's most successful figures behind the scenes in Hollywood, winning her Oscars for A Room with a View, Mad Max: Fury Road and Cruella.
She has had another eight nominations, for films like The King's Speech, Gosford Park and The Remains of the Day.
""Our basic scale rates are incredibly low, compared to even craft service, which is the man who brings the your tea and your breakfast muffin, [who] is paid more than a basic scale TV costume designer in America. That's just extraordinary,"" she said.
""And we're way down, us film lot, even though we do quite a demanding and necessary job.""
re has been a drive for fairer pay on screen in recent years after revelations that some male actors were being paid much more than their female co-stars. But Beavan suggested that had not yet filtered through to behind-the-scenes roles.
She also said costume designers see no cut when their creations are sold as merchandise or fashion ranges, as happened with Cruella.
""It was, to my eyes, disrespect,"" she said. ""As costume designers, we tend to produce the things that can be most easily merchandised, be it Halloween costumes, be it all sorts of articles of clothing that people like.
""But we very rarely see any even collaboration with the people who are doing the merchandising.""
rights to the designs are owned by the film studios. ""You sign your life away, basically,"" she said.
Disney, which made Cruella, did not respond to a request for comment.

entertainment	Mark Owen on the Take That songs he avoids playing	"Sunday, Mark Owen will set off on a solo tour of the UK - the first time he's taken to the road without his Take That bandmates in almost a decade.
r says his shows will be a ""celebration of my whole career"" as he turns 50, looking back at his boy band beginnings, the hippy psychedelia of his solo debut album, and even his ""Tom Waits phase"" in 2013.
But there are some Take That songs he's scared of putting on the setlist.
""I couldn't play Sure, because I'd have to do the dance moves,"" he laughs. 
""It's the same thing with Pray. As soon as I hear Pray, my arms go up to the side,"" he says, involuntarily doing the choreography as he speaks.
""They come together, the moves and the songs. So I couldn't do them.""
Owen is speaking backstage at July's Latitude Festival where, it's true, Sure and Pray are missing in action.
If his performance at Henham Park is anything to go by, his headline shows are more likely to include latter-day Take That classics like Shine, Rule The World and These Days.
Not without coincidence, they're all songs where Owen has a writing credit. (In the band's early days, Gary Barlow was the self-imposed writer-in-chief, but they became more collaborative in their second incarnation.)
""There was a point in my career where I thought, oh, I can't do Take That songs [live],"" he says. ""But then, when I think about it, I'm like, I can, because I wrote on them. It's all right.""
Owen's tour comes hot on the heels of his fifth solo album, Land Of Dreams, which last month became his highest-charting record to date, entering the UK Top 40 at number five.
From the breezy, lovestruck stroll of Jenny to the smouldering fireworks of Rio, it's a sugar-coated love letter to the pop classics he grew up on. 
r says the album was written after the pandemic rekindled his passion for live music.
Owen moved to Los Angeles in 2019, immediately after Take That's Odyssey tour - and just in time for Covid to trap him in a city he barely knew. 
""We turned up and then LA closed,"" he recalls.
As life started to return to normal, he booked a night out at LA's famous open-air amphitheatre, the Hollywood Bowl. Then another, and another, and another.
""I was going online, booking my tickets, getting in the car, waiting outside for two-and-a-half hours, getting my slice of pizza, sitting in the audience. It was fab.""
He even ended up at the Coachella festival, where he and daughter Willow danced with Stormzy during rapper Dave's set.
""That was a highlight for her,"" he grins. ""But we saw as much as we could... Maggie Rogers, Phoebe Bridgers, Billie Eilish, Harry Styles.""
Becoming an audience member for the first time in 30 years was ""really inspiring"", the singer says. 
""Just to see the bits where everybody jumps up and down was fab. It made me want to get back up on stage again.""
's why Land Of Dreams is built to be played live. Magic's squealing guitar solo begs to be heard at 110 decibels, while You Only Want Me boasts a chorus that's stickier than a velcro jumpsuit.
rics to the latter initially seem to be about the cost of fame: ""You only want me for my good looks.""
But there's an ego-destroying pay-off that can only have been written by the father of teenage children.
""You only want me when you want a ride home.""
""That's the main bit, that's the reality!"" Owen laughs. ""What's that TikTok trend? What it could be versus what it is. The dream compared to the reality.""
Owen wrote the song towards the end of sessions for his album, envisioning it as the perfect set-opener.
""I wanted to have something that forced me to come out with jazz hands,"" he says. ""I couldn't look at my shoes and perform it. It made me have to step forward.""
Fans won't be surprised that the musician, who was always the sensitive heart of Take That, sometimes struggles to be an extrovert. 
It was, after all, his cherubic vulnerability that made millions of girls swoon in the 1990s. And his solo material has always been more maudlin than Take That's uplifting pop, full of lyrics about lost innocence, personal inadequacies and, on Four Minute Warning, the actual end of the world.
His new record is no different. Being Human is a loving portrayal of someone (presumably his wife, Emma Ferguson) who ""always makes it look so simple"" while he struggles.
Rio even mentions the cost of living crisis - something the multi-millionaire doesn't have to contend with, but the gesture is nice, all the same.
He hints at having even darker, more personal material that was discarded after the pandemic. 
""I wrote a lot of songs, most of which you won't hear,"" he says. ""They're the songs I worked through to get to something like You Only Want Me. 
""For where I was in my life, I turned 50 this year, I wanted songs that felt really positive and felt like my life was moving forward.
""My thought process is, I've probably got two more albums in me, maybe, if all goes well. Maybe another Take That record or two. But I'm at that stage where I'm not looking ahead and going, 'Yeah, in 20 years, I can reach that point.'
""I want to do it now and enjoy it and really go for it. Not in five years' time.""
And while Take That are currently on hiatus, they will appear on the silver screen next year in a musical based on their songs.
Greatest Days, which will star Aisling Bea, Jayde Adams and Amaka Okafor, among others, follows five best friends who reunite 25 years after having the night of their lives at a boy band concert.
While the group will be modelled on Take That, the actual members only make a brief cameo.
""We're the backdrop to the girls' lives, so we only have, like, two scenes,"" Owen confirms. 
""We went to Athens to film our bits, then the next day we went to Cannes to announce the movie's coming in spring - and it was the same day Tom Cruise was there, so it was packed.""
And once the movie is in cinemas, Owen wants Take That to hit the road again...  especially if Emily Eavis, who runs a different festival, puts in a call.
""I would love for us as a band to do Glastonbury,"" he beams. ""I've been to Glasto as a fan maybe four times. I loved watching [Paul] McCartney this year. So it'd be nice to go back and combine play and work. 
""Maybe hire a caravan and then come out on Sunday and do a gig, then go back home in the caravan. Yeah, I'd love it."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63121688
entertainment	Swansea: Band return to club frozen in time from 1980s	"When one rock band last played a city nightclub 34 years ago it looked… well, almost identical to how it does today.
Because for some unknown reason, when the doors of Swansea's Cavalier nightclub closed in 1988, it was left entirely untouched to the present day.
Earlier this month workers found half-full drink bottles, menus, DJ equipment and cigarette packets left abandoned.
Members of the Swansea band By Appointment have now returned to visit the ""spooky"" time capsule. 
Bassist Craig ""Lewi"" Lewis and drummer Nigel ""Mugs"" Morgan played the venue many times during the 1980s before the bookings stopped coming. 
""Obviously we found out eventually that it had closed down, but we had plenty of other gigs so we never really looked into the details,"" said Mugs. 
Lewi added: ""I heard something from my agent that the two brothers who owned it might have had licensing issues around exits and fire regulations.
""But that doesn't explain why it was left exactly as it must have been when they closed up on their last night. 
""To me that suggests they must have left in one hell of a hurry - it's all a bit spooky really.""
ghtclub, located above a former British Home Stores shop, was discovered by workmen who were turning the site into a community hub.
Among the undisturbed scene are bottles of Corona lemonade and sweet vermouth Martini Rosso on the bar, both half-full, as well as a jar of cocktail cherries. 
re is also a bar menu offering spaghetti bolognaise, cottage pie or faggots and peas for just £1.50 each.
A poster still hangs publicising which horseracing fixtures are due at Bangor, Hereford, Ludlow and Worcester in 1988, alongside period beer mats and a smashed mirror ball.
écor has a distinct ""Flintstones"" cavernous vibe, adorned with chicken wire and concrete palm trees. 
re derelict Oxford Street shopping unit has been purchased by Swansea council. It will house a new community hub as part of the council's £1bn regeneration programme.
Due to open in early 2024, the hub will be the new home for the central library, West Glamorgan Archives and several other public-facing services.
Swansea council cabinet member Elliott King said: ""It's exciting that our efforts to repurpose a building to play a key role in the city's future have also reminded us of the recent past.
""Nobody knew what to expect when we went in to start our preliminary surveys, but it certainly wasn't this.
""It's possible that shops used the former Cavalier as a storage area, but why the bar was left untouched is a mystery.
""Some of my cabinet colleagues have vague recollections of who owned and managed the bar - but I'd be really interested for the people of Swansea to let us have their memories using #SwanseaCavalier on social media.""
units were hurriedly constructed during the 1950s to replace the shops destroyed when Swansea was bombed by the Nazis in 1941.
While chain stores occupied the ground floor, upper floors were frequently let out to other businesses.
In the early 1970s the predecessor to the Cavalier opened as the Penthouse Club, and was said to be Swansea's only upmarket nightspot of the time.
However, As Mugs explained, when the Penthouse became the Cavalier Club around 1980, it catered for a very different clientele.
""It was rough - even the rats used to wear overalls in there - and the bouncers were brutal,"" he said. 
""The first time we played there in 1984 we had a guitarist  - he could only have been around 15 and his guitar case was almost the same height as him. 
""The doormen threatened to chuck him back down the stairs unless we got him out of there.""
And the punters weren't very well behaved either, Lewi recalled.
""We'd done a pretty good set - Bowie, The Cult, Lou Reed and some of our own stuff - and we were having a beer in the office, laughing at the band after we got pelted with bottles… until we realised our own guitars were still out on the stage.
""We had to dodge the missiles while we crawled back out there to retrieve them… it was like something out of The Blues Brothers.""
For Lewi, in particular, the visit proved highly emotional after he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis three years ago. 
""I've been a performer all my life. First in bands and latterly as a magician, but now I no longer have the slight of hand for magic, and I even struggle to bang out a tune on the guitar these days,"" said Lewi.
""But worse than the physical side of MS is the effect it's had on my memory. Before today I was stumped as to what songs we even used to play, but coming back here has made it all flood back.""
Mr King said the council will consider the future of the material discovered.
He said: ""Living memory is hugely relevant to our commitment to future generations.
""Key material will be preserved, documented and made available as part of our responsibility to provide access to local history all for our communities.""  "	/news/uk-wales-63315679
entertainment	Salford mayor's plea for help to buy Lowry painting for public	"A mayor has written to prominent local figures and business leaders asking for help to buy a Lowry painting valued at £8m so it can remain on public display.
Players Foundation (PF), the Professional Footballers' Association charity, intends to auction LS Lowry's Going To The Match in October.
It had previously loaned the 1953 work to Salford's Lowry arts centre.
In the letter, Salford Mayor Paul Dennett said he wanted to save the ""critically important"" painting. 
""If we save this painting, it will not sit idly in any basements out of view - or even static in a gallery,"" he said. 
""We will take the work around the country and beyond - and the story of how it was kept for the public will become part of its legacy.""
Salford Council said the letter had been sent to the leaders of the nine other Greater Manchester councils, the region's mayor Andy Burnham and a number of other prominent local figures, including former footballer and Salford City FC co-owner Gary Neville and bookmaker Fred Done.
In the letter, Mr Dennett said: ""All this at a time of unprecedented energy costs and high inflation, which has significantly impacted revenue and capital budgets across the entirety of local government. 
""In short, we cannot do this alone!
""But together with others, I believe we can preserve this iconic piece of L.S. Lowry's work, with a commitment to keeping it free to access for people in Salford, Greater Manchester and beyond.""
PF said the financial crisis meant it had to sell ""in the interests of our beneficiaries"" as it ""no longer has any income guaranteed, so we have had to completely reposition"".
Lowry, who died in 1976, spent much of his life in Salford and his work is strongly associated with the city.
Going To The Match is one of several football subjects painted by Lowry, who was always keenly interested in sport.
Many of the pictures have either direct or imaginary links with Burnden Park, the then-home of Bolton Wanderers, which was only a few miles from where the artist lived.
It won Lowry first prize in a 1953 exhibition, which was sponsored by The Football Association, and was last auctioned in 1999, when it was acquired by the charity for about £2m.
work will be sold at Christie's in London on 19 October.

Photographer Alexander Ward is behind the Apex exhibition at Suffolk Aviation Heritage Museum in Kesgrave.
""Some people I spoke to had just seen a light in the sky, but others had really significant and sometimes traumatic experiences,"" he said.
Mr Ward has been interested in the subject since he was a teenager when he had his own potential alien encounter.
""I saw a triangle in the sky when I was 17 and living in Essex. I've always been open to the subject, but I didn't want to steer this project in one way or another.
""I want people who come along to the exhibition to make up their own minds,"" he said.
Mr Ward said he wanted to tell the human experiences behind the strange encounters, rather than proving or disproving them. 
""I really wanted to understand how people had these experiences and how it changed their view of the world. I wanted to do their experiences justice,"" he said.
He spent a lot of time reassuring his subjects that he was not intending to make fun of them.
""It was really hard getting into the communities and getting them to trust me to tell their story,"" he said.
""Many photographers have tried to make a mockery of this subject in the past, so a big part of it was gaining their trust.""
Mr Ward said the project had convinced him of the existence of extra-terrestrial life.
""We all have our lines in the sand in our mind of what we are prepared to believe in and this project has really shifted that.
""We are such a tiny grain of sand compared to the vastness of the universe and it would be very strange if we were on our own,"" he added.
xhibition is being held in an old cold war bunker at the aviation museum, which was involved in one of the most famous purported UFO sightings in history at Rendlesham forest.

median from Bolton took to Twitter on Saturday afternoon to tell fans he was ""absolutely blown away"" by the response to the tour. 
Kay, 49, will become the first entertainer to hold a residency at London's O2 arena. He will perform there once a month between December 2022 and February 2025.
His long-awaited return comes after many years out of the spotlight.
In 2010, the comedian set a world record with the most tickets sold for a stand-up comedy tour, after playing to more than 1.2 million people at 113 shows.
He had been due to go back on tour in 2017, but cancelled because of ""unforeseen family circumstances"".

Charnock, whose character suffered a stroke, later told the BBC's Daniel Rosney it had been ""overwhelming"" to see so many people share their similar experiences, following the powerful plotline.
Boy George presented the Yorkshire soap with the big final award of the night for best serial drama, quipping: ""I've been upstaged in my life by a few queens but never by a King.""
Segments of the show marked both the Queen's death - with many stars opting for black outfits on the night - and the war in Ukraine.
Morning presenters Willoughby and Schofield were recently backed by ITV bosses after they were accused of jumping the queue for the Queen's lying-in-state.
Accepting the award for best daytime show for a second year, Schofield said: ""Don't think we ever get complacent and please don't think we ever take this for granted.
""This means so much to us every year, especially this year.
""We have the most amazing team, I have the best friend,"" he added, in Willoughby's direction. ""We have the best boss.""
While some boos were heard around the arena, they soon died down once the famous pair were up on stage alongside their team.
""Thank you so much, this award means everything because it is voted by you, and I think This Morning has a very special relationship with you,"" Willoughby added. ""You make our show for us, you really do.""
Ukrainian broadcaster Timur Miroshnychenko thanked the UK for its continued support and said his country is ""looking forward"" to Eurovision 2023, which is being hosted in Liverpool because the 2022 winners are currently unable to host such an event.
UK's Eurovision star Sam Ryder got the night going with an energetic performance of his track Space Man, before a casually dressed Lewis Capaldi sang his new single, Forget Me.
But in between all that, things got political when consumer champion Martin Lewis won a new category for best expert.
Referencing the cost-of-living crisis, Lewis, who expressed surprised at having beaten Sir David Attenborough to the award, noted it ""has been a pretty horrible year, financially"".
""I mean, the energy crisis has been disastrous and left many people with terrible issues and mental health problems,"" he said.
""I'm afraid the next year, with the mortgage problem and the knock-on to rent, is going to be pretty bad.
""And you know what?"" Lewis added. ""We need somebody to get a grip on the economy and put things a little bit back.""
Soon after the ceremony, BBC News reported that chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had cut short his visit to the US for urgent talks in Downing Street, as pressure mounts on Prime Minister Liz Truss to U-turn over the mini-budget.
Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly beat the likes of Alison Hammond to bag their 21st consecutive presenting award, meaning the last time they didn't win it was in 2000, to Michael Barrymore.
winner of the rising star award on Thursday night, Coronation Street's Paddy Bever, who plays Max Turner, wasn't even born then.
Stephen Mulhern accepted the award on their behalf, saying: ""Full respect to these guys, 21 years on the trot!"" 
He then jokingly added his own name to the trophy, declaring: ""This baby is coming home with me.""
ward for best authored documentary went to Kate Garraway for a second year, as she continued to chronicle her family's life as her husband Derek Draper gets treated for coronavirus.
Flanked by her daughter Darcey, she thanked the film-makers for ""making a very difficult thing easier"" and dedicated the win to the nation's carers.
""We have a care crisis in our country but we don't have a crisis of love,"" declared Garraway, while confirming her husband was now back in hospital.
recognition award went to a slightly tearful Sir Lenny Henry, after the comedian, actor and Comic Relief fundraiser was praised by stars in a video for having paved the way for other black British artists.
""These awards are so long David Beckham is still queuing to get in"", he smiled, with his own nod to the royals.
Other winners on the night included After Life, Gogglebox and Peaky Blinders/Cillian Murphy, as well as Strictly Come Dancing.
Strictly champion Rose Ayling-Ellis, who wowed the nation last year with a dance dedicated to the experience of deaf people everywhere, said the show had helped to ""change people's perceptions"", as it won the talent show prize.

entertainment	Steve Wright signs off from BBC Radio 2 afternoon show	"Watch: Wright's plans after show? Lunch and a rest!
Steve Wright has signed off from his final daily BBC Radio 2 programme after 23 years as a fixture in the station's weekday schedules.
DJ delivered a heartfelt speech during the last edition of Steve Wright in the Afternoon on Friday.
He said: ""I want to say thank you to you for your appreciation, our dearest listener smashing and loyal, for all the reaction and all the nice words.""
He stressed that he was not retiring, and will keep his Sunday morning show.
Wright will also launch his Serious Jockin' podcast on 4 November, and will present special programmes on the station including for National Album Day on 15 October and at Christmas.
""Thank you if you've ever seen your way to listening to us over 23 years at any time,"" he told listeners. ""Thank you, thank you and thank you again.
""Corny though it sounds, I quite like the way that we've all helped each other get through some of our ongoing problems together - the pandemic, the financial downturns, the ups and downs of life in the UK. Sometimes it's been very difficult for everybody.
""[We] tried on this programme to bring just a little bit of light relief, a good genuine atmosphere, uplifting tunes, good conversation, a little bit of satire. We tried to make the show unique and just be good company. I can only hope that we've done that some of the time.
""I'm also really aware there are more things to think about than a radio show ending so I don't want to be too self indulgent. What I do want to do is celebrate the show's success and long run, and also mention that I'm not retiring!""
When the end of his ""big show"" was announced in July, the 68-year-old revealed that the head of Radio 2 had told him she wanted to do ""something different"" in his slot. He said: ""That's OK. I understand that.""
Former Radio 1 host Scott Mills will move into Radio 2's 14:00-16:00 slot later this year, with drivetime presenter Sara Cox's show extended to begin at 16:00 instead of the current 17:00.
In a statement on the Radio 2 website, Wright said: ""I know I've been extremely lucky to do this work and have never taken it for granted.""
He joked: ""There is no truth in the rumour I'm planning to open my own artisan bakery, and I've turned down twice the chance to open my own nail bar. So it's all good.
""Please do listen to Scott Mills and Sara Cox when they take over afternoons. They are both brilliant broadcasters and I truly wish them well when they start.""
Wright made his name on Radio 1 with the original incarnation of Steve Wright in the Afternoon from 1981, bringing energy, comedy and his trusty posse - and pioneering the ""zoo"" format on the UK airwaves.
He moved from afternoons to the breakfast slot from 1994 to 95 before joining Radio 2 the following year, initially on Saturday mornings before resurrecting Steve Wright in the Afternoon in 1999.
format included regular features including his ""factoids"" - listing quirky facts - and Friday's final episode included a series of special factoids about Steve Wright in the Afternoon.
Former Radio 1 colleague Nicky Campbell earlier paid tribute to Wright on his Radio 5 Live show, describing him as a ""proper genius"" of radio.
""Just to know him and to watch him work was extraordinary,"" Campbell said. ""He's a conjurer, he's a magician, he's a high wire artist, and he's a communicator extraordinaire. He is, I'll say it again, a radio genius, and he will always be a radio hero.""
Other friends and famous fans lined up to bid farewell to Wright's daily show."	/news/entertainment-arts-63088080
entertainment	Singer's career-making TikTok video sat unsent for days	"A singer says a video that went viral on TikTok and landed her a record deal had sat in her drafts for two days before she got round to posting it.
Katie Gregson-Macleod, from Inverness, uploaded a 45-second clip of the chorus to her song Complex in August.
It became an overnight sensation and the song has since been released as a single by a major record label.
Katie, 21, told BBC Radio Scotland the clip had resulted in 10 years' worth of progress in her music career.
ger-songwriter told The Afternoon Show: ""It's a bizarre thought that something so trivial in the moment can change your life so much.
""That video was in my drafts. I will often do that with a song, I will pop up it up a few days later because I fancy it. It wasn't any deeper than that.""
Overnight, the chorus to Complex amassed 100,000 views and garnered comments from musicians Gracie Abrams, Lennon Stella and Maisie Peters.
Shortly after, representatives from three record companies were sitting in the Inverness coffee shop where Katie worked, all hoping to convince her to sign with them.
She chose to go with Columbia Records.
Katie told The Afternoon Show she had thought her music career was going well before then, but what had happened since August was far more than she could ever have imagined.
Katie has been playing music since an early age and started songwriting when she was about 16.
She performed at the Belladrum Music Festival, near Beauly, in 2019 and released her debut single, Still a Sad Song, in July 2020. Within a week of its release, it was chosen as song of the week by BBC Radio Nan Gàidheal's Rapal programme.
Katie was also one of BBC Radio Scotland's 25 Artists to Watch in 2022.

On Monday night, Skelton, 39, from near Penrith, Cumbria, and dancing partner Gorka Márquez were put through to Saturday's final.
Her mother Janet Skelton said she knew she wanted to win it ""for the kids"".
Mrs Skelton said her ex-Blue Peter presenter daughter never did anything half-heartedly.
""I'm so proud, she's worked really hard,"" Mrs Skelton told BBC Radio Cumbria.
""It's been a great adventure for her and for us as a family.""
She said training for Strictly had given her daughter, now a BBC1 Countryfile and BBC 5 Live presenter, ""a lot more confidence"".
""When she first started she was very nervous and maybe wasn't in such a good place,"" said Mrs Skelton.
She added: ""If she does something, she does it 100%.
""She never does anything half-heartedly and gives it her best shot.
""She's not a bad loser in any shape or form, but to win it would be lovely for her and a great way to end the year, fingers crossed. 
Skelton was voted through to the final after scoring 37 for her Argentine tango and 35 for her waltz on Sunday night's semi-final show.
Will Mellor became the 11th celebrity on Monday to leave the competition.
r three couples through to the final are singer and radio DJ Fleur East and Vito Coppola, wildlife cameraman Hamza Yassin and Jowita Przystal and CBBC actor and singer Molly Rainford and Carlos Gu. 
Mrs Skelton said she was looking forward to Saturday's show when Helen and Gorka would be performing the jive - which they performed to Tightrope by Janelle Monáe in week seven - along with a new dance.
""She has developed over the weeks and thoroughly enjoyed it,"" Mrs Skelton added.
""It's given her something to focus on and we are just so proud of how she's coped with it because it is very intense.
""As Gorka said, they can train from 6 to 10 o'clock at night. It's a long spell, I couldn't learn half of those dances.""
After getting her final set of scores before the final, Skelton thanked viewers for their support.
She said: ""We have just been so overwhelmed - not just by the votes keeping us here - but the messages, people reach out and share things about their lives and that's a very privileged position to be in.
""If anyone has taken one moment of joy from any of our dances then we've all done our jobs.""

entertainment	Tilda Swinton: Cinema was a haven and a sanctuary	"Swinton can remember vividly her first cinema experience, as a child in London in the 1960s.
She used to go to the newsreels cinema at the Cameo Royal in Charing Cross Station.
""It was packed with emotion for my brothers and me,"" she says.
""It was where as children we caught the trains that took us to our boarding schools. The ritual was that tickets were bought, luggage was checked and we went to the pictures.
""It was a sort of sweetener. But it was also a haven, a sanctuary and a safe place.""
, she's internationally known as an actor and as a film maker. She won an Oscar for her role in Michael Clayton, as well as a string of awards for a range of roles across independent films like Grand Budapest Hotel and Marvel movies like Doctor Strange and Avengers: Endgame.
But it's lesser-known work which has earned her the latest honour. 
She received the annual award from the International Federation of Film Archives, a global organisation dedicated to the preservation of moving image heritage.
Swinton was recognised for her work on the preservation and promotion of archive film, film history and women's role in it.
Past winners of the award have included Ingmar Bergman, Mike Leigh and Geraldine Chaplin.
Swinton, who tries to visit archives wherever she's filming, was presented with the award in a ceremony at the National Library of Scotland at Kelvin Hall in Glasgow.
""It's difficult to describe what an honour this is,"" she said.
""I admire this body so much, not just as a film maker but as a film fan. We can't imagine new films without valuing old films.""
Film archive became an early passion, thanks to the film maker Derek Jarman. He cast her in Caravaggio in 1986, just as she was about to give up acting.
""I was never interested in acting or being an actor, but I was really interested in cinema,"" she told me.
""When I started out, in London, it was either television or cinema. It was all really big cinema, David Lean or big costume dramas by Merchant Ivory, and I knew I wasn't interested in working in that world.
""But Derek used a super eight camera. He pulled together a lot of young people like me, it was like a school. 
""We weren't frightened of film making. It was very simple. You didn't need big budgets or big names. It was a practical business.
""That was an important start for me and I've been following my nose ever since.""
After Jarman's death from AIDS in 1994, she was among those who collaborated on a film called Glitterball which used his archive to tell his story.
wo years ago, she spearheaded a campaign to raise £3m to buy Jarman's cottage in Dungeness and turn it into an artists' residency.
""If I hadn't met Derek, I wouldn't be performing and I'd probably have a job in an archive like this,"" added Swinton.
""I'd be making the tea for them. It's work I value.""
She still lives in Nairn, between film projects. She and her frequent collaborator, the film maker Mark Cousins, once dragged a mobile cinema across the Highlands in a bid to bring films to as many local communities as possible.
""It was a bit of an experiment, dragging this cinema alongside Loch Ness, through glens and towns. Bringing a programme of rare old foreign films, the sort you wouldn't necessarily watch on television. I'd like to do it again.""
Cinemas have been hit hard by the pandemic, and now the cost of living.
Rising bills and falling ticket sales have already forced some businesses, including the Filmhouse in Edinburgh and the Belmont in Aberdeen, into administration.
""One good thing about the pandemic was that it reminded the world of what was important,"" she said.
""They missed friends and family, travel, live music and going to the pictures. Even though they could watch television round the clock at home.
""The cost of living crisis is a different thing and we have to think very seriously about that. It's not a luxury, it's important to our culture and it's important to our mental health.""
She said cinemas were still needed.
""We need big screens - or small ones - and good sound systems,"" she said.
""The village I live in used to have two cinemas. A tiny village, but it had two cinemas. Most towns had at least two cinemas and a cultural vibrancy. 
""It isn't lost, but we have to be careful that we keep going to the pictures. It's not just about streaming. 
""You might love watching a film at the end of your bed, and that's fine. One can do both.""
She also believes that the Edinburgh International Film Festival, of which she is a patron, can survive.
""Honestly? In the long-term I'm not worried. Edinburgh International Film Festival is such a living spirit and such an old cultural force for good. 
""We're in a tight spot but people are rallying and we're going to find solutions.
""We may have to project films against outside walls, or drag a mobile cinema around but there's no question in my mind.
""The Edinburgh International Film Festival will just have to transform for the time being and eventually land in a new incarnation."""	/news/uk-scotland-63793876

entertainment	John Legend interview: The pain of losing a child will never go away	"What do you think of, when you think of John Legend? 
me, he's the Kanye West protégé who made good. To others, he's a Hollywood player, with credits on films like La La Land and Selma.
Some will know he is the youngest ever (and first black American male) EGOT winner, earning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award.
But Legend is probably best-known for his ballads... and one ballad in particular. 
All Of Me, a swoonsome tribute to his wife, the model and chef Chrissy Teigen, has sold 3.6 million copies in the UK. On Spotify, and is approaching its 2 billionth play.
Legend knows the success has pigeon-holed him.
""For a casual listener, they probably think I'm just a balladeer,"" he says. ""My albums have always had a hip-hop influence - but the ballads are the ones that have grabbed people by their hearts.
""When I was a management consultant, we used to call it a 'competitive advantage'. There's certain things a company does that they're better at than anybody else. And I think ballads are my competitive advantage.""
Legend had always been an over-achiever. 
Born John Roger Stephens in Ohio, he began playing piano at the age of four, and was a spelling bee champion by 10. At school, he was so academically gifted that he skipped two grades, and left home at 16 to study English at the University of Pennsylvania.
re, he became president of the university a-capella group, and was tapped by Lauryn Hill to play on her hit single Everything Is Everything.
He assumed he was on the path to stardom, but he was wrong... at least for a couple of years.
""There was a lot of rejection."" he says, ""but if I'd got a record deal at 18, I would have screwed it up"".
""I didn't know what went into being a successful solo artist. I just thought, 'Oh, I can sing and I'm writing some decent songs,' but there's more to it than that. 
""I'm a coach on The Voice now and that's something I'm always thinking about when I'm advising the artists. They're all really good singers - some of them are much better singers than I am - but the only way for them to make it is to have a point of view that's interesting and distinct and personal. 
""Music is not just a virtuosity competition.""
rly rejections explain how Legend spent three years as a management consultant, first in Boston, then in New York. 
""It's a demanding job, they expect you to work a decent number of hours,"" he recalls, ""but I was living a double life, writing at night, gigging at night. 
""People always ask me if I get tired now and I'm like, 'I get way more rest than I used to!'""
It was in New York that an old roommate first introduced him to Kanye West, then an up-and-coming artist himself.
mmediately hit it off: West employed Legend to sing hooks on his demos, In return, he gave the musician beats for his songs.
One of their collaborators, the poet J Ivy, noted that John's smooth, elastic vocals sounded ""like one of the legends"" - and West immediately rechristened his partner John Legend.
At first, he was hesitant to adopt the name. ""I was like, 'Damn, what if I flop?' 
""And then my response to myself was, 'No, you're not going to flop. Bet on yourself. Go for it.'
""I call it audacity. Kanye certainly had it, and has it. I think every successful artist has to have some audacity - to believe that what you have to offer to the world is unique and special, and deserves to be heard.""
West's first album, The College Dropout, arrived in 2004, with Legend featuring on seven tracks. By the end of the year Legend's own debut, Get Lifted, came out on West's GOOD Music label.
""The timing was exactly right,"" he reflects. ""The fact it happened after the College Dropout set me up perfectly.""
He's never looked back. He won the best new artist Grammy in 2006, scored his first platinum single with the 2008 shoe-shuffler Green Light, and in 2010 recorded a searing covers album full of still-relevant protest songs, called Wake Up.
He met Teigen on a video set and proposed at Christmas 2011 during a trip to the Maldives (the surprise was nearly ruined when airport security demanded to search his bag). 
When he first played her All Of Me, she burst into tears... and his music still has the power to move her today.
His new album, simply titled Legend, delicately dedicates two songs to Teigen and the baby she lost in 2020 as the result of a pregnancy complication.
uple had already named the unborn child Jack when it became apparent he would not survive. Teigen's life was also in danger. Diagnosed with partial placental abruption - where the placenta comes away from the inner wall of the womb - she was continually losing blood despite ""bags and bags of transfusions"".
Eventually, the couple made the ""difficult and heartbreaking"" decision to end the pregnancy. 
""That pain is never going to completely go away,"" Legend says. ""You're never exactly the same after you lose someone.""
Part of the healing process was a song called Stardust, in which Legend lifts up his wife, celebrating her strength and spirit despite their devastating loss.
""That was one of the earliest songs I wrote for the album, in the aftermath of losing our pregnancy, and it was really meaningful for Chrissy - because it was therapeutic after going through what we went through,"" he says.
Another song, Pieces, is a raw but graceful piano ballad about navigating unimaginable grief. 
""The only thing you can do is pick up the pieces,"" sings Legend. ""Let your broken heart learn to live in pieces"".
""That whole section of the [album] is really about healing,"" he says. ""It's about figuring out a way to survive through your grief and remembering what you mean to the people that love you, and who you love.""
Legend says he and Teigen found their way through the darkness by focusing on their first two children, Luna and Miles.
""To have two little ones that we could dote on and nurture and enjoy... They bring us so much joy. 
""We just were able to hold each other through what was a very tough time.""
gen recently announced that she was pregnant again, after ""one billion shots"" of IVF - but Legend says the excitement is tempered by their previous experience.
""There's always this sense of cautious optimism, because you know what it's like to lose one,"" he says. ""And I think that's kind of the message of Pieces: You'll never forget that pain, but you'll find ways to keep going.""
Stardust and Pieces are just two of 24 tracks on Legend's epic eighth album. 
Arranged over two discs, it's frontloaded with slinky dance tracks like Dope and All She Wanna Do Is Dance - on Strictly Come Dancing's launch show this week.
Splish Splash is another ode to Teigen that, to put it politely, celebrates their marital relations with a cunning linguistic approach.
What, I wonder, will their kids think?
""You know, I make my music for grown-ups,"" he laughs. ""But at some point, they'll figure out what it means and they'll probably be embarrassed by it.""
f of Legend settles into a more comfortable neo-soul groove, full of songs about the healing power of love. Wonder Woman is an sparkling standout; as is Good, a duet with Ledisi, whose jazzy harmonies put some spice in Legend's step.
""Yeah, we definitely did that,"" he smiles. ""Sometimes we make the chord rub a little more. There's a little more dissonance, and the notes are crowded up together, instead of being evenly spread out. It feels really cool.""
Reviewers have largely preferred the first disc. Rolling Stone said it was refreshing to see Legend shake off ""his usual supper-club decorum"", while Pitchfork noted that collaborators like Rick Ross and Jazmine Sullivan helped the star ""bring more fun to his music than he has in years"".
As J Ivy once observed, Legend's biggest skill is blending vintage and modern sounds - and this album contains traces of everyone from Prince and Marvin Gaye to Nina Simone and Nat King Cole, while the low-slung groove of You riffs on Curtis Mayfield's Diamond In The Back.
Does he worry about referencing his influences after the notorious Blurred Lines copyright trial - where Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were successfully sued for copying the ""feel"" of Marvin Gaye's Got To Give It Up?
""That was a terrible court decision,"" Legend says. ""Terrible for music. 
""It was not based on any real understanding of how songwriting works. Part of the creative process is having those influences and letting them inspire you to create something new. And if writers and producers aren't able to do that, then we're not really able to make music. 
""So I try not to let that creep into my head - but lawyers definitely let it creep in there, labels definitely let it creep in there. And I'm like, 'Leave me alone!'
""I don't want to re-adjudicate that case... but it was a mess of a decision.""
He pauses.
""My lawyers are gonna be so mad I talked about that.""
Legend is out now."	/news/entertainment-arts-62984480
entertainment	Dame Hilary Mantel: Rowling, Mosse and Evaristo lead tributes to late author	"Authors JK Rowling, Kate Mosse and Bernardine Evaristo have led the tributes to Dame Hilary Mantel, saying she changed the face of literature.
Dame Hilary, author of the best-selling Wolf Hall trilogy, died on Thursday aged 70, her publisher confirmed.
She won the Booker Prize twice, for 2009's Wolf Hall, the first in the Thomas Cromwell series, and its 2012 sequel Bring Up the Bodies.
""We've lost a genius,"" tweeted Harry Potter writer Rowling.
resident of the Royal Society of Literature, Evaristo said she was ""so sorry"" to hear the news and that she felt ""so lucky to have such a massive talent in our midst"". 
""I met her a few times and she was always so warm, down-to-earth and welcoming. RIP,"" the fellow Booker Prize-winning author said.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme, Labyrinth author and founder of the Women's Prize for Fiction, Kate Mosse, said Dame Hilary ""changed the face of how modern readers saw historical fiction"". 
""She was a very great writer... she kind of just had this exquisite way of capturing a place in a time within three sentences,"" Mosse said.
Pointing to her other, earlier works, Beyond Black and Everyday is Mother's Day, as well as her ""searing"" memoir, Giving Up the Ghost, Mosse went on to describe Dame Hilary as ""a writers' writer"" who ""became one of the most important readers [that] writers could have"". 
Mosse continued: ""The thing about Hilary Mantel was that she was a woman of extraordinary principle, she said what she thought, she wrote what she thought, she believed in the idea that your writing was your soul, if you like, out there.
""And she was unaffected by whether these views were popular or they were out of fashion, or she should do this or she should do that.""
Mosse concluded: ""She was a classic writer, but living in our modern times, and she will be remembered like George Eliot and [Charles] Dickens - I have no doubt that her works will never go out of print.""
Bill Hamilton, Dame Hilary's agent at literary agency A.M. Heath, told the same programme that her work, in both historical and contemporary fiction, always gave ""a sideways look, the sense always that the present was a place of complete uncertainty and danger that you never knew what was around the corner"".
""I think that sense of what lay in the Gothic, which was a kind of other universe lurking just slightly behind what you saw, infuses almost everything that she writes,"" he said.
I was lucky enough to interview Hilary Mantel many times.
I say lucky, because in person she was charming, polite and thoughtful.
On the page, however, she could be forthright, fierce and irreverent.
What strikes me most is the range of her work. From performing psychics in suburbia in Beyond Black, to an 18th Century Irish giant in The Giant and 800 pages on the French Revolution in A Place of Greater Safety. 
She was an intense and troubling writer and her subjects were odd and unpredictable. That made her work difficult to categorise and helps explain why she did not enjoy a wide readership until the success of Wolf Hall transformed her sales and profile.  
People loved the idea, she told me, that she had become ""an overnight success"".
But she confessed that made her ""feel a little bit sulky because I'd think, I've been writing since I was 22. I wrote for 12 years before I was published."" 
She leaves behind a body of work that I have no doubt will be read for years to come. 
fluential late author delivered the BBC Reith Lectures in 2017 and spoke herself about the power of art in bringing historical figures to life.
""As soon as we die, we enter into fiction,"" said Dame Hilary. ""Just ask two different family members to tell you about someone recently gone and you'll see what I mean.
""Once we can no longer speak for ourselves, we are interpreted. And when we remember, as psychologists so often tell us we don't reproduce the past, we create it.""
Dame Hilary's career-defining Wolf Hall was a fictional account of Thomas Cromwell's rise to power in the court of Henry VIII.
rd and final book in the series, The Mirror and the Light, was published in 2020 to much critical acclaim, became a fiction best-seller and was longlisted for The Booker Prize 2020.
rilogy sold more than five million copies globally and has been translated into 41 languages. 
Wolf Hall and its sequel Bring Up The Bodies were turned into a six-part BBC TV series starring Sir Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell, Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn.
wo books were also adapted for the stage and enjoyed a run in London's West End, as did a 2021 adaptation of the third novel in the trilogy, The Mirror and the Light.
Actor and playwright Ben Miles, who helped Dame Hilary bring her work to the stage, described her as ""an extraordinary woman"", as well as ""a good friend and a close colleague"".
""I feel so honoured to have known her and to have contributed in a small way to the work of one of the greatest writers of our time,"" he told the BBC on Friday. 
""I shall dearly miss her kindness, her humour and her gentle tenacity. The indisputable genius of her words remains as some small consolation to this tragic loss.""
Writing on Twitter, Author Damian Barr said: ""With every book she redefined what words can do. 
""She's the only person I ever interviewed that speaks in whole, flawless paragraphs. I can't believe we won't have another book from her. Thinking of her family and friends. Such a loss.""
Historian Simon Schama tweeted: ""Shattered to learn of death of Hilary Mantel - one of the very greatest of our writers; poetic and profound prose with an incomparable feel for the texture of history.""
Peter Kosminsky, who directed the BBC adaptation of Wolf Hall, told Radio 4's PM programme: ""It's a terrific shock.
""I can't help feeling that a light has gone out in our rather rather benighted country. Hilary Mantel was an expert, she spent five years researching Cromwell and the Tudor period before she even put pen to paper. She was erudite on a range of subjects.""
""For those who knew her, for her husband Gerald, and all those who adored her books, we're not going to see her like again in our lifetimes."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63005841
entertainment	Stephen Bear trial: Jury consider verdicts in sex tape trial	"A jury has retired to consider its verdicts in the case of a former reality TV contestant charged with offences linked to a sex tape.
Prosecutors allege Stephen Bear shared CCTV video of himself with Georgia Harrison, effectively selling it.
32-year-old, of Bryony Close, Loughton, Essex, denies voyeurism and two counts of disclosing private, sexual photographs and films.
Mr Bear has appeared in Celebrity Big Brother and The Only Way Is Essex.
fendant and Ms Harrison, 27, were recorded on CCTV in his garden in August 2020, a week-long trial at Chelmsford Crown Court heard. 
Prosecutors allege Ms Harrison, who has waived her right to anonymity, was unaware they were being recorded. 
Ms Harrison, who has also appeared on The Only Way Is Essex, Love Island and Olivia Meets Her Match, said that when Mr Bear showed her the footage she told him ""never to send"" it to anyone and ""made it plain how upset she would be if he did"", said Jacqueline Carey KC, prosecuting.
She told the court she had seen Mr Bear send the footage to someone on WhatsApp later that day and then later that year became aware it was circulating online. 
Ms Carey said that the defendant uploaded the footage ""either himself or had it uploaded to OnlyFans and profited financially"".
Mr Bear, who won Celebrity Big Brother in 2016, told his trail that he deleted the video in August 2020 and had not sent it to others.
Jurors have been sent home for the day and has been asked to return at 10:00 GMT on Tuesday to continue their deliberations.

entertainment	Microsoft founder's masterpieces on display ahead of blockbuster $1bn auction	"Masterpieces by some of art's most renowned painters have gone on display before what's expected to be the largest auction in history.
re collectively expected to fetch a record-breaking $1bn (£900m) at the sale in New York next month.
works belonged to Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, who died in 2018.
But while Allen often loaned out his treasures, some art critics fear the auction could lead the works to become hidden from public view for decades.
Paintings by Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon, Paul Cezanne and David Hockney feature in the collection, which is being auctioned by Christie's.
150 works will be on public display in the coming weeks at branches of Christie's worldwide, before being auctioned in New York on 9 and 10 November. 
Fourteen of the paintings will be on display in London this weekend, with other exhibitions set to take place in Paris, Los Angeles and Shanghai.
While some of the artists come up in auctions relatively often, Allen's collection features pieces that are considered some of the painters' masterpieces.  
Max Carter, head of impressionist and modern art at Christie's, described it as a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" auction.
""I don't think we've had anything like this in terms of masterpiece range across 500 years,"" he told BBC News. ""If you look at the top dozen or so works in the collection, each one of these objects would be a five-year or 10-year defining work if they were to come on the market on their own.""
He added: ""The art collecting was very personal [to Allen], in spite of the staggering range - it's 500 years from late 15th Century works by Botticelli through to works executed in the 2010s. 
""The common thread is this one man's vision. There was no advisor, this was something that he did himself, and buying at the highest levels, decisively and virtually without mistakes, which is something you very seldom see.""
works on display in London include: 
When he was alive, Allen often loaned his artworks to museums and touring exhibitions. ""He was very generous,"" said Giovanna Bertazzoni, co-chairman of Christie's impressionist and modern art department. ""He wasn't private or secluded with the collection. It was always an endeavour that he wanted to share.""
But some arts experts fear that the buyers may hang them on the walls of their homes and restrict them from public view. 
Melanie Gerlis, Financial Times columnist and editor-at-large of The Art Newspaper, said: ""It's always a bit painful to watch works that have been in museum shows - or indeed on long loan to collections - go into the private market, where they may not be seen again by the public.
""But the truth is that to buy work at these price levels is beyond the reach of museums, so they are always in some way reliant on the generosity of private, wealthy patrons. 
""I am sure though that many of the next owners the Allen works will be those who are accustomed to lending to museums - and frankly not just for charitable reasons. As most collectors know, a museum showing can greatly add to the value of the work that they own!""
Asked whether she was concerned that public access to the works could be limited, Ms Bertazzoni said: ""I have the same kind of hopes that they will end up in museums. Most of them will be competed for by museums, there are museums that can afford them and they will be in the game. 
""American collectors are all driven by donating, eventually, to the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art], to the MoMA [Museum of Modern Art]. It's part of the American tradition. So I really do hope that these works will go back to public fruition.""
money raised by the auction will be distributed between a variety of philanthropic causes Allen supported.
Allen was a conservationist, and his own foundation aimed to protect oceans and promote biodiversity. During his lifetime, he was also passionate about supporting education, the arts, wildlife, science and technology."	/news/entertainment-arts-63230643
entertainment	Peaky Blinders dance show: 'Anyone who likes Strictly can love this'	"""An independent dance company, dedicated to bringing dance to the people,"" declares Birmingham's best-known gangster Tommy Shelby in an episode from series five of the hit TV series Peaky Blinders.
mmy is hosting a lavish birthday dinner at his country pile for his wife Lizzie with guests including fascist leader Oswald Mosley.
gang leader introduces a performance of Swan Lake featuring dancers from renowned company Rambert, which captivates the majority of the audience but sends his brother and partner in crime Arthur to sleep.
Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight is confident no-one will be dozing off during his latest venture, a real-life dance show called Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby, again in collaboration with Rambert, but on a much bigger scale.
Having also worked with the London-based company on that TV episode and 2019's Peaky Blinders festival, Knight was keen to bring the dance experience to a new audience.
""I'm the least likely person to attend a dance show,"" he says. ""And yet the experience I've had watching rehearsals... is absolutely fantastic. I really want to get that message out there that if you think you don't like dance, come and see the show and you'll find out that you do. Anyone who likes Strictly can love this show.""
Knight explains that he wasn't a dance fan before Rambert got involved with the BBC TV series ""simply because I'd never been"", adding: ""It's like going to your first football match and you go 'oh wow, it's brilliant'.""
Dance critic Lyndsey Winship says it can be difficult to attract new audiences to dance because of preconceptions: ""So many people love to dance, or to watch dance on TV, but would never think of going to see a stage show. So something with a well-known title and story like Peaky Blinders is a good way of tempting them into the theatre. 
""In the popular imagination, dance is still so often associated with ballet and Swan Lake and fairy tales, but the contemporary dance scene is so much more than that, and it's great if people's eyes can be opened to that.""
roduction begins as a prequel with the Shelby boys fighting in the trenches during World War One, but then it ""takes us through into a very familiar story, and it's not giving too much away to say it's about Tommy and Grace"", Knight explains. The pair's tragic romance will already be familiar to fans of the TV show.
Rambert's artistic director Benoit Swan Pouffer is the creative lead behind the production and is keen to point out that his interpretation is not just focused on the machismo of the leading male characters.
""When the young men went to the war, who ran the world? Who was doing the labour and working? Women,"" he says. ""There's always a sense of that in the show. I wanted to put forward the strength of the woman as well. I have male and female and non-binary dancers.""
Much of the story is told through dance and staging with no dialogue other than some narration courtesy of Benjamin Zephaniah, who plays Jeremiah in the BBC One series. 
""It's a great challenge to try to tell a story without words. But fortunately, Benoit and Rambert are masters at it,"" Knight says. 
""And so what I did was put some things down on paper and then handed it over to Benoit, he's crafted it and changed it and made it what it is now.""
Pouffer adds that Knight ""was surprised that I asked him to write a script, but that was my blueprint. Once I had this it was easier to... create the show because I was anchored in a good way with his vision.""
I'm curious to know how challenging it was to cast such iconic characters that are known to millions, particularly Cillian Murphy's Tommy.
""It's not about the physical aspects… you really need to understand who those characters are,"" Pouffer tells me. 
""Who is Polly? Who is Jeremiah? Who is Arthur? Rambert is a company made up of individuals who can tell stories naturally and that was even before Peaky Blinders, so it was pretty easy to cast because I have strong personalities in the company. And it was very organic.
""Human beings are complex. Tommy Shelby is a complex man with a lot of layers of sensibility. He is not just a bandit. You understand the reason why he's acting that way, his struggle and his hurt,"" he continues.
""And through what Steven wrote us, it really pushes forward this dilemma that Tommy has in his head and in his life. Through the show, you will have this journey of understanding of what makes a Peaky Blinder and why Tommy Shelby has this redemption.""
Four young dancers from the company landed the lead roles - Seren Williams and Prince Lyons will share the parts of Tommy and Grace with Guillaume Queau and Naya Lovell.
Williams says: ""We're not necessarily copying and pasting what you see in the series, we're taking the mindset of the characters… and translating that into movement, so there's still similarities between them.""
Lyons adds: ""We have a lead who is a white male and I'm clearly not a white male!
""You are watching a different idea and it's kind of forcing you to view this world in a completely different light, the same way that a white Ariel [from The Little Mermaid] would look completely different to the new Ariel that's coming out. It's forcing you to use a bit of your imagination.
""The same way that if you were to read a book, if the author didn't fully describe what these characters look like, depending on who you are and who you grew up around, you make your own opinions based on what you've gone through and the culture around you.""
He adds: ""I just hope that audiences are able to view the beauty of our interpretation.""
Knight has three things he would like the audience to come away with.
""I want them to have had a fantastic evening. I want them to be quite emotional at the end of it. And for them to go away thinking dance is something that they enjoy.""
w opens in Birmingham later this month.
Knight smiles. ""It can't be anywhere else.""
Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby premieres at the Birmingham Hippodrome on 27 September followed by a run at Wembley Park ahead of a UK tour next year."	/news/entertainment-arts-62966638
entertainment	The family inspired by Ellie Simmonds on Strictly	"When the Davidson family sat down to watch Strictly last weekend, it was a watershed moment.
For the first time, Hailey and her daughter Skye saw someone like themselves on a prime time show.
me dwarfism as Strictly celebrity Ellie Simmonds.
And for Hailey, it was more than watching someone who has already inspired them to enjoy sport - it was representation.
Hailey, 43, said: ""It makes a huge difference, because we don't get to see ourselves very often, especially on something as big a scale as Strictly Come Dancing.
""You can see people on the Paralympics but here it's seven o'clock on Saturday night and we've got Ellie representing us. 
""It's hugely important.""
Ellie Simmonds is best known as a gold medal-winning Paralympic swimmer. At 13, she was the youngest British athlete at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, winning two gold medals. 
In 2012 Ellie added two golds at the London Games and she won her fifth in Rio 2016. The former BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year also boasts 14 World Championship titles.
Like Paralympian Ellie, Hailey, her daughter Skye, 12, and her son Finlay, 17, were born with achondroplasia, which stunts growth in arms and legs. 
And the family, from Inverkeithing in Fife, has already been influenced by her shining example.
Davidsons joined the Dwarf Sports Association (DSA) ten years ago.
Hailey helped develop the association in Scotland and both Skye and Finlay enjoyed training and competing in a range of sports including track and field, football, basketball, hockey, boccia, curling, archery, swimming and badminton.
king part in its games events encouraged the children and built their confidence.
It is also where they first met Ellie.
Hailey said: ""Ellie is patron of the DSA. We met her for the first time at a national games. 
""She comes along and helps with scoring, organising, with the children's warm-ups. Since then we have had a great friendship with her because she has the same dwarfism as us.
""She speaks to all the kids, and is a fantastic role model and a huge inspiration. Everything she has achieved, whether it's being a Paralympian, five gold medals or commentating on the Commonwealth games, everything she does, she is a really positive role model to all the members within the dwarfism community.""
Skye added: ""She is great, just hyper and helping out and she just brings a table with all her swimming things to give away to us, water bottles from Tokyo or a swimsuit.""
And she loved watching her on the Strictly stage.
""She was pretty good at it. She only learned for a little time and she was pretty awesome. I liked the sassy bits.""
For Hailey, it is more than that. It is helping people to understand what her life is like.
She told BBC Scotland's The Nine programme she was glad she was paired with average height professional Nikita Kuzmin.
Hailey added: ""My husband Scott is just under 6ft and within the community and the DSA we have all variations of relationships.
""Quite a few members with dwarfism with average height husbands and wives and we also have quite a few that are the same size.
""A lot of the kids with dwarfism - 80% of them - are from average height parents who can be so apprehensive and scared about what the future will hold for their child.
""It means everything when we are getting represented in real life.""
She cannot wait to see how the programme handles the partnership.
She said: ""My husband and I had a first dance at our wedding - people do look, people do take the mickey but I think Ellie showcasing it in this way with Nikita and the way they are going to have to adapt is going to be interesting.
""Because we have to adapt. We can't reach things, we can't do certain moves. It is going to be interesting to see how they fulfil that and just fill everyone who has dwarfism with confidence.""
She also believes the show's inclusivity will help young children.
""When you have dwarfism you can be on your own - the only one in the school, the only one in the town.
""But when you have somebody as big and vibrant on Strictly showing that maybe we have to adapt but we are still good, still able,  it really does help the community to see that and for others to appreciate it.""
Swimmer Ellie addressed the height difference ahead of her first show.
She said: ""Yes, I'm nervous about what it's going to be like. Nikita and I were chatting about it yesterday and we're going to just see.
""It might look different, and my partner's going to be tall and we're probably not going to be able to hold the same poses, but I'm sure it's going to work."""	/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-63055270
entertainment	Netflix's Jeffrey Dahmer drama attracts huge ratings and strong reactions	"Netflix's drama about serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer has attracted huge viewing figures but also criticism from people who say it's insensitive.
Rapper Boosie BadAzz tweeted: ""As black people we should boycott the [show]. What he did to our black kids is sick.""
Dahmer killed 17 boys and young men, many of whom were black and gay, between 1978 and 1991.
r of one of his victims has described Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story as ""harsh and careless"".
Rita Isbell, whose brother Errol Lindsey was 19 when he was killed, gave an emotional victim impact statement in court in 1992, but said she was not informed it would be recreated in Ryan Murphy's 10-part series.
She told Insider: ""When I saw some of the show, it bothered me, especially when I saw myself - when I saw my name come across the screen and this lady saying verbatim exactly what I said.""
She said Netflix should have given some of the money from the show to the victims' children and grandchildren.
""If the show benefited them in some way, it wouldn't feel so harsh and careless. It's sad that they're just making money off of this tragedy. That's just greed.""
Last week, Lindsey's cousin Eric Perry tweeted to say the family were unhappy about the series.
""It's retraumatising over and over again, and for what?"" he said. ""How many movies/shows/documentaries do we need?""
He added that ""recreating my cousin having an emotional breakdown in court in the face of the man who tortured and murdered her brother is WILD. WIIIIIILD"".
Dahmer's crimes also involved cannibalism and necrophilia. He was convicted in 1992 and was murdered in prison two years later.
Anne E Schwartz, the journalist who broke the story of his crimes in 1991, told the Independent the streaming series had ""sacrificed accuracy for the sake of drama"".
former crime journalist said the film-makers had taken ""artistic licence"" with many key details, saying the series ""does not bear a great deal of resemblance to the facts of the case"".
She also said the ""depiction of city police officers as racist and homophobic was incorrect"".
Netflix has also been criticised for initially categorising it as an LGBTQ show. That tag was later removed.
roversy has not stopped the show from notching up the streaming service's highest first-week viewing figures for a brand new series since its ratings system began in June 2021, according to IndieWire.
w, which stars Evan Peters as Dahmer, was watched for 196.2 million hours in its first full week, and is currently the number one TV show on Netflix in more than 60 countries.
Netflix has been asked for a response to the criticisms.
Its official synopsis says the series ""exposes these unconscionable crimes, centred around the underserved victims and their communities impacted by the systemic racism and institutional failures of the police that allowed one of America's most notorious serial killers to continue his murderous spree in plain sight for over a decade"".
Reviews for the show have been mixed, with the Guardian's Stuart Heritage calling it ""almost unwatchably queasy"".
He wrote: ""Worst of all, by some degree, is the show's choice of focus... The one good thing a show like this can do is steal the spotlight from the murderer and show who these people actually were. But Dahmer, for the most part, is unfortunately too infatuated with its star attraction for that.""
Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg called it an ""infuriating hodgepodge"", adding that ""reducing most of the victims and their families to their pain is closer to exploiting that pain than honouring any memories"".
But Forbes' Paul Tassi said: ""I don't know if 'liking' the series is the right word, as it's pretty unsettling to watch, but I do think it's well-acted by everyone involved, and the show does do a lot of work to maintain the focus is on the victims, the ineptitude of the police and the damage that Dahmer left in his wake."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63088009
entertainment	Cost of living: NI artists call for more funding to support sector	"""I can't make art... because I don't have the funding to back that up.""
Sinéad O'Neill-Nicholl is one of many local artists calling for more investment in the sector.
It comes as approximately three quarters of applications for the Arts Council for Northern Ireland's (ACNI) Support for Individual Artists Programme (Siap) fund were rejected.
ACNI said demand for the scheme has placed ""new pressures"" on funding available for individual artists.
fund aims to help artists purchase new equipment and develop new projects.
Sinéad O'Neill-Nicholl left work in the public sector to pursue a career in visual arts, but juggles family life with voluntary roles and multiple short-term jobs to get by.
""I really wanted to do something where I got up in the morning, and said: 'Oh my God, I actually love doing this.'
""But I do think I am very stretched at the moment,"" she told BBC News NI.
Ms O'Neill-Nicholl applied for Siap funding earlier this year to fund a mentoring scheme to progress her career to the next level. Funding would have allowed her to give up some of her paid work.
But her application was rejected in November.
She said she saw her application for funding as an investment in her future as an artist.
""It has really left me in a very difficult financial position even though I'm working,"" Ms O'Neill-Nicholl said. 
""I think my household shopping bill has doubled since this time last year, and what I'm paying out is ridiculous. I'm really having to think about things.
""I can't make art now. I want to, but I can't do that for the foreseeable future because I don't have the funding to back that up.""
About 920 eligible applications were received for the 2022/23 Siap General Arts Award fund, a combined request for £4.3m in funding.
However, the Arts Council funding pot was £985,000 - and 262 individual artists received money.
ree years ago, the total number of eligible applicants was 280.
""The subsequent 228.6% increase in applications to Siap's General Arts Award scheme this year, compared to those in 2019/20, has placed new pressures on the funding available for individual artists,"" a spokesperson for the Arts Council said.
A further £16.6m of funding would be needed to properly support and develop artists and organisations, it added.
PhD researcher and curator Jane Morrow was one of the applicants to get funding.
But she said the amount she and other successful applicants received would leave many making choices between living and working.
""Artists pay taxes, they pay gas bills and electricity bills in a cost-of-living crisis, they have food to put on their own tables and they can't afford to sustain it without a whole lot of other jobs,"" she said.
""I personally have 14 jobs... the system is just really broken and the problem is that it is hitting individuals.""
Ms Morrow worries a lack of understanding about how artists work will lead to many leaving the industry altogether.
""Northern Ireland has always had an issue with the brain drain in general, but it does mean that not only do artists leave here to go elsewhere to try and sustain their practice, but it also means that they just leave the arts entirely,"" she said.
""We're absolutely wrecked. The levels of burnout are insane because the perceived commitment to your vocation is supposed to sustain you.""
Emma Campbell, a member of the Array Collective who won the prestigious Turner Prize in 2021, said artists have been left feeling ""devalued"" by the lack of investment.
""This is cutting off the arts community at the roots.""
Ms Campbell said without proper funding, only certain individuals would be able to pursue art as a career.
""The worse that it gets, only wealthy people will be able to do it,"" she said.
""People won't stop being artists, but they will stop having the materials to produce art.""
Department for Communities (DfC), which provides some funding to ACNI, said it recognises the ""many challenges faced by arts and creative organisations and individuals in the sector in the current financial climate"".
""The department will continue to work, within the confines of its budget, to support the arts,"" a statement said.
According to DfC figures, £10.35m was given to ACNI for 2022/23, an increase of £150,000 from the previous year.
It added the level of funding is set ""within a context of pressures"" which are faced by all departments.
In September, the Republic of Ireland launched a basic income pilot for musicians, artists and performers.
For the next three years, about 2,000 creatives will be given a weekly payment of €325 (£278) to pursue their creative work.
DfC said no plans are in place to introduce a similar scheme in Northern Ireland.
""The department and ACNI will be carefully considering the outcome and evaluation of the Irish pilot to inform the development of any future programmes."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63594673

joined the star's former bandmates in Foo Fighters and Chevy Metal to play the songs he loved, as fans celebrated his memory.
Foos frontman Dave Grohl said the show honoured the fact that ""this many people connected through one person"".
Other star guests included Miley Cyrus, Rush, Cars and Mötley Crüe.
Alanis Morissette - for whom Hawkins played drums before he joined Foo Fighters - gave a fierce performance of You Oughta Know; while comedian Dave Chapelle unexpectedly covered Radiohead's Creep.
Pink made several appearances during the concert, joining Heart's Nancy Wilson to duet on Barracuda, before tackling Queen's Somebody To Love - a song that Hawkins often covered in concert himself - and teaming up with Foo Fighters to sing The Pretender at the show's finale.
British rock band Def Leppard recalled that they had first encountered Hawkins when he was a ""20-year-old kid"" working in a guitar shop in LA.
""About five years later we did Top Of The Pops in England [and] this kid walks into the dressing room. He was playing drums for Alanis Morissette,"" recalled singer Joe Elliot.
""That was Taylor Hawkins, so in memory of. Let's do some proper songs for Taylor."" 
Rock Of Ages before being joined briefly by pop star Miley Cyrus for an expansive version of Photograph.
""It's like a revolving door of rock heroes tonight,"" said Grohl halfway through the concert, which also saw performances from Skid Row's Sebastian Bach, Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler and Metallica's Lars Ulrich.
One of the most moving moments came when the surviving members of Nirvana, Grohl and Krist Novoselic, teamed up with fellow grunge musicians Matt Cameron and Kim Thayil of Soundgarden - who lost their lead singer Chris Cornell five years ago.
gether, they played haunting versions of The Day I Tried to Live and Black Hole Sun, with vocals from Taylor Momsen of the Pretty Reckless.
Rush, who are also mourning the loss of their drummer Neil Peart, played Working Man with assistance from Red Hot Chili Pepper Chad Smith and YYZ with Danny Carey of Tool.
And Wolfgang Van Halen delivered flawless renditions of his father's fretwork on covers of pop-metal classics Panama and Hot For Teacher.
rt came less than a month after a previous tribute show at Wembley Stadium in London, which saw Foo Fighters joined by Sir Paul McCartney, Liam Gallagher and Supergrass.
As at that concert, Hawkins' children played a key role, with his teenage son Shane stepping behind the drum kit for a blistering rendition of the Foo Fighters' hits My Hero and I'll Stick Around.
Hawkins' other children Everleigh and Annabel, also appeared on stage with their mother, Alison, after Queen's Brian May played Love Of My Life - a song that Alison had requested specially.
Earlier, the show had opened with Grohl's daughter Violet giving a low-key, moving performance of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah.
Six hours later, Foo Fighters closed the show with Everlong.
""This one's for Taylor,"" Grohl told the audience at LA's Kia Forum. ""We love you.""
Hawkins drummed with Foo Fighters from 1997 until his death in March of this year, aged 50.
No cause of death was announced, although a toxicology report showed traces of 10 substances in his body, including opioids, marijuana and anti-depressants.
Investigators did not say whether the mix of drugs was a factor.
Proceeds from both the London and Los Angeles tribute concerts will go to the charities Music Support and MusiCares.

entertainment	N-Dubz: The reunion tour full of surprises	"After an 11-year hiatus, fans couldn't wait for the N-Dubz reunion tour. But after such a long break it hasn't been without a few hiccups.
Gigs have been plagued with reports of fighting, late arrivals and the trio had to reschedule their Nottingham show after cancelling at the last minute.
But many fans say the shows have been amazing and the band is already planning another tour next year.
Some gave BBC Newsbeat their verdict on the long-anticipated reunion tour.
meback shows begin with a bold opening.
Before Dappy, Fazer and Tulisa emerge on stage for their set, an announcement is made to the audience.
ghts go down and a woman's voice speaks.
""This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the annual N-Dubz purge.
""Commencing at the siren... any and all antics including shouting nanani, vigorous vibing, intoxication, toxic behaviour and drunk-texting your ex will now be mandatory.""
""The vibe in the arena didn't feel right from the get-go,"" says Emilie Masson.
She lives in Nottingham and didn't think twice about booking tickets to see the group at the Motorpoint Arena on 22 November.
For the 25-year-old, N-Dubz is about the nostalgia - it takes her back to her school days where she remembers boys wearing Dappy hats and girls being ""The Female Boss"".
N-Dubz had a string of hits between 2006 and 2011 - including Ouch, Papa Can You Hear Me and Number 1 - a chart topping collaboration with Tinchy Stryder.
""It just brings back so many childhood memories of listening to it,"" Emilie says.  
""But I feel like it's kind of been tarnished now that the comeback tour has not really been a success.""
She says people were getting ""really riled up"" as rumours spread among the crowd that Dappy may not be well enough to perform.
After support act Wes Nelson finished his set, and after the headliners were due on stage, a last-minute announcement finally confirmed the performance had been cancelled.
""And that was it - it just kicked off. It proper kicked off,"" says Emilie.
""People were fighting and throwing drinks,"" she says. ""People were screaming and shouting and pushing you towards get down the stairs.
""It just became very unhinged.""
Emilie says the gig was so chaotic she had doubts about returning for the rescheduled performance.
Not all fans had a bad experience and a lot of the reaction online has been positive.
""There was so much on social media about fights, how people couldn't control the behaviour and stuff like that,"" says Fredi Moore. 
""I was a little bit worried but it was nothing like what I'd seen on TikTok and other social media.""
Images and videos shared online show violence breaking out at a number of shows, including in Birmingham and Bournemouth. 
But 29-year-old Fredi from London saw the band with her brother in the city on 17 November and had such a good time she bought tickets to see them again on Tuesday.
""It was absolutely incredible,"" Fredi says. ""I'm so happy that I've done it again.""
And despite what she expected, she says the London shows were actually ""really peaceful and respectful"".
She thinks N-Dubz have been unfairly criticised for the actions of a minority of fans. 
""I feel like the band has got a lot of negativity because it's their fans,"" she says. ""But the people that are going in, they're all adults.""
Both Fredi and Emilie also think a lot of the online discourse about fans, which has included class slurs, is also unfair.
""I've seen a lot of negative comments from people that didn't even go to the concert being really negative and nasty about the concert goers,"" says Emilie. 
""They were saying, 'what did you expect from the N-Dubz fans, this is what you get when you live in a council estate and you listen to that kind of music'.
""I think that's really unkind.""
After going their separate ways more than a decade ago, the N-Dubz comeback has clearly been a success for the group.
ut 17 shows, including some of the biggest arenas in the country. Such was the demand, they had to add a further six dates - all arenas.
And they're already preparing for more, recently announcing a new single and a further 11 tour dates next summer.

entertainment	Bangor's former courthouse reopens as music venue	"From courthouse to crooners - Bangor Courthouse reopens as music venue
A former bank and courthouse in County Down has reopened as one of Northern Ireland's newest music venues.
Court House, on Bangor's seafront, was once home to the city's magistrates' court.
Victorian-era building was decommissioned in 2013, leading to a campaign to transform it into an arts venue.
Local band The Florentines are set to be the first group to perform on its stage.
ue was built in 1866 as a branch of the then-Belfast Banking Company before becoming a magistrates' court in 1952.
mpaign to reopen the building as an arts venue was started by Bangor Shared Space before charity Open House took over.
Bangor's very own Gary Lightbody, lead singer from the band Snow Patrol, was among the project's supporters.
rity helped secure crowd and government funding to make the idea a reality.
xtensive renovation saw the removal of walls and internal remodelling while original features, like sash windows and cornicing have been restored.
ue now features a sound, lighting and audio/visual system alongside a kitchen and bar. 
Kieran Gilmore, director of Open House, said the renovation brought with it ""wonderful discoveries"", including the uncovering of an original tiled floor in the old banking hall.
""It has taken us seven long years and a great deal of trial and error to get to this stage,"" he said.
""We want to thank every single person who has played their part in making this project a reality and in bringing The Court House to Life.
Florentines will be joined at the venue's first performance by another local group, Lemonade Shoelace.
It will also host a regular classic film club, literary and spoken word events, comedy, theatre as well as pop-up food and drink events.
It will also lead to the equivalent of 15 full-time jobs once it is at full capacity. 
Justice Minister Naomi Long said: ""It is great to see the former courthouse being brought back into use through the Community Asset Transfer process.
""I am sure it will become an iconic arts venue that will make a significant contribution to the city of Bangor.""
Key funders of the renovation include The National Lottery Heritage Fund and the Department for Communities.
Dr Paul Mullan, director for Northern Ireland at The National Lottery Heritage Fund, said the conservation-led repairs have ""successfully preserved this important heritage, meaning the building is no longer at risk and creating a much-needed cultural venue to be enjoyed by locals and visitors from further afield"".

entertainment	Netflix adds disclaimer under The Crown's trailer for series five	"Netflix has added a disclaimer to its marketing for The Crown, saying the show is a ""fictional dramatisation"", ""inspired by real-life events"".
It appears under the YouTube trailer for the upcoming series five and on the streaming site's title synopsis page.
Netflix told BBC News the show ""has always been presented as a drama based on historical events"".
Dame Judi Dench and ex-Prime Minister Sir John Major have raised concerns about the accuracy of the royal drama.
ription of the series says: ""Inspired by real events, this fictional dramatisation tells the story of Queen Elizabeth II and the political and personal events that shaped her reign.""
Similar language has been used in press statements before, but no previous trailers or synopsis descriptions have carried the word ""fictional"". 
week, Dame Judi became the latest high-profile figure to call for The Crown to have a disclaimer at the start of each episode, to make clear the series is not necessarily true.
ress, who is close to King Charles and the Queen Consort, said Netflix ""seems willing to blur the lines between historical accuracy and crude sensationalism"".
She added there was a risk that ""a significant number of viewers"" would take its events as historical truth.
Oscar winner, who has portrayed Queen Victoria on screen, said suggestions expected to be made in the new series were ""cruelly unjust to the individuals and damaging to the institution they represent"", especially coming so soon after the death of the Queen.
Netflix has defended The Crown, saying series five is ""a fictional dramatisation, imagining what could have happened behind closed doors during a significant decade for the royal family - one that has already been scrutinised and well documented by journalists, biographers and historians.""
railer for the new series, which airs on 9 November, was released on Thursday. It suggests the series will focus heavily on Diana, Princess of Wales, and the fallout as she and Prince Charles, as he was then, prepare to divorce.
It includes a recreation of Princess Diana's 1995 interview with Martin Bashir. The real footage will not be shown on the BBC again after an inquiry found ""deceitful"" means were used to obtain it.
Diana, played by Elizabeth Debicki, is seen telling Bashir, portrayed by Prasanna Puwanarajah: ""I won't go quietly, I'll battle until the end."" In real life, Princess Diana did not say that in the interview.
Dame Judi's comments followed concerns by former prime minister Sir John Major, who said an upcoming scene that is said to include a conversation between him and Prince Charles, as he was then, about the Queen abdicating, was ""a barrel-load of malicious nonsense""."	/news/entertainment-arts-63341010

But he was amazed when several days later ""two really large boxes"" arrived containing a ""whole range of stuff for our age ranges"".
He said: ""It's a lot of stuff we would want if we were making a wishlist, certainly stuff the children enjoy.""
Mr Leigh told BBC Radio Cumbria it was a school priority that pupils be given books and they ""worry considerably"" about children's access to reading.
""It's vitally important,"" he said, adding: ""We know when parents share reading with kids they progress better in school. 
""[We want to say] a thousand thanks on behalf of the staff and children and parents and families for the gift of a book.

entertainment	Glastonbury 2023: 'Challenging times' blamed for ticket price rise	"Glastonbury Festival organiser Emily Eavis has said ""incredibly challenging times"" are behind a rise in price for next year's event.
Festival-goers will be charged £335 plus a £5 booking fee for standard tickets, with a £50 deposit.
In 2019, they cost £265 plus a booking fee for the 2020 festival that was ultimately postponed. In 2022, tickets went on sale for £280 plus a £5 fee.
Eavis said they had tried ""very hard"" to keep costs down.
""We're facing enormous rises in the costs of running this vast show, whilst still recovering from the huge financial impact of two years without a festival because of Covid,"" she said.
""The £50 deposit on ticket sales day in November will be the same as ever, with the balance not due until April.
""And, as always, there will be opportunities for many thousands of people to come as volunteers or as part of the crew.
""In these incredibly challenging times, we want to continue to bring you the best show in the world and provide our charities with funds which are more vital than ever.
""We are, as always, hugely appreciative of your ongoing support.""
world-famous music event will return to Worthy Farm in Somerset from 21 to 25 June 2023, and tickets - which usually sell out in minutes - will go on sale on 6 November.

entertainment	A warm place for playwrights during the cost of living crisis	"Playwrights have created warm spaces to support writers during the cost of living crisis.
A recent survey by the Playwrights' Studio found that playwrights often make less than the average income in Scotland.
Many have several jobs and regularly face financial insecurity, having also lost work during the Covid pandemic.
Coorie In scheme will run for six months in arts venues in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Birnam, Greenock and Stirling.
Centre for Contemporary Arts (CCA) in Glasgow will host writers weekly in the Playwrights' Studio headquarters.
Many said they turned up as they could not afford to heat their homes during the winter months.
Jayne Brown, 45, from Donegal, grew up in Easterhouse in Glasgow. She started writing freelance after taking night classes at the University of Glasgow.
She is writing her first play for her local theatre and also works part time at a museum.
Jayne told BBC Scotland she would otherwise struggle to heat her home during the winter months without access to the space.
""I've never written a play before, I've mostly done short stories and poetry,"" she said.
""So this is the ideal place to be, everyone is so lovely and supportive. I live in my own place and writing can be quite a solitary thing.
""The increase in heating bills is just an extra stress hanging over everyone just now.""
While the energy crisis loomed over the writers, they were also attracted to the mental health benefits of the new community.
Claire Macallister, 27, from Melbourne in Australia, said the project helped writers meet each other after the pandemic.
""Having a space that you know is going to be warm and filled with other creative people working in the same way, there's a real kind of comfort in that,"" she said.
""If I'm in a public space, I wouldn't feel comfortable staying more than a few hours. 
""But this takes off such a huge amount of pressure, and we can use it and the resources for free.""
Rebecca Dunn, 29, from Kent, has three jobs while also writing a play with Claire.
""You get to the point where it's so cold at home that you can't focus,"" she said.
""There's also something about going into a space to work and discuss your ideas.
""I'm in a flat share and it can be quite distracting, so it's good to have that mental separation.""
Many of the writers are putting together scripts to apply for funding. But despite weeks of work, the scripts might not even be selected.
So a second or third job is a necessity for most.
""You could put so much work into a script, but unless a company agrees to run it, you could make absolutely nothing off of it,"" said Kerry Lane, 28, from Dunedin in New Zealand.
""There's such a risk,"" Rebecca added. 
""Our last play was supposed to show in London but then the pandemic happened and it never ran.
""You don't really get solid commissions until much further on in your career.""
Guy Woods, 24, from London, works in a restaurant four days a week to pay the bills.
""I'm working on a play with my theatre company before we send it off for funding applications,"" he said.
""I mostly work at the restaurant later in the day and at the weekends, so I can work on the script during the daytime.
""It's unfair on my flatmate if I'm heating the house all day while she's off at work.""
Creative director at the Playwrights' Studio, Louise Stephens, said the idea was funded by Creative Scotland's cultural recovery fund.
""Playwrights expressed to us that they were worried about heating bills and keeping warm,"" she said.
""We're also coming out of the pandemic and people are missing interaction and human company, which is a perfect storm for freelance artists.
""Not only have they lost work and faced financial instability for two years, now there's a cost of living crisis.""
She added: ""A recent survey we conducted found that playwrights in general make less than the average income in Scotland and a lot of people make up their career doing different things. 
""It's really hard to have a sustainable career in the arts, so it's important we support people early in their career and throughout as they could be writing the next big Netflix show in a couple years.
""The arts are important to everyone's wellbeing and we want to help improve the living conditions of the people involved, even in a small way."""	/news/uk-scotland-63890010
entertainment	Celine Dion reveals incurable health condition and postpones tour dates	"Celine Dion has revealed she has been diagnosed with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), a rare neurological disorder with features of an autoimmune disease.
French Canadian singer told her 5.2m Instagram followers the condition makes her muscles spasm uncontrollably.
It has led to difficulties walking and singing, she said, meaning she will be unable to play planned shows in the UK and mainland Europe next year.
""I've been dealing with problems with my health for a long time,"" said Dion.
""And it's been really difficult for me to face these challenges and to talk about everything that I've been going through,"" the 54-year-old continued, in an emotionally-charged video.
""Recently I've been diagnosed with a very rare neurological disorder called Stiff Person Syndrome which affects something like one-in-a-million people.
""While we're still learning about this rare condition, we now know this is what's been causing all of the spasms I've been having.""
She added: ""Unfortunately, these spasms affect every aspect of my daily life, sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal chords to sing the way I'm used to.
""It hurts me to tell you today that this means I won't be ready to restart my tour in Europe in February.""
In 2014, the diva - whose ballad My Heart Will Go On, from the Titanic soundtrack, won the Oscar for best song - said she was putting her career on hold ""indefinitely"" as her husband René Angélil battled cancer.
Although her performances resumed a year later, she stepped away from the stage again in early 2016, following the tragic deaths of both Angélil and her brother, Daniel Dion.
She eventually returned with the 2019 studio album Courage, which featured collaborations with Sia, Sam Smith and David Guetta.
r supported the record with a world tour, large portions of which had to be postponed due to the Covid pandemic. She was forced to reschedule the dates again this year after developing ""severe and persistent muscle spasms"" which also delayed the return of her Las Vegas residency.
Several of those shows - including nights in Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester and London - have now been pushed back again, while others have been cancelled.
On Thursday, Dion reassured her fans that she had ""a great team of doctors working alongside me to help me get better"" while her ""precious children"" were ""supporting me and giving me help"".
She explained: ""I'm working hard with my sports medicine therapist every day to build back my strength and my ability to perform again, but I have to admit it's been a struggle.
""All I know is singing. It's what I've done all my life and it's what I love to do the most.
""I miss you so much. I miss seeing all of you [and] being on the stage, performing for you.
""I always give 100 per cent when I do my show, but my condition is not allowing me to give you that right now.""
No longer holding back the tears, the singer signed off by thanking fans for their support, stressing that she had no choice but to focus on her health and hoped she was on the ""road to recovery"".
SPS is a very rare condition and not well understood. 
According to the National Institute for Neurological Disorders, it is characterised by ""fluctuating muscle rigidity in the trunk and limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch, and emotional distress, which can set off muscle spasms.""
""Abnormal postures, often hunched over and stiffened, are characteristic of the disorder,"" they also note.
""People with SPS can be too disabled to walk or move, or they are afraid to leave the house because street noises, such as the sound of a horn, can trigger spasms and falls.
""Most individuals with SPS have frequent falls and because they lack the normal defensive reflexes; injuries can be severe.""
While there is no cure for SPS, there are treatments - including anti-anxiety medicines and muscle relaxants - that can slow down its progression."	/news/entertainment-arts-63904242
entertainment	Belfast arts scene 'damaged' by lack of studios, says report	"A shortage of studio and rehearsal space for artists and musicians risks causing ""severe damage"" to Belfast's cultural life.
rding to a ""cultural mapping"" report carried out for Belfast City Council.
It also said that Belfast was ""lacking in museums and art galleries"" compared with other similar cities.
Among longer-term ideas proposed to fund culture in Belfast, the report suggested introducing a hotel levy.
Other cities in the UK such as Liverpool, Edinburgh and Bath have also looked at introducing a ""tourist tax"" to pay for cultural events.
Councils in those cities have considered an additional small charge on hotel rooms of £1 or £2 to raise extra money to spend on culture but introducing such a move may need a change in legislation.
Artists recently held a protest in Belfast's Cathedral Quarter to appeal for more affordable workspaces.
Some who took part had lost their equipment and work in a fire in a building on Donegall Street at the start of October.
ultural mapping report was commissioned by Belfast City Council and the Department for Communities.
Carried out by the Daisy Chain Inc consultancy, it looked at how many museums, galleries, theatres, music venues and arts centres Belfast had.
But it also examined how much space and accommodation was available for artists, musicians and other people in the creative sector to work and rehearse.
""The lack of secure tenancy for artist studios in Belfast has put this sector in crisis,"" the report said.
It said there was an ""immediate need for provision for space for creative people to work"" and that was ""an existential threat that, if not addressed, will cause severe damage to the cultural fabric of the city"".
""With urgency, we recommend addressing the shortage of affordable studio space in Belfast,"" the report continued.
""This should not be limited to visual artists - we include musicians, writers, theatre-makers and all creative producers.
""Belfast studio groups have waiting lists and when art students graduate every year there is no space for them to work.""
report said that while the Cathedral Quarter area of the city was once ""home to vibrant art studios"", rising property prices had caused them to leave.
Other established studios, like Vault Artist Studios which houses over 100 artists and the city's first tool library in east Belfast, were coming to the end of their leases and looking for new premises.
Members of Array Studios, who won the prestigious Turner Prize in 2021, were among those who spoke to the report's authors.
report suggested a number of buildings in the city that could be used to provide more studio space, including the former Belfast School of Music on Donegall Pass in south Belfast and a former supermarket on Royal Avenue.
It also said that Belfast had fewer museums than comparable cities like Dublin, Edinburgh and Rotterdam.
""There is a gap in the infrastructure for both museums and galleries,"" it noted.
report said that the Golden Thread Gallery had a long-running plan to create a new venue and contemporary art gallery in the city centre, which could ""provide a visitor destination for the gallery and the region"".
""Golden Thread's years of planning and consideration for this project make them well placed to get this project over the line and increase the offering of contemporary art in Belfast,"" the report concluded.
Further, more detailed research on Belfast's venues, galleries, studios and museums and the number of people who use them is now due to be carried out.
report was presented to Belfast City Council's Growth and Regeneration Committee in November and is likely to be discussed when the full council meets on 1 December."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63748440

Hancock seems to struggle telling hosts Ant and Dec: ""I can't find any stars""  but is not heard saying the catchphrase ""I'm a celebrity, get me out of here!"" which would allow him to abandon the challenge. 
Walsh is heard shrieking as more insects land on him from above. 
r are taking part in their first trial without any public vote as an initiation challenge on entering the camp in Australia.
After being widely criticised for his participation in the show, Hancock said he would donate some of his fee to charity and that he hoped to use his time in the jungle to raise awareness for his campaign to support people with dyslexia.
In a letter being sent to some of his constituents, Hancock said: ""There are many ways to do the job of being an MP… Whether I'm in camp for one day or three weeks, there are very few places people will be able to see a politician as they really are and where politicians can speak candidly to the nation.""
He added that he ""fully understood"" constituents' concerns and how there were those who did not think he should be on the show. 
re was further criticism of Hancock during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. 
As MP Neil Coyle was being heckled from the Conservative benches, he suggested Tory MPs could ""go eat kangaroo testicles"" in a reference to Hancock's involvement in the show. 
Hancock, who resigned as health secretary last year after breaching Covid social distancing guidance by kissing a colleague, has entered the jungle after spending a period of time in isolation.
ries of I'm A Celebrity launched on Sunday, with Coronation Street's Sue Cleaver, singer Boy George and footballer Jill Scott among the contestants. 
A spokesman for Hancock said: ""Matt will be making a donation to St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk, and causes supporting dyslexia - including the British Dyslexia Association, off the back of his appearance. 
""He will, of course, declare the amount he receives from the show to Parliament to ensure complete transparency, as normal."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63576972
entertainment	Warhammer to be made into movie and TV show, starring Superman actor Henry Cavill	"Warhammer, the popular miniature table-top wargame, is to be made into a movie and TV show, starring Henry Cavill.
x-Superman actor will also executive produce the adaptation, which he called a ""lifelong dream come true"".
UK firm Games Workshop, which makes the game, said on Friday it has ""reached an agreement in principle"" for Amazon to develop its intellectual property.
roject will initially involve developing the Warhammer 40,000 universe, it confirmed.
ws comes just days after Cavill confirmed he will not be returning to play Superman in the DC Comics universe.
Cavill has previously spoken about his enthusiasm for Warhammer, a fantasy war game where players paint intricate miniature figures and have them battle each other.
In a statement on Friday, the British actor, 39, said: ""I have loved Warhammer since I was a boy, making this moment truly special for me. The opportunity to shepherd this cinematic universe from its inception is quite the honour and the responsibility.""
Another popular table-top gaming franchise Dungeons and Dragons has its own new movie coming next year, starring Chris Pine.
Warhammer deal is still to be officially confirmed and a further announcement will be made ""in due course"", the Nottingham-based games company noted.
Founded by friends in London in 1975, as a company selling board games and writing a fanzine for roleplaying adventures, Games Workshop has grown into the dominant player in the miniature wargaming world.
With shops in high streets and shopping malls across the globe Games Workshop is known, in the main, for producing Warhammer 40,000 and Age of Sigmar miniature games. 
, models and terrain need to be assembled and (often with great artistry) painted. They are used on a table-top where friends can then do battle in fantastical worlds, telling stories based on 40 years' worth of rules and backstory, created especially for the games. 
Despite its stores being closed during lockdown its sales soared - meaning the company's shares at one point, it's reported, were even outperforming those of Tesla.
However, Games Workshop has been more than just a miniatures company for years. It has its own book publishing division, and there have been many video game adaptations made - in-house anime, deals with Marvel Comics and toy manufacturers - all based upon the worlds created to host table-top battles. 
's news of a TV series deal is no surprise therefore, because Games Workshop has been carefully leveraging its intellectual property for a long time. Similarly to how comic book houses are no longer just the creators of comics, but have instead taken over Hollywood.
Previous attempts to get a high-end Warhammer adaptation over the line have failed, leaving endless discussion in fan forums and on social media as to who could play the setting's famous characters. 
re's a lot of speculation that Warhammer fan Henry Cavill, no longer in-line to continue as Superman on the silver screen, could be a key part of this adaptation. Perhaps there could be roles for other celebrity 40k fans Ed Sheeran and Vin Diesel? 
Fans will hope that this isn't another false dawn, and that the creators of this adaptation take good care of worlds that they know and love - despite the Games Workshop depiction of the 41st Millennium being exceedingly grim.
Financial analyst Andrew Wade, from Jefferies, told the AFP news agency this was ""very exciting news"" for Games Workshop, whose share price rose on Friday as a result.
""Licensing income has built strongly in recent years, from £2m in full-year 2015 to around £17m in full-year 2023, but we saw a more limited progression ahead, believing that only a major film deal would support another step-change,"" he said.
""With today's news, that is now a very real possibility.
""Moreover, a mainstream TV/film product could be game-changing in terms of Warhammer's brand reach and awareness.""
Elsewhere on Friday, it was also announced the acclaimed 2019 action video game Death Stranding will also be adapted for the silver screen, according to its Japanese creator Hideo Kojima.
In a statement, Kojima, who will co-produce the film, called the decision ""a pivotal moment for the franchise.

entertainment	Matt Hancock on I'm A Celebrity led to dozens of complaints to MPs' watchdog	"Parliament's watchdog received dozens of complaints about former Health Secretary Matt Hancock's appearance on reality TV show I'm A Celebrity. 
rliamentary commissioner for standards Kathryn Stone said the issue was not something she could investigate as it did not break any rules. 
But she said it raised ""important questions"" about what MPs did when they should be representing constituents. 
Her role investigates alleged breaches of the Commons Code of Conduct.
re has been widespread criticism of Mr Hancock for appearing on the show while he is a serving MP and he has been suspended from the Conservative parliamentary party. 
Ms Stone told MPs on the Standards Committee: ""It raises really important questions about members' proper activities while they're supposed to be fulfilling their parliamentary duties and representing their constituents.
""One member of the public contrasted the dignity of veterans on Remembrance Sunday with a former secretary of state... waiting for a buffet of animal genitalia and they wondered what had happened to the dignity of public office.""
She added that ""there is no job description for MPs but we have to think very carefully about the conflict between public and private interests, bringing the House into disrepute and so on"".
Ms Stone said she was also frustrated by the number of complaints she received about ministerial behaviour, which she is not responsible for investigating.
rime minister does not currently have an independent adviser on ministers' interests, who would normal provide advice on alleged breaches of the ministerial code. 
role has been vacant since Lord Geidt resigned as Mr Johnson's adviser in June and Ms Stone said a decision needed to be made soon on his replacement. 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged to appoint a new ethics adviser shortly. 
Ms Stone told MPs the largest number of complaints to her office - almost 1,500 - were over Partygate fines given to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak. 
Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak were both fined for breaking lockdown rules when they attended a birthday gathering in Downing Street in June 2020.
She said the issue was ""outside my remit"" but people felt they had ""nowhere else to go"". 
During her appearance in front of the committee, Ms Stone suggested that former cabinet minister Sir Gavin Williamson could be investigated over his past conduct. 
She was asked about claims that as chief whip, responsible for party discipline, Sir Gavin had instructed that when a cheque was given to an MP in financial difficulty to make sure ""he knows I now own him"". 
In response, she said: ""I have to consider very carefully any live case and I don't want to prejudice or undermine any investigation into a live case.""
Sir Gavin resigned from Mr Sunak's cabinet last week, after allegations of bullying emerged, and said he wanted to clear his name ""of any wrongdoing"".
Ms Stone, who is soon to leave her role, said she had been subject to death threats in the job and had separately received abuse from a ""minority"" of MPs over her investigation of Owen Paterson.  
Last year she found the then-Conservative MP had been responsible for ""serious breaches"" of lobbying rules. 
Mr Paterson subsequently resigned after a backlash at the government's decision to block his suspension from Parliament. 
Ms Stone said the abuse she received over the case did not affect her decision-making. "	/news/uk-politics-63641686
entertainment	Walker Art Gallery to host art prize winner Kathryn Maple's first show	"winner of a prestigious art prize is to stage her first major show in the gallery where she first found fame.
Kathryn Maple won the John Moores Painting Prize in 2021 with her work The Common, which now forms part of the Walker Art Gallery's permanent collection.
Her first major exhibition, Under A Hot Sun, will be staged at the Liverpool gallery in February 2023.
She said being able to exhibit in the gallery was a ""huge opportunity"".
Named after its sponsoring founder Sir John Moores in 1957 and hosted in the gallery, the annual arts prize is held with the aim of supporting artists and bringing to Liverpool ""the best contemporary painting from across the UK"", a representative said. 
Previous winners include David Hockney, Mary Martin, Peter Doig and Rose Wylie.
Maple, who is based in south London, would become only the second winner to present work in a solo exhibition at the site, following Jacqui Hallum's show in 2019.
rtist said her first solo show was a ""huge opportunity"" and would see her ""in the company of many artists who have inspired my practice"".
She said many of the paintings on display were ""inhabited by figures that synchronise with nature's deep rhythms"".
""I hope to provide a connection that is made through the surface of the paintings which resonates and echoes a sense of place,"" she said.
She said her technique saw her ""draw from life as much as possible"" before reimagining her drawings in her studio and ""assembling a new relationship to spaces I visit"".
""I am keen to keep the line searching and always expanding my vocabulary of mark making,"" she said. 
""This is important from the beginning to the end of a painting.""

entertainment	Pantomime returns to Aylesbury theatre 'with a vengeance'	"Pantomime returns unrestricted in 2022 after Covid rules brought the curtain down - and pushed productions online - for two years. In 2021, the pandemic was described as the ""elephant in the room"", with audiences kept at arms' length and often nervous to return to live theatre venues.
We asked some of those involved in the production of Aladdin at Aylesbury's Waterside Theatre what pantomime will be like this year.
Singer and comedian La Voix, who plays Widow Twankey, has been involved with the Waterside's pantomime since the theatre opened in 2010.  
In 2021, Cinderella went ahead with the cast in a ""panto bubble"", Covid testing every day and keeping reduced audience participation.
rtainer says looking back it was ""more stressful than we realised"".
""Last year we were one of the lucky theatres that opened and it was great for people to have the opportunity to escape the real world, it was joyous,"" she says.
""We managed to keep open, sometimes we were down to one villager and one dancer and people were doing other parts all over the place but we kept going.""
Cinderella also had no children involved in the show, either as dancers or singers.
""We didn't realise how key these things were to panto,"" she says, ""and there was also a lot of social distancing so there was a very different feel, but people were still up for a good time.""
r, the cast are ""100% full throttle back"", she says, and even the cost of living does not seem to have put people off.
""I think audiences have thrown caution to the wind and are saying 'we'll go to the panto now because we don't know if we'll still have the money later',"" La Voix says.
""Panto is a tradition that, until it was taken away, you didn't realise [how important it was] and now we're set to have the biggest selling panto in the theatre's history.
""We're back with a vengeance, it's great.""
Like La Voix, Andy Collins, who is playing Wishee Washee, has been involved with the Waterside pantomime from the beginning.
His 12 days of Christmas routine has become the stuff of legend in the area and usually involves him running around the theatre in a mass water fight with the audience.
In 2021, the routine met with the red tape associated with Covid. 
""Last year there was talk of not doing it,"" the BBC Three Counties Radio Breakfast Show presenter says, ""but I said 'if you can't do 12 days, you might as well not do the panto'.""
""So I had to basically sign my life away, and wear a mask and a big yellow suit to get out amongst them but it was great.
""I'm always blown away by 12 days of Christmas... the kids really get into it, it's absolutely bonkers... but this year it's even better, I love it.""
He adds that concerns that people might not come due to the cost of living crisis this year are not borne out in Aylesbury.
""I think [people] have realised it's about family time and having experiences and coming to the theatre is an experience as a family,"" he says.
""For the two hours you're in the pantomime, real life is left outside and you enter a world of escapism, fun and laughter and that's just what's needed at the moment.
""We have an unbelievable cast and a brilliant team, both back stage and out front - it's the perfect vehicle and at a time when life is tough, audiences are loving it.""
'It's the busiest panto in our history'
re director Sophie Denney says people have returned to the theatre with confidence, not just at Christmas but throughout the year.
Many venues asked for vaccination status or negative Covid tests well into the spring of 2021.
""Last year [panto] was about making the most of things and it was lovely to be back, but there was still so much uncertainty about everything,"" she says.
""We saw a real comeback once restrictions were not enforced any more across the board, people wanted to come back and move forward.
""Then just as concern about Covid was dwindling, the cost of living crisis came up.
""But if people have choices to make, then we're finding that going to the panto is still important.
""This year we are going to have the busiest one in our history.""
She adds that, through this year, people have been more ""selective"" and the last three years have proved the importance of ""listening to your audience"".
r demographic has also changed, with more visitors in the 18-26 age bracket. For some of the longer running shows, people are not booking as far in advance as they used to.
""Part of this is the Covid hangover,"" she says, ""and then with the cost of living people aren't sure what money they will have so they're waiting a bit longer to book, but there's not a drop in sales generally, it's just at different times. 
""It's our job to make sure that we're providing the content people want to see and make theatre accessible, like giving early bird discounts.
""We can offer escapism that is affordable, two crucial influencers in modern times.
""We're not saving lives but my goodness we are affecting them. Art stops people thinking about their difficulties and they find escapism.""

entertainment	The Berkshire film studio bringing Hollywood magic to the UK	"ke an exclusive 360° video tour of the state-of-the-art Shinfield Studios
With the UK film and TV industry seeing record levels of growth and investment, the buzz around the new state-of-the-art Shinfield Studios has been growing for months. Now the BBC has been given exclusive access, getting a glimpse inside the Hollywood-style complex.
Shinfield Studios is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2024 and one production has already completed filming at the site.
Once finished, the studios at Thames Valley Science Park, near Reading, will comprise 18 sound stages based in a more than one million sq ft (929,000 sq m) media hub.
Shortly after receiving full planning permission at the end of 2021, the studio confirmed a Disney production would start this year.
Standing inside one cavernous, 30,000 sq ft sound stage currently under construction, Nick Smith, joint managing director of Shinfield Studios, said: ""A whole variety of film and TV production will take place in here.
""Anything you can imagine that you see on screen can be made in a space this size. It's basically a huge acoustic box, it's got lots of power.""
ges provide a ""secure environment where people can come and create worlds that we will see on the television or in the cinema"", he explained. 
""Where we're standing now, any A-lister could be filming - but what it takes to make that production is not just the people in front of the camera, it's all those behind it.
""And the crew that we have in this part of the UK working on productions are really very talented. It takes a couple of hundred people working on the sets to create that illusion, that magic.""
V production slumped during the Covid pandemic lockdown but rebounded to a new high between October 2020 and September 2021, according to the British Film Institute (BFI).
Over that period a record £4.14bn was spent filming British and foreign shows like Bridgerton and Peaky Blinders in the UK.
Adrian Wootton OBE, chief executive of the British Film Commission (BFC), told the BBC: ""The UK film and TV industry is experiencing remarkable growth - perhaps the largest in my lifetime - with demand for feature film and HETV [High-end TV] production at record levels. 
""Studios across the UK have hosted some of the most successful and high-profile feature film and HETV productions in the world.""
Mr Wootton said the south east was home to the UK's largest crew base that was ""leading creative talent"".
Increasing stage space capacity at Shinfield, and across the UK, and providing the talent and skills to meet the demand, would ""help drive local and national economic growth and job-creation, enhancing the UK's reputation as a world-class destination for film and TV production"", he added.
Shinfield Studios, part of Blackhall Global Partners, expects to generate around £600m a year for the UK economy.
According to research by global property consultancy Knight Frank, production budgets are also rising as streaming services compete for subscribers, boosting the demand for large-scale, high-quality facilities.
With its 18 sound stages, workshops, offices and post production facilities, Shinfield Studios will be well placed to service big-budget blockbuster film and HETV productions.
And Mr Smith believes the Berkshire hub has an advantage over existing UK studios like world-famous Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. 
""What they haven't done is kept up with the pace of development and change that's happening in the industry,"" he said.
""What we're trying to do is to construct something that's absolutely perfect for 21st Century filmmaking and long-form television.""
Mr Smith said its location is perfect thanks to its proximity to London, the M4 motorway and nearby Reading.
""You can make the journey to Shinfield Studios from a West End hotel in 55 minutes, I've done it.
""And all the local bicycle networks in and around Reading and Shinfield mean you can cycle seamlessly from Lower Earley and Reading out to the studios and not encounter any other traffic. 
""All of these things were quite important when we were looking for a location.""
And he hopes a little dusting of Hollywood magic in the area could encourage more people to think about a career in the industry.
""It's not just actors and directors, we need a lot of people to help in all walks,"" he said.
A film production often needs carpenters, plasterers, electricians and even landscape gardeners, ""all the people whose names you see in the credits at the end of a film"", he explained.
""Whatever it is that you're interested in, you can work in the film industry,"" he said. ""Productions are getting bigger and bigger and the ones here at Shinfield will be some of the biggest coming to the UK.
""Whether it's Disney or Netflix, Apple, Amazon or Universal and Paramount, they can all come here. We're building something to a scale that will satisfy all of them.""
Dean Horne, head of Shinfield Studios operations, ran Shepperton Studios for 15 years, slowly working his way up from a studio runner, sweeping the stage.
""To be part of a project of this scale and this size, a brand new studio development from the ground up, is very exciting,"" he said.
re is no better job in the world, said Mr Horne, adding: ""There are so many opportunities.
""It's very exciting, when the studio is operational, no day is the same.""
Berkshire Film Office said it was already working with the studios ""getting local people into roles they might previously only have dreamed of"".
Lily Hudson, manager of the non-profit film production resource company, said the studios ""have already stimulated industry growth and further international investment"".
And as the new Elizabeth line nears full completion, ""businesses and freelancers are looking to move out of London down the railway track"", she added. 
""Berkshire is an attractive place for facilities and crew to relocate because it's quieter, with good transport links and amenities,"" she said. ""But it's also at the very heart of the growing screen sector.""

She said he returns every year to lecture year two undergraduates and ""we couldn't be more behind him"".

entertainment	Pavement on their reunion: 'We're like an uncaged tiger'	"Depending on who you ask, Pavement are either the greatest indie band of the nineties, or a minor blip on the rock landscape.
Formed in California in 1989, they were the ultimate underground band, whose noisy, shambolic songs were laced with enough melodic charm to lodge permanently in your brain. 
r first two albums, Slanted and Enchanted (1992) and Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain (1994) were hailed as masterpieces of lo-fi, slacker rock - a description that's technically true, but which fails to capture their magic.
From the fuzzy squall of Summer Babe to the celestial balladry of Spit On A Stranger and the goofiness of Cut Your Hair, Pavement knew their way around a pop song, no matter how awkward the delivery. 
uilt an audience who gorged on frontman Stephen Malkmus's wayward song structures and cryptic lyrics (""Lies and betrayals / Fruit-covered nails,"" he sang, mystifyingly, on Trigger Cut).
But after Crooked Rain pushed Pavement towards the limelight, an unpredictable follow-up - 1995's Wowee Zowee - put them back in the shadows. 
It was an act of commercial self-sabotage that only deepened their cult appeal. Pavement never committed the ""sin"" of having a hit song and they quit while they were ahead: Disbanding in 1999, with just five almost-perfect albums to their name.
r last show, in London's Brixton Academy, hinted at internal tensions. Attaching handcuffs to his microphone, Malkmus told the audience: ""These symbolise what it's like being in a band all these years."" When the gig ended, the band left on one side of the stage, and Malkmus walked off in the opposite direction. 
But percussionist Bob Nastanovich says the myth surrounding Pavement's demise is more dramatic than the reality.
""It's never been anywhere near as bad as people thought it was,"" he says. ""There really wasn't that much drama at all. It was more about exhaustion and desire to do other things.""
For Nastanovich, that meant a career in horse racing - but today he's speaking on Zoom from San Francisco, where Pavement are in the middle of a reunion tour (their second, after a previous fling in 2010). 
We're quickly joined on the call by Malkmus, mid-order at a local coffee joint. Americano in hand, he chats enthusiastically about their upcoming London shows and the band's giant video screen, which he's nicknamed R2-FU.
""The tour's been great so far,"" he beams. ""I'm sort of like a tiger let out of the cage. An older, greyer tiger.""
His sunny disposition might seem out of character to longtime fans. In Pavement's prime, Malkmus was often accused of being surly and aloof. According to drummer Steve West, there were times he refused to speak to his bandmates, pulling a jacket over his head and referring to himself as ""the little bitch"".
But he rejected those characterisations, telling one reporter it was all ""part of the act"". 
""I'm nice at the bottom of my heart, but I like the 'tough love, bitchy performer' thing.""
, he seems mellow. He talks in ellipses and apologises several times for rambling - but there's an obvious affection for Pavement and its fans.
fanbase has only expanded in recent years.
As the dust of the 90s settled, Pavement's stock rose, with acts like Blur, Animal Collective, Deerhunter and Beabadoobee citing them as a major influence. Rolling Stone recently ranked Slanted and Enchanted at number 199 in its top 500 albums of all time. Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain landed at 343 and Wowee Zowee (which has undergone a critical reappraisal) was at 265.
""It's a great compliment,"" says Nastanovich. ""But I mean, they had to put something from early 90s on there, other than Nevermind.""
Over the years, the band's archives have been raided for a series of album reissues that further enhanced their reputation, but Malkmus claims not to have heard them. Instead, he prepared for the Pavement reunion on YouTube.
""I listened to every song, just about, that we ever did, starting from the very beginning to make sure I had enough material to surprise people and make it magical and every show different.""
He has kept his word. 
ur is designed as a series of mini-residencies, and every night delivers ""a different set and a different vibe"", raved Rolling Stone critic Rob Sheffield. ""Twenty-five songs in two hours, rampaging all over their catalogue, rocking the house each night with a couple dozen of the greatest tunes ever written for electrically amplified string instruments.""
roblem? That big video screen ruins their spontaneity.
""We're used to passing out setlists 20 minutes before we go on stage,"" says Nastanovich, ""but to get everything set up for the show to work, it needs to be in five hours beforehand.""
Even so, the band have frequently thrown their plans out the window. 
""Last night we had a couple of band meetings on stage and changed a couple of songs,"" he confesses. ""I'm sure it's thoroughly entertaining for the audience to watch, you know? A cluster of people deciding what to play next.""
But the tour also sees a level of professionalism Pavement lacked first time round.
""We had a proper rehearsal this time,"" says Malkmus, only half-joking. ""In the 90s, tours were hammered down our throats at all times and we'd just jump on them. 
""This time, we worked on our chops, which is a funny thing to say with Pavement. The drummer in particular spent a year practicing. We never had a chance to do that before.
""But it's still loose, it's still Pavement,"" he reassures. ""The emotions coming at you are gonna take you back to when you first heard us.""
One track, however, is a new addition to the set.
Harness Your Hopes, a b-side recorded during sessions for 1997's Brighten The Corners, has suddenly risen from obscurity to become Pavement's most-streamed song,
Malkmus only became aware when he heard the song in a bakery near his home in Portland, Oregon. At first, he thought it was the Rolling Stones' Tumblin' Dice. Then the vocals kicked in and ""my kids said they knew the song"".
It turned out the 25-year-old track had inspired a TikTok dance craze.
""I assumed it was a kind of smaller viral hit,"" he says, ""but it turns out we're like a strong Omicron.""
He laughs when I mention the second verse: ""Show me a word that rhymes with pavement/And I won't kill your parents and roast them on a spit"" (the joke being that the second line describes the word ""depravement"")
""That's the kind of thing you write when you're feeling cocky and you think it's a b-side,"" says Malkmus. 
""It's sort of bizarre, how history rewrites itself.""
g has brought Pavement a new audience, although Malkmus grumbles that they never make it to the moshpit.
""I hate to say it, but there's, like, a halo of wealth at the front, where the tickets cost more. And it's fine, but it's almost always older people with disposable income.""
Ultimately, though, Pavement are happy on the nostalgia circuit. 
""I like going to reunion shows,"" says Malkmus, ""because, almost always, the dudes and women are psyched to be up there. 
""I mean, I hear stories about mega-bands like The Police who exist in separate rooms and are mailing it in for the cash. This is not that.
""The feeling in the band is pretty much the exact same as it was the first time we ever got into a minivan in the 90s.""
g he won't consider, however, is adding to Pavement's body of work.
""That'd be really weird,"" he says. ""These songs are solid. They're old but they're still alive. I don't know why you would do it.""
Pavement play four nights at London's Roundhouse from 22 October."	/news/entertainment-arts-63157311

entertainment	Glass Onion: Daniel Craig's Knives Out sequel continues Whodunit craze	"question of what has prompted the recent resurgence in Whodunits is practically a Whodunit in itself. 
Is the US TV series Only Murders In The Building behind their sudden popularity? The Thursday Murder Club novels by Richard Osman? Kenneth Branagh's re-imagining of Hercule Poirot? Or do the continued sales of Agatha Christie novels show that Whodunits never left in the first place? 
g we can truly be sure of is it was not Colonel Mustard in the drawing room.
Whatever the cause, they are certainly big business at the moment. Netflix reportedly paid $450m (£376m) for the rights to two Knives Out sequels, the first of which, Glass Onion, is released on Friday.
riginal Knives Out movie starred Daniel Craig as detective Benoit Blanc, alongside Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ana de Armas in her breakout role. 
An old-fashioned yet innovative murder mystery, it was not the kind of landfill superhero movie or sci-fi blockbuster that has stormed the box office in recent years. And yet, that is exactly what it did - taking $313m (£255m).
Glass Onion, which stars an entirely new cast apart from Craig, is the first of what could be many sequels. Its writer and director, Rian Johnson, isn't surprised by the enduring popularity of Whodunits. 
""It makes sense to me, because it's the same thing that's always been appealing about the genre,"" he tells BBC News. ""What's not to love? You have a rogue's gallery of interesting characters, you have a central charismatic detective, you have intrigue, you have mystery, comedy, human drama, all the ingredients are there.
""And for me, I'm a Whodunit junkie, I'm in heaven right now, the fact that there are more and more of these things, and that talents like Steve Martin are writing mysteries right now, to me, that's heaven.""
Steve Martin project Johnson is referring to is Only Murders In The Building, which also stars Selena Gomez and Martin Short. The successful comedy-drama was recently renewed for a third season.
It follows three neighbours who become suspicious that a murder has been committed in their building. The trio of unlikely sleuths team up to host a true crime podcast and solve the mystery.
Another big-screen Whodunit released this year was See How They Run, starring Sam Rockwell and Saoirse Ronan in a standout comedic performance.
It flew somewhat under the radar because it was released in cinemas the day after the Queen died, but it's now available on Disney+.
""I think murder mysteries seem to wax and wane in cinema,"" the film's director Tom George tells BBC News. ""But in the UK specifically, they're pretty constant. A year probably doesn't go by where there isn't some new imagining of an Agatha Christie story.""
Set in London's West End in 1953, See How They Run follows a director's efforts to transfer the success of Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap from the West End to the big screen.
But everything goes wrong when a key member of the production team is murdered. It is a riot - a murder mystery within a murder mystery - and one of the season's most enjoyable films.
""I think the reason Whodunits keep audiences coming back to them as stories is the audience are trying to do the same thing that the detectives are trying to do - crack the case,"" suggests George.
""And that makes for a brilliant story. In any film you're trying to get the audience to connect with their lead character or characters as soon as possible by sort of putting them in their shoes. 
""So in a Whodunit, that's kind of baked in from the start. So from very early on, the audience are locked in with the detectives. They're watching each of the suspects and trying to figure out, what are their tells? What can I learn from this interaction? And it just makes for a really compelling story. 
""And there's something really reassuring about a puzzle where you know that all the pieces are eventually going to click into place - something you don't necessarily get in everyday life or true crime.""
As well as being portrayed as a character in See How They Run, Christie was also an inspiration for Knives Out. Johnson says the queen of the Whodunit was a particular influence on him as a child. 
""It's a genre I just dearly love and have a real passion for,"" he says. ""I thought about growing up watching the Agatha Christie adaptations with my family, and how they were some of my most treasured movie experiences.
""And I thought, I think there are people who are really going to want to see something like Knives Out. So we rolled the dice, but we really didn't know [it would be that successful].""
While worldwide book sales are always a nightmare to verify, Christie's own estate claims she is the best-selling novelist of all time, and is outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare.
Last month, it was announced that Christie's The Mousetrap will finally open on Broadway, having played in London's West End for 70 years (Covid lockdowns excepted).
""The love of a Whodunit is embedded in British DNA, and I think we can trace much of this to Agatha Christie,"" says The Mousetrap's producer Adam Spiegel, who will also co-produce the show on Broadway.
""Her remarkable body of work both remains enormously popular with the public, and she is a source of great inspiration for the new generation of writers.""
wo of Christie's most famous murder mysteries have been remade in recent years with Kenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot - Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile.
A stage adaptation of another Christie mystery, The Mirror Crack'd, is touring the UK, while two new TV series about the author fronted by Alan Carr and Lucy Worsley recently aired on Channel 4 and BBC Two respectively.
Whodunits are everywhere you look. The BBC's excellent reality series The Traitors saw 22 members of the public gathered in a Scottish castle, tasked with finding three traitors in their midst. It regularly topped the iPlayer chart.
Glass Onion's producer Ram Bergman suggests Knives Out has had a positive influence on the number of Whodunits being commissioned.
""People were afraid to make those,"" he says, ""and I think because Knives Out was so successful, it kind of gave the freedom for the studios and streamers, 'there's an audience for these movies, let's make more of those'. Before, I think they were nervous about it.""
gin with, Glass Onion feels somewhat disappointing after the brilliance of Knives Out. But once the set-up has been established, the film changes gear.
""Once the twists kick in, Glass Onion is edge-of-the-seat stuff,"" said the Evening Standard's Charlotte O'Sullivan. ""The year's most ingeniously entertaining movie,"" is how Metro's Larushka Ivan-Zadeh described it.
But Kevin Maher of the Times said it is ""a bad case of sequelitis"", adding: ""It's bigger, louder, emptier. The plot, which is the driving force of any murder mystery, is conspicuously flimsy, with very few surprises and little ingenuity.""
So, how do you write a truly great Whodunit?
""First and foremost you come up with a story,"" says Johnson. ""Who is the character we care about, what is their dilemma, and how are we going to have a satisfying ending? Not just in the Whodunit sense of 'oh that person did it', but a truly satisfying story.
""And you come up with that and then you have your spine, and you start layering things on, figuring things out, and planting things here and there. The mystery part is the fun part, the tough part is coming up with a movie that's going to keep people entertained for two hours.""  "	/news/entertainment-arts-62645614
entertainment	Unseen: Show celebrates artists who have been homeless	"rtistic talents of people who have experienced homelessness are being showcased at an exhibition at The Brewhouse in Taunton. Named ""Unseen"" the exhibition shows ""there's so much more to them than their homelessness"", one of the organisers said.
Some find life easy as bread and butter.
While others end up living it in the gutter...
g we want you to take, that in this life it's ok to make a mistake. 
rt of a poem called That Life by Tom, who is a client of the Arc homeless charity in Taunton and one of the artists behind a new exhibition.  
""About 15 years ago I just started writing, picking up a pen and writing poems and short stories and stuff,"" Tom said.
He credits his father, an author, for passing on his ""creative gene"" to him.
""I've had a bit of a colourful past and it [poetry] is just another way of expressing that. 
""Showing that you can go through stuff and maybe come out of it the other side with a bit of positivity,"" he said.
m said he hoped displaying his pieces would warn others not to go down the same path, but if they did, it would let them know there was a way back. 
""I feel like I've pulled myself out of a bad place in life and I've come out the other side of it,"" he said.
""Hopefully in the future I'll be able to help other people do the same.""
Organised by Arc, the exhibition consists entirely of artwork created by those experiencing, or who have previously experienced, homelessness. 
Mark has a piece on display called ""My Mouse Ate My Pad"".
""I was given a pad to draw on and a mouse managed to eat part of it so I just drew around it,"" he said.
""I thought it was cute, it gave me inspiration.""
Mark, who has been homeless for a year and a half, explained that suffering with OCD meant every other aspect of his life ""has to be exact"" but art had allowed him a bit more freedom.
""When it comes to art I can make so much mess it's unbelievable, and it doesn't bother me in the slightest, and I can enjoy myself,"" he said.
As a child he said he was allowed to draw on his bedroom walls and normally does ""quite big art"", so it is unusual for him to do something quite small. 
Mark said he had been with Arc for the past two and half months and ""they have been phenomenal in helping"" him.
He added that he was currently feeling ""absolutely wonderful"". 
""Three months clear from alcohol, been offered a flat and really happy at the moment,"" he said.
Rosie Hather, from Arc, said: ""Quite often, sadly, people don't look past people's homelessness and they don't really see them as people. 
""There's so much more to them than their homelessness. They're very talented people in many different ways.
""Through offering tailored support for each of our clients, we get to know the person behind the homelessness, building on the unique traits and skills of the individual to inspire them to take positive steps forward.""
rity said it had provided art supplies to people they house and support for ""therapeutic reasons"".
""Through that we realised we had lots of really talented artists in our service, so we wanted to give them an opportunity to exhibit that artwork,"" added Ms Hather.

entertainment	K-pop: The rise of the virtual girl bands	"Since releasing their debut single I'm Real in 2021, K-pop girl group Eternity have racked up millions of views online.
g, dance and interact with their fans just like any other band.
In fact, there's mainly one big difference between them and any other pop group you might know - all 11 members are virtual characters.
Non-humans, hyper-real avatars made with artificial intelligence.
""The business we are making with Eternity is a new business. I think it's a new genre,"" says Park Jieun, the woman behind Eternity.
""The advantage of having virtual artists is that, while K-pop stars often struggle with physical limitations, or even mental distress because they are human beings, virtual artists can be free from these.""
ultural tidal wave of Korean pop has become a multibillion-dollar force over the last decade. With its catchy tunes, high-tech production and slinky dance routines, K-pop has smashed into the global mainstream, becoming one of South Korea's most lucrative and influential exports.
But the top K-pop stars, their legions of loyal fans, and the business-owners looking to capitalise on their success are all looking to the future.
With the explosion of artificial intelligence (AI), deepfake and avatar technologies, these pop idols are taking their fame into a whole new dimension.
rtual faces of Eternity's members were created by deep learning tech company Pulse9. Park Jieun is the organisation's CEO. 
Initially the company generated 101 fantasy faces, dividing them into four categories according to their charms: cute, sexy, innocent and intelligent.
Fans were asked to vote on their favourites. In-house designers then set to work animating the winning characters according to the preferences of the fans.
For live chats, videos and online fan meets, the avatar faces can be projected onto anonymous singers, actors and dancers, contracted in by Pulse9.
gy acts like a deepfake filter, bringing the characters to life.
""Virtual characters can be perfect, but they can also be more human than humans,"" Park Jieun tells BBC 100 Women. 
As deepfake technology moves into the mainstream, there have been concerns that it could be used to manipulate people's images without permission or generate dangerous misinformation.
Women have reported having their faces put into pornographic films, while deepfakes of Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymr Zelensky of Ukraine have been shared on social media sites.
""I'm always trying to make it clear that these are fictional characters,"" says the CEO.
She says Pulse9 uses the European Union's draft ethical AI guidelines when making their avatars. 
And Park Jieun sees other advantages in virtual bands where each avatar can be controlled by their creators.
""The scandal created by real human K-pop stars can be entertaining, but it's also a risk to the business,"" says the CEO.
She believes she can put these new technologies to good use and minimise risks for overstressed and pressurised K-pop artists trying to keep up with the demands of the industry.
Over the past years, K-pop made headlines for various social issues - from dating gossip to online trolling, fat-shaming and extreme dieting of band members.
genre has also spurred a conversation about mental health and cyberbullying in South Korea, after the tragic death of young K-pop stars, which many believe had a significant impact on their following. 
In 2019, singer and actress Sulli was found dead in her apartment, aged 25. She had taken a break from the entertainment industry, after reportedly ""suffering physically and mentally from malicious and untrue rumours spreading about her"".
Her close friend Goo Hara, another bright K-pop artist, was also found dead at her home in Seoul soon after. Before taking her own life, Goo was fighting for justice after secretly being filmed by a boyfriend, and was being viciously abused online for that.
For the human stars working around the clock to train, perform and interact with their fans, having some avatar assistance in the virtual world could provide some relief.
Han Yewon, 19, is the lead vocalist of newly launched girl group mimiirose, managed by YES IM Entertainment in South Korea.
She spent almost four years as a trainee, waiting for her opportunity to be thrust into the limelight - and one of many candidates who had to undertake monthly evaluations. Those who didn't show sufficient progress were let go. 
""I worried a lot about not being able to debut,"" says Yewon.
Becoming a K-pop star doesn't happen overnight. And with new groups making their debut every year, it can be hard to stand out. 
""I went to work around ten in the morning and did my vocal warm-ups for an hour. After that, I sang for two or three hours, I danced for three to four hours and worked out for another two hours"", says the vocalist.
""We practised for more than 12 hours in total. But if you aren't good enough, you end up staying longer."" 
Yet the prospect of virtual avatars flooding the industry worries Yewon, who says that fans appreciate her authenticity. 
""Because technology has improved so much lately, I'm afraid that virtual characters will take the place of human idols,"" she says.
Other K-pop groups, however, have been quick to adopt new avatar technologies - and the business is forecasted to grow steadily.
gital human and avatar market size is estimated to reach $527.58bn (£429bn) globally by 2030, according to projections by market consulting company Emergen Research.
At least four of K-pop's biggest entertainment companies are investing heavily in virtual elements for their stars, and five of the top-earning K-pop groups of 2022 are getting in on the trend.
Using virtual copies of themselves allow them to reach fans across time zones and language barriers - in ways that flesh-and-blood artists would never be able to do.
Girl band aespa, for instance, consists of four human singers and dancers (Karina, Winter, Giselle and Ningning) and their four virtual counterparts - known as ae-Karina, ae-Winter, ae-Giselle and ae-Ningning. The avatars can explore virtual worlds with the fans and be used across multiple platforms.
While chart-topping girl band, Blackpink made history with the help of their virtual twins, winning the first-ever MTV award for Best Metaverse Performance in 2022.
More than 15 million people from around the world tuned in to popular online gaming platform PUBGM to watch the group's avatars perform in real time.
During the Covid-19 pandemic Moon Sua and her K-pop group Billlie had to cancel their live performances and fan meets. Instead, the band's management company created virtual copies of band members, to throw a party for fans in the virtual world. 
""Since it was our first time doing it, we were a bit clumsy,"" says Sua.
""But as time went by, we got used to it, talking with the fans while adapting to the virtual world. We had such a good time.""
Moon Sua was impressed by how real the group's avatars looked, but says she still prefers to meet with their followers in person.
""I don't think it's something threatening. Maybe we can learn skills from watching them? I don't think they are a threat that can replace us,"" says the band's main rapper.
HE RISE OF THE VIRTUAL K-POP PRINCESS
With the rise of K-pop music globally, there has also been a growing phenomenon of hyper-realistic avatars in girl bands. BBC 100 Women takes a look at the impact of these flawless fantasy artists.
Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)
But there are also some concerns in the wider industry about ethical and copyright issues that avatar technologies can present. 
""There's a lot of unknowns when it comes to artists in the metaverse, virtual versions, icons of themselves, whatever it might be,"" Jeff Benjamin, Billboard's K-pop columnist, tells BBC 100 Women.
""It might be the fact that the artists themselves might not be in control of their image and that can create an exploitative situation."" 
For fans like Lee Jisoo, 19, who studies at engineering college, K-pop has been a welcome distraction during times of stress. She has been a dedicated Billlie fan since the group launched in 2019.  
""Their love for their fans is amazing. You cannot help but love them more,"" says Jisoo.
Jisoo collects fan albums and merchandise, while also interacting with the band online and in the virtual world. 
""I feel emotions through Billlie that I wouldn't have felt if I didn't like them,"" she says.
""And I'm fangirling even more because I want to give back those feelings to Billlie. I think this is a positive thing for me.""
But the virtual world can also be an unwelcoming space for K-pop stars and fans alike, with regulations to prevent cyberbullying or abuse lacking or rarely being enforced. The industry has been rocked by online bullying and smear campaigns waged against successful stars. 
""I get more stressed out when I see mean comments on Billlie online. Because it's also an insult to the things I like, so I get stressed out and heartbroken,"" says Jisoo.
Child and adolescent psychiatrist Jeong Yu Kim, who works in Seoul, says it's too soon to know how virtual technology and the rise of AI characters will affect young people. 
""I see the real problem is that we're not seeing each other in an authentic way,"" Jeong Yu says.
""In virtual worlds, we could be more free and do things that you can't do outside, you can be someone else,"" explained Jeong Yu. ""This K-pop industry is really responsive to what the public wants, and they would want their artists to fulfil that."" 
""Just like any entertainment industry, there are so many pressures,"" says Jeff Benjamin.
""The artists are really expected to always show a good image, they're supposed to be that shining example for their fans."" 
But this is changing, he says, and there has been an industry-wide shift taking place in order to better serve the mental health needs of the stars and reduce the intensive workload. 
""The artists themselves are also opening up about what's going on with their mental health, and that's actually forging a deeper connection with those fans."" 
In the fast-changing K-pop industry, it might be too soon to say whether virtual idols are a short-term fad or the future of the music industry.
But for now, for fans like Jisoo the choice of who to follow is an easy one.
""Honestly, if someone asks me, 'Do you want to watch Billlie on the metaverse for 100 minutes or in real life for ten minutes?', I'll choose to see Billlie for ten minutes in real life.""
She believes ""people who like real idols and people who like virtual idols are completely different"" - and for many like her, it would be ""hard"" to fall for the avatars at the expense of human K-pop stars.

entertainment	Northern Ireland shoots for success with TV and film productions	"fact that Blade Runner 2099, a TV series based on the films, will be shot in Northern Ireland, has been seen as a huge vote of confidence in Northern Ireland's screen industry.
But is only the latest in a long line of high-profile successes.
roduction follows in the footsteps of television hits like Game of Thrones and Line of Duty, as well as films such as The Northman - all of which which were shot in Northern Ireland.
And according to Northern Ireland Screen more are on their way.
""I would be very much hoping and expecting in the next couple of months that there'll be at least one further big announcement,"" NI Screen chief executive Richard Williams told BBC News NI.
ustry has become huge in Northern Ireland.
""Northern Ireland Screen supported projects that combined to over £1bn in terms of production budget in the last four years,"" said Mr Williams.
""Of that, something over £330m stuck on people, goods and services in Northern Ireland.""
So why has Northern Ireland become so attractive to production companies?
Andrew Wilson is a location manager who has worked on Line of Duty, The Fall and Belfast, among others.
""We're very small, that's a huge benefit that can't be underestimated because you're never two hours from anywhere here,"" he said.
""It's very attractive for us to be able to say 30 minutes from Belfast you can be on a beach, you can be half way up a mountain, you can be at any number of locations.
""Financially that's huge for a production, because if you travel for more than an hour you have to start to put the crew up overnight somewhere and it runs into huge money.""
Another draw is Belfast's Titanic and Harbour studios.
""We did a Netflix job at the Harbour studio, there's people I was working with, who have worked many, many years in many different studios and that was, for them, the best one they'd ever worked in,"" Mr Wilson said.
re are also financial incentives for production companies through UK tax credits and discretionary funding that Northern Ireland Screen uses to augment that.
""Why do people look to here? These days because we're a centre of excellence. We're a hub,"" NI Screen's Richard Williams added.
""It's very competitive and it never gets any easier because the projects come and go, but Northern Ireland's in a good place.""
rage TV production could have around 150 people working on it day to day, while a larger film production would have more than 200.
As a location manager, Andrew Wilson said that can present a number of challenges.
""I remember trying to get 200 people to the very top of Tollymore forest, onto the foot of the Mournes [mountains], horses and everything,"" he said.
""We had to build roads, sometimes you have to do that, you're creating carparks, building roads, depending on the budget of the production you're on.""
Mr Wilson said while recently working in Portaferry his department spent £30,000-40,000 in five or six days.
""That financial benefit goes directly to local businesses and to local people, a large chunk of it.""
Crews from outside Northern Ireland will, of course, need somewhere to stay and those providing accommodation have certainly benefited from the industry.
Aileen Martin of the Hastings Hotel Group said during the Covid pandemic the screen industry was vital.
""Whenever the doors were closed and the lights were out and we didn't know what was round the corner, filming was seen as essential,"" she said.
""So there was the film the Northman and another one, The School for Good and Evil, and they were an absolute lifeline, they kept the doors open for the Europa, the Grand Central and the Culloden [hotels], kept people employed when everyone else was lights out.""
In August, US novelist Adena Halpern wrote in glowing terms in the Hollywood Reporter about her time living in Northern Ireland's Holywood - in County Down - while her film director husband worked on Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.
Richard Williams said it is becoming common for those working in the industry to bring their families with them.
""Talent and high level executives are not immediately thinking they want to come and work out of Belfast,"" he said.
""But they find working for a period of time - sometimes quite a long period of time - in Northern Ireland can be very good in terms of work-life balance and that their family and loved ones can have a decent and enjoyable time while they're here.""
Andrew Wilson said he has worked with ""producers, directors from all over the world and they do have a good experience here, they enjoy Belfast, actors as well seem to enjoy it.
""There was a guy I worked with on [Netflix film] Lift for example, his wife had worked with him in Belfast previously and she loved it so much that she kind of talked him into doing the job so that she could come back and live here again for the guts of a year.""
While the 2008 film City of Ember may not be the most well-known, Mr Wilson said it was very significant for filming in Northern Ireland. 
""It was the first time Northern Ireland had ever hosted a major Hollywood production in its entirety,"" he said.
""Not long after, there was a movie called Your Highness that came in, which then in turn led to Game of Thrones.""
NI Screen's Richard Williams said success in the screen industry ""ultimately comes down to having hits"".

Frustrated by the lack of airtime for reggae music in the UK, Lepke setup a mast in his back garden and began to broadcast to a small area of West London every Sunday afternoon. DBC soon expanded to cover all styles of black music and with its unmistakable logo featuring a dread with headphones and a spliff became a trailblazer for the future of black British radio in the UK. 
Carmella Jervier aka Sister C told Witness History how hearing black female DJs like the Ranking Miss P on DBC inspired her to become a DJ.

entertainment	Clarkson's Meghan comments 'awful' but host will remain, says ITV boss	"Comments made by Jeremy Clarkson about the Duchess of Sussex in a column for the Sun have been described as ""awful"" by ITV's media and entertainment boss. 
Kevin Lygo said there were no plans ""at the moment"" to replace him as host of gameshow Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?
He said Mr Clarkson's comments did not represent ITV's values. 
More than 20,000 complaints have been made to the press regulator after Clarkson wrote on Friday that he ""hated [Meghan] on a cellular level"".
umn has now been removed from the Sun's website, at Clarkson's request, and replaced with a tweet in which he says he is ""horrified"" after ""causing so much hurt"". 
In his message to followers, posted on Monday, he described a reference he made to a scene in Game of Thrones as ""clumsy"".
Speaking at a Broadcasting Press Guild event in London on Tuesday, Mr Lygo said he had ""no control"" over what Mr Clarkson wrote in his newspaper columns. 
""We hire him as a consummate broadcaster of the most famous quiz on television, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" he said. 
""So it's not quite in our wheelhouse but I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote that. It was awful.""
Conservative MP Caroline Nokes has written to Sun editor Victoria Newton calling for action to be taken against Mr Clarkson, and for an ""unreserved apology"" to be issued to the duchess. 
r has been signed by more than 60 MPs. 
SNP MP John Nicolson, who sits on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, has written to chief executive of ITV Dame Carolyn McCall asking for Mr Clarkson to be removed as a host of the quiz show. 
Mr Nicolson said he had also written to Amazon, which broadcasts Clarkson's Farm and The Grand Tour, where the presenter appears alongside James May and Richard Hammond. 
In a call to Shelagh Fogarty's Monday show on LBC, the mother of late television presenter Caroline Flack condemned the comments. 
Responding to Mr Clarkson saying he would like to see the duchess humiliated, Christine Flack said it had ""upset her so much that Jeremy Clarkson was not only allowed to think that but to put it in print"". 
Caroline Flack's death in February 2020 was ruled a suicide by the coroner. 
An inquest in August 2020 heard ""her trauma was played out in the national press"" and that was ""incredibly distressing for her.""
Writing in his original column, Clarkson said: ""At night, I'm unable to sleep as I lie there, grinding my teeth and dreaming of the day when she [Meghan] is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her.
""Everyone who's my age thinks the same way,"" he added. ""But what makes me despair is that younger people, especially girls, think she's pretty cool. They think she was a prisoner of Buckingham Palace, forced to talk about nothing but embroidery and kittens.""
His column followed the release of the last three episodes of Netflix's docuseries Harry & Meghan on Thursday."	/news/uk-64046956
entertainment	Londonderry protest over proposed BBC Radio Foyle cuts	"Politicians, senior clergy and community leaders have called on the BBC to reverse its proposed cuts at Radio Foyle.
Protestors gathered outside the station in Londonderry on Wednesday afternoon.
Eight news staff are at risk of redundancy and output, including the Breakfast Show as well as local news bulletins, is being cut.
It is part of a wider plan announced on Tuesday to close 36 posts across BBC Northern Ireland to make savings.
rim director of BBC NI said the corporation faced ""some difficult choices, none of which are easy"".
""We have to find monies to maintain and develop our local presence on BBC iPlayer and to absorb cost pressures across different aspects of our work,"" Adam Smyth said.
""Our concern in all of this will be to safeguard audience value and benefit and to remain mindful of the impact that this announcement will have on BBC staff in Northern Ireland.""
Davey McCauley, who organised Wednesday's rally, said he has been listening to Radio Foyle for about 40 years and said it was so important to everyone in the city and beyond.
""This station is the heartbeat of this community,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle's News At One.
""Radio Foyle highlights and challenges issues that wouldn't be done anywhere else.
""If they take it away we don't think other broadcasters will cover them; if we lose it then we will lose an integral part of ourselves.""
Mr McCauley said the move by the BBC was ""a death by a thousand cuts"" and believes this was the first step in the potential closure of the station.
Marie Lindsay, former principal of St Mary's school in Derry, attended the protest because she felt she had to be there.
""I thought my protesting days were over, but you're never too old to protest for what is right,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle.
""It is right that BBC Radio Foyle is here and remains here in its full capacity.
""The turnout and the spectrum of people who have gathered here is quite unique.
""BBC Northern Ireland needs to understand the swell of feeling and swell of support for the staff and the work they do.""
However Alice Enders, who is an expert in the creative industries, told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that the BBC was in a ""squeeze in terms of its revenue"".
""The BBC has to keep pace with the development of the internet,"" she said.
""There is no doubt these cuts were made with a heavy heart because local radio is a popular with audiences,"" she said.
However she added that there has been a ""major migration to online services"" with audiences.
She said the BBC was facing alot of competition from streaming services.
""This is old media versus new media,"" she added.
""Everyone would like to have online services and at the same time maintain and keep all the local radio services - I'm very attached to local radio.
""But at the same time we are talking about a frozen licence fee and inflation,"" she said.
""None of these cuts are made with the stroke of a pen,"" she added.
Media commentator Stephen Price said the BBC was in the position where ""its licence fee has been frozen therefore it is having to find cuts somewhere.""
""News is the most expensive thing that the BBC does and it's probably not surprising that news is being cut,"" he added.
Under the proposals for BBC Radio Foyle, a daily 30-minute news programme will remain on BBC Radio Foyle along with the Mark Patterson Show and the Sean Coyle Show.
BBC Northern Ireland is planning to close 36 posts in an attempt to make £2.3m of savings and invest more money in online services.
According to the most recent BBC annual report, BBC NI has a workforce of about 600, with the majority of those employees based in Belfast at Broadcasting House and Blackstaff.
Staff and trade unions will now be consulted on the proposed savings plans.
Foyle MP and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood raised the concerns around cuts to BBC Radio Foyle at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he believed ""very strongly in local public broadcasting"" and would speak to the BBC about the cuts to BBC Radio Foyle.
Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, the Right Reverend Andrew Forster, said: ""What the BBC isn't getting, what we just heard from Adam Smyth that he doesn't understand is the uniqueness of Radio Foyle and the impact for our community.""
Bishop Donal McKeown said: ""Northern Ireland would be the poorer for not having that engine room generating news here."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63805019

entertainment	Who are voices behind Netflix's Harry and Meghan?	"release of Harry and Meghan's new Netflix documentary featured a kaleidoscopic cast of characters, some speaking about their relationship with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex publicly for the first time.
From family and friends to experts and witnesses, dozens appeared within the first three episodes.
r on-screen contributions added flavour to the highly anticipated ""tell-all"" docuseries, but left many wondering: Who are they? 
So here's some off-screen background information about a few of the cast. 
Ashleigh Hale, one of the more elusive media targets among the Harry and Meghan camp, spoke out publicly for the first time. 
Ms Hale, an attorney, is the daughter of Meghan's older half-sister, Samantha Markle. In the show, Ms Hale says she was raised by her paternal grandparents and that she later connected with Meghan over email. 
's when they ""hit it off"", Meghan told viewers. From there, the friendship grew. 
""There's like a sister element,"" Ms Hale said. ""There's something maternal, she's a best friend.""
However, Meghan's nuptials with the prince proved a source of friction with Ms Hale, who was not invited to the royal wedding. 
Ms Hale tells the interviewer she was ""hurt on some level"". The explanation given was that she was not invited because her mother, Samantha, wasn't. 
Meghan says inviting one without the other would have been difficult to explain to media. 
Doria Ragland is Meghan's mother. In the docuseries, she shares her first extensive public comments. 
Ragland told the interviewer: ""I am ready to have my voice heard.""
She describes the last five years of her life as ""challenging"" since Meghan's engagement to Prince Harry in 2017. 
Incessant paparazzi, whose interest in the royal couple is noted in the series, was troublesome for Ms Ragland, too. She says she felt ""stalked"" by them. 
Ms Ragland attributes to race a negative media frenzy over Meghan in the wake of her engagement.
She says she regrets not having conversations about race with her daughter earlier in life. 
Silver Tree is a Hollywood producer, director and writer who developed a relationship with Meghan during production of the US TV drama Suits, where Meghan was a lead actress. 
In a social media post last year, Ms Tree wrote that Meghan ""is one of my very nearest and dearest. Like all friends, I love her madly"". 
Ms Tree outlined in the post acts of kindness by Meghan - including giving her peonies on her birthday - and wrote: ""This is Meg before she met H (Prince Harry). This is Meg now. She's always been this person.""
In the programme, Ms Tree recalls her initial scepticism upon first hearing that Meghan was going on a date with the prince. ""We thought it was really funny. We were like, 'in what world does this happen?""'
However, she describes Meghan as ""crazy"" about the duke after meeting him.
Argentinian polo player, celebrity and model Nacho Figueras is known to be a longtime friend of Prince Harry. 
He first met the duke at a charity event for Sentebale in 2007 - an organisation co-founded by the prince - and is now an ambassador for it. 
Over the years, the two have also appeared on multiple polo pitches and recently played as teammates on the Los Padres team at the Santa Barbara Polo Club. Mr Figueras later described the moment in an interview with Vanity Fair as ""a dream come true"". 
In the docuseries, Mr Figueras commented on the early part of Harry and Meghan's relationship saying: ""You could tell right away that those were the eyes of someone that had fallen in love.""

entertainment	Former BBC Scotland journalist Derek Bateman dies aged 71	"Broadcaster Derek Bateman who reported and presented for BBC Scotland has died at the age of 71 after an illness.
He was born in Selkirk in the Scottish Borders and in 1968 became a teenage journalism trainee at The Scotsman.
Over the next 20 years he worked as a reporter there and at The Glasgow Herald.  
Mr Bateman went on to become the political editor of the newly-launched Scotland on Sunday newspaper before joining the BBC in the late 1980s.
His 1986 investigations into Robert Maxwell and that year's Edinburgh Commonwealth Games led to him co-writing a behind the scenes book about what had gone wrong.
During his 25 years at the BBC he became a distinguished and popular reporter, correspondent, and presenter.  
For more than a decade he was one half of a double-act with John Milne, presenting Good Morning Scotland.  
He also presented the weekend programme Newsweek Scotland; was a main anchor on Radio Scotland's election programmes, and towards the end of his time with the BBC worked as a reporter and presenter on political programmes and on Newsnight Scotland.
Mr Bateman retired from the BBC in 2013 but continued to blog and broadcast on Scottish politics.
Paying tribute, BBC Scotland's head of news, Gary Smith, said: ""BBC viewers and listeners across Scotland will be saddened to hear about the death of Derek Bateman.  
""His well-known voice kept our audiences informed - and Scotland's politicians on their toes - throughout his time on Good Morning Scotland, and on our television output too. 
""In addition to his illustrious broadcasting career, Derek was previously a highly regarded print journalist. 
""He will be missed by his former colleagues in the newsroom. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.""
Mr Bateman's long-term colleague, the former BBC Scotland correspondent Kenneth Macdonald, said: ""He knew he was good but not in a bad way.  It didn't come across as arrogance but as a calm confidence.
""And what an interviewer he was. I'm sure he did his homework but his political knowledge seemed as effortless as it was extensive. No politician ever got the better of him"".
Mr Bateman was married to the former BBC journalist Judith Mackay and they had two daughters, Hannah, and Clara.  
He also had two daughters, Eilidh and Lucy, from his first marriage to Alison, who died in 2001. "	/news/uk-scotland-64029023

Locals who gathered in the community hall to watch the Strictly final have expressed their delight at his victory.
Among those cheering on Hamza were siblings Sine, Caitlin and Innes Ferguson.

""It was unreal. It was like winning the World Cup, I think, for Ardnamurchan.""
Hamza had never had a dance lesson before taking part in the show, but villagers believe his talent was honed at ceilidhs. 
Innes, 21, who has known Hamza since he was in primary school, said his athletic ability was evident.
""I always knew he had the underpinning fitness because he's been lifting people around here, doing the famous lift,"" he told BBC Scotland. 
""[He's been] up the hills and he's been a rugby player as well throughout his youth so he's got the fitness.""
Innes added: ""We knew he was fit but didn't know he had the twinkle toes that he was showing.
""I hope he's going to perform a bit better at all the ceilidhs from now on.""
Caitlin, 28, is a graphic designer who also sells Gaelic-themed clothing. She has seen orders sky-rocket after Hamza wore her Ardnamurchan jumper on Strictly.
""It was mum's bright idea to post him one. I didn't know anything about it. 
""And then I saw him on the TV with it and I thought wow that's so cool.
""I was so surprised when orders just started coming in. I sold out twice and now I'm taking pre-orders so it's been quite crazy.""
Hamza has worked on The One Show as one of their wildlife cameraman, leading him to land his own CBeebies show and Let's Go For A Walk companion book.
He also appears on Countryfile and ITV's This Morning, and has filmed and presented Channel 4 shows Scotland: My Life in the Wild and Scotland: Escape to the Wilderness.

ructure in Brentwood, dubbed ""Unhenged"", was built by Joe McNamara as a warning about climate change.
Planning officers recommended the artwork should be deemed an inappropriate development.
But Brentwood Borough Council allowed the 53-year-old's construction to stay, giving it time to be entered for the Turner Prize art competition.
£250,000 structure is orientated so the midday sun on the winter solstice directly hits a central monolith, which features an image of Queen Elizabeth II.
It has an outer ring of 30 vertical blocks, measuring 36m (118ft) in diameter. The blocks are four metres (13ft) tall, and are bridged by 30 lintels.
re is a semi-circle within the outer circle, made of 10 shorter pillars and nine horizontal lintels.
repiece represents an hourglass and has SOS written in Morse code on the ground.
A series of LED lights on the artwork reflects a warming planet, Mr McNamara said.
""What it's about is climate change. It's Stonehenge on the outside and an hourglass in the middle,"" he said, as reported by the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
""The monolith sits on the neck of the hourglass. And that is basically telling us that time is running out in relation to climate change.""

A giant piece of artwork showing a hedgehog riding a bike has been crowned the winner of the Tour of Britain's land art competition.
""Spike on a bike"" was created in a Nottinghamshire village that was recently named Britain's most hedgehog-friendly street.
Children helped to create the image ahead of the cycle race passing through Keyworth in September.
ur director Mick Bennett said sharing their work ""fills me with joy"".
Dale Road was crowned winner of Britain's Biggest Hedgehog Street earlier this month by two wildlife charities.

Jennifer Manning-Ohren, founder of Wild Things Keyworth, which was behind the hedgehog highway, said: ""It was a wonderful, shared experience and I am so happy to have been a part of it.

One hedgehog was spotted using the fence hole three hours after it had been drilled
mage was captured on ITV4's live feed of the competition via a drone.
Artist Liz Waddell said: ""It was such a thrill when the drone went up and we saw what we had created - just from a hasty sketch on an A4 piece of paper, found materials and no experience of this kind of thing before.""
Mr Bennett said it had been a challenge to choose a winner from the many entries received.

entertainment	Why Emily St John Mandel asked for help getting divorced on Wikipedia	"It is rare for artists to want to talk about their love life in interviews. But Emily St John Mandel, the best-selling author of Station Eleven, The Glass Hotel and this year's The Sea of Tranquility, is insisting on it.
Over the weekend, Ms Mandel put a call-out on social media asking for helping getting her marital status updated on her Wikipedia page.
, user-edited encyclopaedia said she was married, but in fact, she is not: her divorce from her husband was finalised in November.
But when the Canadian author tried to amend the page, she found herself in a bit of a ""Kafkaesque"" situation.
""It turns out, you're not actually the expert on your own life as far as Wikipedia is concerned. You do need a secondary source,"" she told the BBC.
""I just hit this brick wall, you know, when I spoke to the editor over there, and, and got that information.""
Interviews usually happen in accordance with a publication schedule - with the paperback edition of The Sea of Tranquility not due until April, it could be months before she corrected the record. 
So this weekend she turned to social media, to see if any journalists would want to ask her about her marital status in an interview. The BBC was all too happy to offer assistance, as did Slate. Now, all is right with her Wikipedia page.
Ms Mandel finds herself in good company - in 2012, author Philip Roth wrote an open-letter to Wikipedia that was published in the New Yorker, so that he could correct an inaccuracy about the real-life inspiration for one of his novels. 
unds like the kind of surreal mundanity that could have happened to a character in one of her novels, which are often about the daily rhythms of cataclysmic events, be they pandemics, time travel, Ponzi schemes, or even fame itself. 
In her latest book, The Sea of Tranquility, the character of Olive Llewellyn, a stand-in for Ms Mandel, is an author whose book about a pandemic is published just before an actual pandemic takes hold. A similar thing happened to Ms Mandel, whose 2014 novel Station Eleven, about the near-end of humanity after a pandemic, became a bestseller again during the height of Covid-19 and was adapted into a critically acclaimed series on HBO Max.
She said she chose to write about her experiences because it was ""such a strange existential moment"".
""I don't feel like I predicted anything. Pandemics are just something that happens, as horrible as they are. But at the same time, it was kind of an interesting and surreal experience to have spent so much time talking about and travelling in the service of a book about pandemics and then all of a sudden, it's the real thing and having to compare fact and fiction.""
She also mined some of her odd real-life encounters on tour for Station Eleven for the character of Olive. 
""Ninety-nine per cent of the time, it's great, but if you do hundreds of events that 1% does add-up. I had a collection of sort of surrealist tour moments that I kind of wanted to write about.""
Perhaps her recent encounters with online bureaucracy could be fodder for her next book. "	/news/world-us-canada-64033028

entertainment	The Crown: Cast defend criticism of Netflix show at London premiere	"Stars of The Crown have defended the show after critics accused it of ""crude sensationalism"".
Speaking to BBC News at the show's premiere, Dominic West said: ""I think a lot of people are very sensitive about the show since the Queen died.""
r, who plays Prince Charles in the drama, added: ""A lot of people are worried about what will be in it, but I don't think they need to be.""
w series focuses on a turbulent decade for the royals in the 1990s.
High-profile figures, including Dame Judi Dench, had called for a disclaimer to be added to remind viewers scenes are imagined. 
In a letter to the Times, the veteran actress said Netflix ""seems willing to blur the lines between historical accuracy and crude sensationalism"".
Former prime minister Sir John Major also described a scene, showing Prince Charles having a conversation with him about the Queen abdicating, as ""malicious nonsense"".
Netflix later added the words ""fictional dramatisation"" to the trailer for the new series.
""I think it's been misrepresented in the press and it's a big fuss about nothing,"" claimed Jonny Lee Miller, who plays Sir John in the programme.
Airing two months after Queen Elizabeth II's death, there is likely to be even more interest in this series than in previous years.
Filming for series six was paused while the country observed a period of mourning in September.
rogramme's third actress to play the late Queen, Imelda Staunton, told the BBC the drama should be viewed as ""still history"" as it's set 30 years ago.
She said she felt ""hugely honoured"" following in the footsteps of Claire Foy and Olivia Colman, as well as playing the late monarch.
Speaking at an earlier press conference Jonathan Pryce, who plays Prince Philip, said: ""People will gain a bit of comfort seeing her embodied again.""
He told the BBC's David Sillito that the series ""sets out to to humanise the Royal Family and allow us to experience some of the emotion they had.""
fifth series focusses on the marriage breakdown of the then Prince and Princess of Wales.
ress playing Diana, Elizabeth Debicki, said the script is ""extremely empathetic to both camps"" and claims ""it's fair to both sides"".
Princess Diana's death, in a 1997 car crash, doesn't feature in the new 10 episodes but it will in the final series.
Dominic West, who has met the King working with charity The Prince's Trust, said he ""wouldn't have done it"" if he didn't think the writing was fair.
racter is ""such a great part"", West said. ""That's really what actors live for and you can't really turn it down because he's an amazing character.""
ued relationship between the now King and Queen Consort will be shown on screen, at a time when public support for the monarchy was dropping.
Royal author Katie Nicholl told the BBC: ""This is the start of King Charles III's reign. I was told by a former member of staff that he always feared that his reign would be overshadowed by the spectre of Diana. 
""The spectre of the past, and those fears, when you consider this series of the crown, are completely justified because there will be a whole demographic tuning into Netflix, particularly the younger generation who are not as familiar with the accuracy of this storyline."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63559862
entertainment	Taylor Swift: Judge dismisses Shake It Off copyright lawsuit	"A US lawsuit alleging that Taylor Swift stole lyrics for her hit song Shake It Off has been dismissed by a judge.
Songwriters Sean Hall and Nate Butler had claimed the pop star lifted lyrics in her song's chorus from their own hit Playas Gon' Play. Swift denied being aware of the song prior to the lawsuit.
However, court filings show a judge dismissed the copyright lawsuit ""in its entirety"" on Monday.
ue to go to trial on 17 January.
Swift said she had drawn from her own experiences and ""commonly used phrases and comments"" she had heard throughout her life for the track and that the lyrics had been written ""entirely by me"".
US trade publication Variety reported the two parties had ""reached an agreement"" and jointly asked for the case to be dismissed.
rms of the settlement were not clear; however, the song's writing credits remain the same at the time of writing.
Playas Gon' Play, the song written by Hall and Butler, was released in 2000 and performed by US girl group 3LW.
Both that song and Shake It Off feature variations of the phrases ""players gonna play"" and ""haters gonna hate"".
judge, Michael Fitzgerald, had previously rejected the case, saying the lyrics were too ""banal"" to be copyrighted.
In his original ruling, the judge cited 13 earlier songs that featured similar phrases, including Playa Hater by The Notorious B.I.G. and Dreams by Fleetwood Mac.
Hall and Butler appealed against the ruling and a federal appeals court reversed his decision, which sent the case back to Judge Fitzgerald.
However, a court filing obtained by the PA news agency showed Judge Fitzgerald had dismissed the lawsuit earlier this week.
""Pursuant to the parties' Stipulation, this action is hereby dismissed, in its entirety and with prejudice, Plaintiffs and Defendants to bear their respective attorney's fees and costs,"" the filing read.
Swift, 33, previously said she had ""never heard"" of the 3LW song prior to the lawsuit.
""The lyrics to Shake It Off were written entirely by me,"" she said, in a sworn declaration also obtained by PA.
""Shake It Off is about independence and 'shaking off; negative personal criticism through music and dance.
""In writing the lyrics, I drew partly on experiences in my life and, in particular, unrelenting public scrutiny of my personal life, 'clickbait' reporting, public manipulation, and other forms of negative personal criticism which I learned I just needed to shake off and focus on my music.
""Prior to writing Shake It Off I had heard the phrases 'players gonna play' and 'haters gonna hate' uttered countless times to express the idea that one can or should shrug off negativity."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63956480
entertainment	Diana Panorama interview: BBC settles with Earl Spencer aide	"BBC has reached a settlement with Earl Spencer's former head of security, after his bank statements were forged by Martin Bashir to help secure an interview with Princess Diana.
Alan Waller had claimed false documents were used to win the late princess's trust in an effort to encourage her to be interviewed on Panorama.
A 2021 inquiry led by Lord Dyson found Bashir acted in a ""deceitful"" way to secure an interview with Princess Diana. The corporation said it had now settled with Mr Waller.
""Following the publication of the Dyson Report last year, the BBC and Alan Waller, a former employee of the brother of Diana, Princess of Wales, today announce that a settlement has been reached between them,"" the corporation said in a statement published last Thursday.
""The BBC has agreed to pay Mr Waller an agreed sum in damages and to pay his reasonable costs, and apologises to him for the false information included in the fabricated bank statements used to procure the 1995 Interview with Diana, Princess of Wales. 
""The BBC hopes that Mr Waller is now able to draw a line under this chapter, and we wish him the best for the future.""
Mr Waller was left ""deeply distressed"" by Bashir's tactics, according to documents filed at the High Court. Mr Waller said his business ventures suffered when his name was linked to the scandal.
Bashir's interview with Princess Diana was broadcast by Panorama in late 1995, when she was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced.
More than 20 million people watched the programme. In it, the princess famously said ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to the then Prince of Wales's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles, whom he later married.
Following the publication of Lord Dyson's report last year, which strongly criticised the corporation, the BBC made an ""unconditional apology"" over the way the interview had been obtained.
BBC said the report identified ""clear failings"" and that while it now has better procedures in place, ""those that existed at the time should have prevented the interview being secured in this way""."	/news/entertainment-arts-63131425

entertainment	Avatar: The Way of Water world premiere takes place in London	"Avatar: The Way of Water, the sequel to the highest-grossing movie of all time, has held its world premiere in London.
Its much-delayed launch comes 13 years after the original sci-fi film, which was released in 2009.
Director James Cameron was joined on the blue carpet in Leicester Square by stars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver and Kate Winslet.
Avatar series is set on the lush planet of Pandora where the existence of the Na'vi people is under threat.
Speaking at the premiere, Weaver said the film has the ""family"" as the central theme over the environment as it is more ""universal and relatable"".
""It was a joy to be part of that family, we were at each other's throats sometimes, Jim [Cameron] wanted that... for us to kind of get at each other, still have fun and it's very much a real family,"" she said.
Here are some pictures from Tuesday's world premiere in London, and you can find more information about the film further down. 
Here are the answers to some burning questions earthlings may have about Avatar: The Way of Water.
first film followed a paralysed marine Jake Sully (played by Worthington) as he travelled to the planet of Pandora, where he took on an avatar body.
He ended up joining the planet's indigenous population in fighting an attempt by humans to destroy their home to obtain a precious mineral.
Way of Water is set many years later. Jake now has a family with Neytiri (Saldaña), and it follows their new life on Pandora.
In 2010, a year after the original Avatar, 20th Century Fox (as the company was then called, before it was sold to Disney) said there would be two sequels, and that the first of those would be released in December 2014.
rget proved to be somewhat ambitious. And for the next few years, a regular story out of Hollywood was that the release date had yet again slipped back. 
December 2014 became December 2016. Which became December 2017. Which became December 2018. You get the idea. Anyway, it's finally out next week, Friday 16 December 2022.
Cameron threw out one version of an Avatar sequel that, after writing it, he decided didn't deliver.
Canadian filmmaker also has a life outside cinema, and has spent some time doing deep ocean exploration (although maybe that counts as research for the new film, much of which takes place in and under water).
Cameron also wanted to plot out four sequels. And to take full advantage of new filming developments in the worlds of motion capture and CGI.
Well, it's not Cameron's longest film. That honour goes to Titanic, which clocks in at a hefty 3hrs 15mins.
But Avatar: The Way of Water isn't too far behind. Avatar 2, as it may otherwise be called, has a running time of approximately 3hrs and 12mins.
Slightly less if you dive out at the start of the lengthy end credits!
rs of the original epic, Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldaña have returned.
So does Sigourney Weaver who - (spoiler alert) - died in the original film. 
re joined by young newcomers Jack Champion, James Flatters, and Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, alongside Oscar winner Kate Winslet.
Speaking about the sequel's storyline on Tuesday, Saldana said: ""It felt like a natural progression for someone like Jake and Neytiri.
""That's the natural course that they decided to follow, is to start a family and and to keep that family together, to protect that family.""
Earlier in the evening, Cameron confirmed on The One Show he found inspiration from his dreams. ""I just think the dreams are my own private streaming service that runs every night for free,"" he joked.
""I guess I do a lot of work in my dreams and I see a lot of imagery, sometimes [I] get up and write it down sometimes. With some of the stuff for Avatar when I was in college, I jumped up and did paintings... so this has been going on for a while.""
He added: ""I've always had dreams of being underwater with amazing animals swimming around and that sort of thing, so it's just kind of working all that subconscious imagery out.""
It's made a total of $2.92bn (£2.39bn) at the global box office, and is the biggest film of all time (unadjusted for inflation).
It briefly lost its title to Avengers: Endgame in 2019, but regained it after Avatar was re-released. 
film is being released in a variety of formats. Including 3D, 2D and Imax. So no one's forcing you to see it in 3D if you don't want to.
But perceived wisdom is that a big part of the original's appeal was its stunningly immersive 3D sequences.
Currently a total of four sequels are planned, including this one. 
Avatar 2 is out next week, of course, while Avatar 3 has already been shot, and is due for release in 2024.
Avatar 4 has been partly shot ahead of a planned 2026 release. And Avatar 5 has a finished script. If it's made, and there is a question mark over that, it'll be out in 2028.
uncertainty is because of the films' cost. The Way of Water had a budget of more than $350m (£287m) which means it needs to be hugely successful at the box office to recoup its money. 
If it's a relative failure, it's hard to see Disney putting up hundreds of millions more to finish a series that they think the viewing public may have lost interest in.
In 2018, BBC News revealed that the planned titles were The Way of Water, The Seed Bearer, The Tulkun Rider and The Quest for Eywa.
Way of Water was finally confirmed in April of this year. Only James Cameron knows whether he will stick with the other titles. 
riginal was nominated for nine Oscars including best picture, losing out to The Hurt Locker.
Its wins included best production design and best visual effects. Many expect that a similar showing is possible at the 2023 Academy Awards."	/news/entertainment-arts-63875730
entertainment	Strictly Come Dancing: Hamza Yassin 'always stood out'	"Strictly Come Dancing contestant Hamza Yassin was hard to overlook long before he hit the dancefloor, his former university tutor has said. 
wildlife presenter, a former student at Bangor University, won three 10-point scores for his performance with partner Jowita Przystal on Saturday.
Conservation science professor Julia Jones recalls him turning up for a field trip in a tutu and tights.
""He did stand out,"" she said.
Hamza, who studied zoology with conservation in Bangor, now works as a CBeebies presenter but still comes back every year to give lectures to conservation practice students in their second year.
""He's been so generous with his time,"" Prof Jones told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.
""All of us staff and students are behind him.""
As a student, he once called her bluff when she told him jokily to wear a pink tutu and shiny tights rather than sensible waterproofs and wellies on a field trip to the Menai Strait to count water birds.
""Overnight he sourced a pink tutu and shiny tights,"" Prof Jones said.
""He comes pirouetting down the road in his rugby top - he was a keen rugby player - and a pink tutu.""
Hamza was given an honorary Masters degree at Bangor University this summer and gave an address to the graduating students.
""The real theme of the lectures he gives is the hard work needed to make luck happen,"" Prof Jones said, adding that while he was ""living his dream"", it took real perseverance. 
Hamza is severely dyslexic and said Bangor University offered him a lot of support. 
""He's just a really nice chap, what you see is what you get. He's just utterly likable,"" she added.
She did not expect him to be as light on his feet as he has proved to be, adding that she thought he could ""go all the way"" in the competition."	/news/uk-wales-63283714

In July, it was decided 2022 winners Ukraine could not host and the event was moved to the UK, with Liverpool later chosen as host city.
Ryder's Space Man earned him second place in the contest and the UK charts.
Speaking at the MTV Europe Music Awards, he said he would ""enjoy it no matter what country it is in"".
Following Kalush Orchestra's win in May, show organisers the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) opened talks with the BBC after assessing the situation in Ukraine following Russia's invasion.
It was subsequently decided the contest would move to the UK and was awarded to Liverpool after a bidding process.
Speaking on the red carpet before the MTV awards in Dusseldorf, Germany, Ryder said he had been a fan of Eurovision since he was a little kid and ""it never mattered where it was"".
""If I lived in Liverpool, it might be a different story,"" he said.
""I would be like, 'Oh my God, it is coming here'. The traffic is going to be mental.""
He said he would ""enjoy it no matter what country it is in"", but added: ""As for my role, I can't begin to presume.""
""I just want to be there. I would love to see it and experience it at home with everyone else.""
He added Liverpool was ""such an amazing city"", which had ""given us the bedrock of music as we know it"", but he was also looking forward to the contest reflecting ""the richness of Ukrainian culture"".
After the contest was awarded to the Merseyside city, Culture Liverpool director Claire McColgan said it would reflect ""what Ukraine and its people deserve"".
""We're just hosting it, it's their party,"" she added. 
Speaking at the MTV event, Kalush Orchestra singer Oleh Psiuk said his band were ""very grateful to the UK for helping to deal with this situation"".
""And of course we hope the UK can integrate some details of our culture, something that is important for Ukraine, because we did our best last year,"" he said.

entertainment	Mariah Carey: US singer's application to trademark 'Queen of Christmas' denied	"Mariah Carey's application to trademark the moniker ""Queen of Christmas"" has been denied by the US Patent and Trademark Office.
American star's application was rejected after her company did not respond to another singer's opposition.
rademark would have given her the legal right to stop others from using the title on music and merchandise.
Carey also failed in attempts to trademark the abbreviation ""QOC "" and ""Princess Christmas"".
r has become synonymous with the festive period since the release of her 1994 track, All I Want for Christmas Is You.
Completing a journey 26 years in the making, the ubiquitous festive classic finally reached number one in the UK singles chart in 2020.
Carey's company Lotion LLC applied for the yuletide trademark last year, leading to another singer, Elizabeth Chan, putting in a legal challenge in August, in an attempt to block her from obtaining the registration.
Chan - dubbed ""Queen of Christmas"" by The New Yorker in 2018, for having put out original festive records every year for a decade - criticised Carey for attempting to monetise Christmas.
""I feel very strongly that no one person should hold onto anything around Christmas or monopolise it in the way that Mariah seeks to in perpetuity,"" said Chan in an interview with Variety in August.
""That's just not the right thing to do. Christmas is for everyone. It's meant to be shared; it's not meant to be owned.""
Chan went on to say Carey had been ""trying to trademark this in every imaginable way"" from music, clothing and alcohol, to ""masks, dog collars - it's all over the map"".
""If you knit a 'Queen of Christmas' sweater, you should be able to sell it on Etsy to somebody else so they can buy it for their grandma,"" she went on. ""It's crazy - it would have that breadth of registration.""
Carey's company did not respond to Chan's opposition in time so the trademark was not granted, meaning knitters around the world can continue without fear of breaching Christmas copyright.
BBC has asked Carey's team for a comment.
Another singer, Darlene Love, previously took to Facebook to say she had been ""Queen of Christmas"" since before Carey rose to fame.
Love is known for her Christmas classic Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) and covers of hits such as Winter Wonderland and White Christmas.
Earlier this month, it transpired that Carey was no longer being sued for copyright infringement over her own Christmas hit, after country singer Andy Stone dropped his legal action.
gwriter - who performs under the name Vince Vance with the band Vince Vance and the Valiants - sued the popstar in June, claiming he co-wrote a song with the same name five years earlier. 
He told a court he would dismiss the case - but legally he could still refile it.
Christmas came early for Carey last week, when Netflix treated her to a special early screening of series five of The Crown at her home as a reward for being the show's ""ultimate superfan""."	/news/entertainment-arts-63647164
entertainment	Will Smith: Have Emancipation reviews been influenced by the slap?	"Will Smith's first film since he slapped comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars has received a broadly warm response from critics.
But many reviews of Emancipation also focused on the wider narrative surrounding Smith - and whether the film could provide a path to his redemption in Hollywood.
Set in the 1860s, Emancipation follows a slave, known as Peter, who escapes from a plantation and flees through the swamps of Louisiana, chased closely by his former masters.
-and-mouse premise sees a wounded Peter seek clothing, food, water and hiding places for several miles as he attempts to evade the slave hunters.
He is seen encountering dangerous animals and attempting to cover the scent of his blood so it can't be picked up by sniffer dogs.
film, which was shot before this year's Oscars took place, has attracted several four-star reviews - although a few critics graded it as low as two stars. Some focused solely on the film's content, but others debated the circumstances surrounding the release.
Industry figures are waiting with interest to see how the public will react to the film, after Smith was disgraced for smacking Rock on stage during March's Academy Awards.
""That scandal may temper audiences' enthusiasm for seeing what would regardless be a brutal portrait of slavery, but positive reviews might at least encourage fans to seek out this sturdy drama,"" noted Screen Daily's Tim Grierson.
was referenced in the headline of a four-star review of Emancipation written by The Telegraph's Robbie Collin, who said: ""This tough, tense chase thriller could prove Will Smith's redemption.
""Will Smith's new film was shot in the summer of 2021, long before The Slap was so much as a tingle in his palm,"" Collin noted.
""But if he had specifically sought out a project that would get the world to move on from the fracas at March's Academy Awards, he could have hardly found a more convincing one. Emancipation is a finely crafted, unflinching pursuit thriller.""
Emancipation is loosely based on the real-life story of Gordon, a former slave also known as ""Whipped Peter"", who was the subject of a famous photograph which showed the impact of slavery.
ure shows severe scarring of Gordon's back from whippings, and became one of the most well-known photos of the abolitionist movement during the American Civil War.
Some critics, such as Deadline's Valerie Complex, did not mention the slap at all while delivering their opinion of the film.
Instead, Complex examined the ""ongoing debate on about whether films like this are 'trauma porn', or unnecessary in an age where the black people yearn for modern stories of other types of heroics"".
""Honestly, the thought of walking out crossed my mind several times,"" she wrote of Emancipation. ""Not because the film wasn't up to par, but seeing so much black death onscreen is exhausting and painful, and there is only so much I can take - even if the ending of a film is hopeful.""
But other critics did reference the moment in March when Smith hit Rock after the comedian made a joke about Smith's wife Jada. 
Oscars ""ironically did even more to yoke the movie into Hollywood's annual horse race at its own expense,"" according to IndieWire's David Ehrlich.
He drew parallels with other outdoor survival films, writing: ""Here is a $130 million prestige picture that better reflects the consequences of The Revenant than it does those of Reconstruction.""
Smith is within reaching distance of a best actor nomination at the Oscars, however he has stiff competition in the category. 
While he is banned from attending the ceremony from 10 years, he is not blocked from being nominated.
""The viability of Smith's star persona has of course been cast into doubt since this particular project was set in motion,"" said Justin Chang of the LA Times.
""Which is why the much-analysed events of Oscar night 2022 have generated so much anxiety around their likely impact on the movie's release, box office potential and (God forbid) Oscar prospects.""
Earlier this week, Smith told US chat show host Trevor Noah: ""I understand how shocking that was for people. I was gone. That was a rage that had been bottled for a really long time.""
In a separate interview with CinemaBlend about Emancipation, Smith said: ""The people on this team have done some of the best work of their entire careers, and my deepest hope is that my actions don't penalise my team.""
Guardian's Peter Bradshaw referenced the slap only in passing in his four-star review.
""Whatever his current travails, Will Smith brings a movie-star presence to this brutally violent civil war drama, with a physical stillness and defiantly steady gaze,"" he wrote.
Bradshaw described the film as a ""strong, fierce, heartfelt movie"", adding that it ""works very efficiently as a thriller, with Peter on the run from his pursuers"".
Emancipation is directed by Antoine Fuqua, who is well known for helming Training Day, The Equalizer and Olympus Has Fallen.
It co-stars Charmaine Bingwa as Peter's wife Dodienne, and Ben Foster as a brutal slave hunter who chases Peter through the swamps with his dogs.
Independent's Clarisse Loughrey awarded the film two stars, dedicating her whole opening paragraph to the slap and the events that followed it. 
However, she wrote: ""For my own part, I believe there are trickier and more productive conversations to be had about Emancipation.""
""The film is primarily a film concerned with individual heroism to a near-mythic extent (see: the alligator wrestling). How can that ever sit right with a historical trauma still viciously pumping through America's bloodstream?""
She concluded: ""The film never feels as if it's truthfully telling the story behind the photograph. Or how one man's pain became emblematic of an entire nation's evil.""
movie is ""essentially a two-hour adaptation of a photograph,"" wrote Empire's John Nugent, landing in the middle with a three-star review which did not reference the slap.
""The film is, undeniably, singular and sometimes overly simplistic in its approach,"" he said. In both his face and physicality, Smith convinces as a man who could survive extreme hardship and sustain a sense of self."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63795259

26-year-old previously won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Emmy for their performance as Princess Diana in series four of The Crown - but that was at a time when Corrin was still accepting she/her pronouns.
re starring in two high profile films this year - My Policeman and Lady Chatterley's Lover.
""It's difficult for me at the moment trying to justify in my head being non-binary and being nominated in female categories,"" Corrin said. 
Reflecting on the fact that they largely play female roles, Corrin wondered: ""When it comes to categories, do we need to make it specific as to whether you're being nominated for a female role or a male role? 
""You can discuss awards and the representation there, but really the conversation needs to be about having more representation in the material itself, in the content that we are seeing for non-binary people, for queer people, for trans people, because then I think that will change a lot. 
""When those parts come up, meaning more people and more actors are playing those roles then I think there will be more of an urgency with which these questions will be addressed.""
A Bafta spokesperson said the organisation was ""engaged in proactive and thoughtful consultation on this subject"". The organisation behind the Oscars, the Academy, is also believed to be conducting research and holding discussions on the issue.
Debate about gender-free categories is gathering steam, with the music industry leading the way. The Grammys went gender-neutral in 2012, while the Brit Awards merged their male and female solo categories into an artist of the year category this year. 
Chart-topper Adele went home with the first trophy. However, in her acceptance speech, she said: ""I understand why the name of this award has changed, but I really love being a woman and being a female artist. I do. I'm really proud of us.""
Analysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter
more complicated debate than it looks. While gender-neutral categories are seen by some as socially progressive, they could have unintended consequences and there are several factors to consider. 
Firstly, this decision could actually result in less equality in the long term. The Oscars currently guarantee two male and two female acting winners every year, but a merger could mean it skews one way or the other over time.
ke the most recent winners as an example. It is unlikely Jessica Chastain would have beaten Will Smith if they had been competing in one overarching category. 
rtly because this year's best actress race was wide open, whereas Smith was considered a dead-cert in his category. 
But it's also because the best picture category tends to have more overlap with best actor than best actress. Chastain's film wasn't even nominated for the top prize, unlike Smith's. As a result, women could have a higher hill to climb to score a win.
In the long-term, it's not hard to imagine the outrage if a decision like this led to a repeated loss of recognition for worthy winners, particularly women.
's not the only obstacle. The Academy is made up of thousands of members, many of whom have been around for decades and are keen to protect the traditions of the Oscars. Getting some of them on side could be difficult.
feelings of other actors should also be taken into account. If gender-neutral categories were implemented at the Oscars, that would halve the number of acting awards from four to two, permanently reducing an actor's chances of winning an Oscar during their lifetime by 50%. 
While many Hollywood stars consider themselves progressive, they also have rather large egos and will not be enthusiastic about the prospect of forgoing trophies (and the career boost that comes with them).
It's worth noting the existing model does not discriminate against trans actors - Elliot Page and Laverne Cox could both be nominated in the current gendered categories - however it does leave non-binary stars without a home.
But how should this be addressed? Creating a new, separate category for them wouldn't be realistic as there would not be enough nominees. Another proposed solution where actors submit for the gender of the character they are playing would only be a short-term fix, until non-binary characters become more common in films. 
So far, only a few film awards have eliminated gender-specific acting categories, but in August, the Independent Spirit Awards, which honour filmmakers outside the major studios, became one of the most high-profile awards groups to ditch separate best actor and best actress categories and combine them into one prize, with 10 nominations. 
move followed similar steps by the British Independent Film Awards,the Gotham Awards, and the Berlin Film Festival.
Corrin's comments come as they prepare to take to the stage in an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's novel Orlando, which was published in 1928 and explores gender identity.
Orlando begins life as a young man in the 16th Century, who travels through time and gender to become a woman in the 20th Century, having affairs and heartbreaks along the way.  
""On a very personal level, I really relate to the journey of gender and the celebration of fluidity,"" Corrin said.
me something of a pin-up for non-binary identity, sharing their gender journey on social media. Last year they also posted pictures of themselves wearing a chest binder.
Corrin said they decided to share their story publicly because ""it was a journey that was at the very centre of who I am, who I was when I started talking about it"".
""Your gender identity is so much to do with how you feel and it ties into so much of how you want to be seen or are seen by people and that can be very triggering or can make you uncomfortable if you don't feel you are being seen honestly or correctly.
""I think that it was necessary for me to be open and honest about it because otherwise I would have felt I was being perceived wrongly.""
""visibility and representation"" is key to the ""necessary and urgent"" discussions around gender in society at the moment.  
""I know how much I've been helped by people in the public [eye] who have been open and generous with their journeys and how much it's helped me feel comforted and acknowledged and like I am on the right path. 
""And I think that if I could help in any way by being open, then that would be good.""  
worry that being so up front would limit the kind of roles they got offered in the future. 
""I would never sacrifice integrity or honesty because of work that I may or may not get. My being non-binary is not a rejection of femininity or my femininity in any way. It's sort of an embrace of that. 
""I still want to play women, my experience on this earth has been a female one - and now it's sort of a very fluid one.""

entertainment	Lost Hancock's Half Hour episode found by Lowestoft teacher	"A teacher has said discovering a lost episode of Hancock's Half Hour is ""the biggest find, probably the jackpot"".
Marriage Bureau is from the first series of the iconic 1950s radio show and is the only one to feature actor and comedian Peter Sellers.
Richard Harrison, 49, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, who buys old reel-to-reel audio tapes, was amazed to realise he had found the long-lost episode. 
It has been restored and will be broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 18 October. 
Mr Harrison said: ""I listened hard and thought, 'This seems very fresh, I don't think I've heard it before'.
""And in the end credits they announced Peter Sellers and that was that moment - hang on a minute, I've found this episode that's been on a wish list, a dream list really for me, for 20 years.""
Hancock Appreciation Society tweeted its members were ""absolutely delighted by the news"".
Hancock was a household name in the 1950s, most famously through Hancock's Half Hour which was broadcast on BBC radio and television. 
-starred actors and comedians Sidney James, Hattie Jacques, Kenneth Williams and Bill Kerr.
In fact, Peter Sellers, co-star of another 1950s BBC radio programme The Goon Show, only appeared in the Marriage Bureau as a replacement for Kenneth Williams. 
Mr Harrison, a Lowestoft Sixth Form College teacher and film maker, said: ""Looking back, the only episode Peter Sellers appeared in - and it's a really good episode as well -  why on earth didn't they think well we'd better keep that one?
""The Goon Show was very popular at the time and you'd think, 'Well it's an obvious one to keep'.
""But tapes were reused because they were felt to be ephemeral, with no repeat value - and sometimes they couldn't be repeated without it costing [more] for contractual reasons.""
Mr Harrison will appear in BBC Radio 4's Raiders of the Lost Archive on 13 October.

entertainment	Aitch on his rise to fame: 'I've still got goals to achieve'	"""You don't even want to see the mess in here, to be honest.""
Manchester rapper Aitch is on Zoom from his tour bus in Leeds, diligently angling the camera away from the floor, the night after a launch party for his debut album, Close To Home.
22-year-old has grown used to life on the road, ever since he broke out with his tongue-twisting freestyle Straight Rhymez in 2018. 
rack, intended as a throwaway placeholder for his YouTube channel, racked up millions of streams and brought him to the attention of Stormzy, AJ Tracey and Ed Sheeran - who all invited the baby-faced rapper to guest on their tracks.
In the last three years, he's scored seven UK top 10 singles, from the cocksure boasts of Taste (Make It Shake) to this year's Ashanti-sampling Baby.
With a best new artist nomination at the Brit Awards, and a brief but high-profile relationship with Amelia Dimoldenberg, he's installed himself as one of UK rap's most colourful and recognisable stars. So why did it take him four years to release his debut?
""Not for any particular reason,"" he shrugs. ""It was all going so well without an album that I just didn't feel like I had to rush it.""
Later in our conversation, though, he suggests he simply wasn't ready.
""I feel like my music in the past - especially, like, early days - it's never really had any meaning to it. 
""Back then it would just be, 'Let's let's just say loads of rhyming words and make it sound good.' Whereas I tried to make a difference with this. In the studio, I'd be trying to think of something that genuinely  means something and sends a message.""
uendoes and goofy wordplay haven't vanished completely, but tracks like Belgrave Road and Sunshine deliver more honest reflections on life, fortune and fame; while My G is a heartfelt letter to his younger sister, Gracie, who has Down's Syndrome.
""That's just a little personal one,"" says Aitch, shyly. ""I don't care whether that gets one stream or one billion streams. I just wanted her to hear it and know where I stand.""
Aitch was born Harrison Armstrong in New Moston, in north Manchester. His father was a pipe fitter, while his mother looked after his younger sister.
""I was a stereotypical Manchester kid,"" he says. ""I'd spend most of my time trying to climb trees or something stupid, and come home with dirt all over my face, food all over my T-shirt.""
He wasn't particularly academic, leaving school with three GCSEs before studying sports science, with notions of becoming a PE teacher.
Music ended those plans - but his emergence as an MC was pretty haphazard. 
He first tried rapping as a joke, imitating a character from Scary Movie to make his mates laugh on the steps of an abandoned church where they'd hang out to drink.
It was there, in 2015, that one of Aitch's friends inadvertently launched his career.
""I was drunk in the park - I do not advise anyone to get drunk in the park, by the way, disclaimer - but I finally built up the courage to spit bars in front of everyone. 
""When I finished and we was watching the video back, I was like, 'Yes, sick, but that's just for us. Don't put that anywhere.' By the time I got home, the video's on YouTube and I was like, 'No! What are you doing to me?!' I was proper mad.""
He changed his mind when the clip got 10,000 views. ""which, at the time, for where I was from, was crazy"".
xt video got 20,000 views. Then the Straight Rhymez freestyle went viral, thanks to its tongue-in-cheek lyrics about dates in burger restaurants and cycling home with ""half a bottle of vodka in my pocket"".
Filmed outside his family home, the video was funny and authentic, with Aitch's rap style - slightly breathless, always catching up with the beat - showcasing his laid-back, conversational patter. 
Recorded as a throwaway introduction to his YouTube channel, it was the first song to get Aitch noticed outside Manchester.
""When the video entered London territory, it's like everyone's seen it at once,"" he recalls. ""I'd go on my comments section and see Stormzy, AJ, Ghetts, Chip...  It's all a big blur really.""
Record labels were interested too; and a deal with the Sony imprint Since 93 meant he could finally stop working as a labourer for his granddad.
me fast after that. 
A guest verse on Russ Million's viral Keisha & Becky Remix got him a top 10 single in May 2019, while the Young T & Bugsey collaboration Strike a Pose went to number nine a month later. By August, the lascivious Taste (Make It Shake) became his first solo hit, peaking at number two.
He almost threw a spanner in the works during a 2020 radio interview, where he declared: ""I promise you now, no one younger than me is bothered about grime"".
A flurry of tweets followed, with Wiley and Lethal Bizzle calling his comments ""disrespectful"". 
""If grime's not here, we don't exist,"" Lethal Bizzle protested. ""I don't exist, you don't exist, everybody doing black urban street music doesn't exist. Think about what you're saying.""
Aitch's response has always been to acknowledge his deep love of grime (Wiley's Eskimo is one of the first beats he rapped over) while insisting that UK rap is evolving beyond its inner city roots.
""We always say you can judge your fanbase by an airport run,"" he says. ""And I get 13-year-olds, 45-year-olds, people's grandmas, people's sons. It's a wide range, so I felt like I needed to appeal to everyone.""
His album makes that explicit. Fuego and Bring It Back contain the skeletal beats of grime, but other tracks lean more heavily into pop-rap, from the Gorillaz sound-alike In Disguise to the children's choir on Close To Home.
1989 is Atich's homage to Manchester, cannily sampling The Stone Roses' Fools Gold as he drawls: ""Took the city and I made it mine / Put my shades on and rave like it's '89.""
It's his way of staking a claim to the city's musical legacy.
""Ask anyone if they know Aitch, and if they say 'Yes', ask them where he's from. They'll all say Manchester,"" he says.
But his status as the city's poster boy unravelled last week when a local mural of Joy Division's Ian Curtis was painted over to promote his album.
""It's annoying because I don't have any control over it,"" he says. ""I don't decide where to put the billboards, they just turn up.
""As soon as we got wind of it, we told them to stop, take it all down and then got hold of the artist who originally done that Ian [mural]. We're gonna get him to re-do it.""
His response was praised by the surviving members of Joy Division. ""Thank you, great gesture,"" wrote Peter Hook on Twitter; while Bernard Sumner added: ""Aitch said he's going to put it right... no harm done"".
Aitch hadn't seen their statements when we spoke last Friday, but seemed satisfied when they were read to him. 
""As long as I've got their approval then it's all good.""
He's such an affable, upbeat character that it's hard to imagine him ever seeing anything but the bright  - but his album's opening track suggests fame has come with major downsides.
""Sitting on my throne with an open stare / 'cause to me it's just a broken chair,"" he raps. ""I love it at the top, but it's cold up there.""
rics first appeared on his Instagram page last year, followed by an announcement he was taking a break. It prompted some hysterical parts of the media to proclaim he'd quit music but, looking back, he says he was ""just daydreaming"".
""I'm not the type of person to always be expressing my problems to everyone, so I felt the only way to do it was to make a song about it.""
In any case, he says, he could never quit music. 
""I always beg for time off and, when I finally get some, by the second day, I'm like, 'Oh, what am I even doing?'
""I don't really think it's good thing for anyone to have too much time on your hands. I always need to be busy, or at least doing something active, even if it's going to play football.""
More often than not, he ends up in the studio listening to beats with his producer WhyJay. On Baby, he admits his work focus makes it hard to maintain personal relationships.
""I'm not where I want to be yet,"" he says. I've still got goals to achieve. And then you get into a relationship and 50% of your time gets chopped straight away. So yeah, that song's just about trying to make it work and, unfortunately, it not ending up working.""
will come as tragic news to the lovestruck fans who, in the comments under his first video, still debate whether Aitch looks better with long hair or a shaved head.
""I think I'd go shaved head, personally,"" he laughs. ""I do miss the long hair, though. I do wish I still had it sometimes.
""Maybe on album three. Down to the shoulders, all that stuff. 100%."""	/news/entertainment-arts-62632343

entertainment	Rex Orange County: Singer has sexual assault charges dropped before trial	"Rex Orange County has had sex assault charges against him dropped, shortly before he was due to stand trial.
rt-topping singer-songwriter, real name Alexander O'Connor, from Surrey, had faced six charges of touching a woman without consent.
But on Thursday, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the evidence ""no longer met"" its test for a prosecution.
O'Connor, who denied the allegations, said it had been ""a difficult time for everyone involved"".
In a statement on Instagram, he wrote: ""Today, all charges against me have been dropped.
""The Crown Prosecution Service reviewed the evidence and decided that there is no merit in this case going to trial. Not guilty verdicts were entered to all the charges.
""I have always denied these allegations and am grateful that the independent evidence has cleared me of any wrongdoing. 
""I have never assaulted anyone and I do not condone violence or abusive behaviour of any kind.""
He also addressed ""inaccuracies"" that he said had circulated about his case. 
""I was wrongly accused of touching someone one evening on their leg, neck, back, and bottom,"" he said.
""That led to six charges of sexual assault. The only evidence against me was the individual's account.
""However, CCTV footage obtained by the police contradicted their version of events. Their partner was also present throughout the evening in question and gave a statement to the police, which did not support the allegations against me.
""It's been a difficult time for everyone involved and I'd like to thank the people who have helped me through it, as well as my family and loved ones for their continued support.""
A CPS spokesperson said: ""CPS prosecutors have a duty to keep each case under review. Having carefully considered all the evidence, our legal test for a prosecution was no longer met and so we will not be continuing a prosecution.
""We will always seek to prosecute sexual offences, where our legal test is met, no matter how challenging.""
Rex Orange County's third studio album went to number one in the UK this March.
He cancelled tour dates in July, saying, ""due to unforeseen personal circumstances, I am having to spend some time at home this year"", and news of the charges emerged in October."	/news/entertainment-arts-64063665
entertainment	Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar and Adele dominate Grammy Award nominations	"Beyoncé and Adele are the stars to beat at the 2023 Grammy Awards, and will go head-to-head for all the major prizes.
Both artists have been nominated for album of the year - Adele for her sumptuous fourth album 30, and Beyoncé for her dancefloor opus Renaissance.
Adele's single Easy On Me and Beyoncé's Break My Soul are each up for song and record of the year.
British stars Harry Styles and Coldplay are also in the running for best album, alongside Swedish pop icons Abba.
quartet have received their first ever album of the year nomination for last year's Voyage - which saw them emerge from a 39-year hibernation.
minations were announced on Tuesday, and Beyoncé leads the pack with nine overall - including nods in the dance and R&B categories.
She is now tied with her husband Jay-Z as the most-nominated artist in Grammy history, with a total of 88, overtaking Sir Paul McCartney and Quincy Jones.
However, the star has not won a prize in any of the three biggest categories (album, record and song of the year) since Single Ladies was named song of the year in 2010.
But if she collects four (or more) awards next February, she will beat conductor Sir George Solti's all-time record of 31 Grammys.
Kendrick Lamar is this year's second biggest nominee, with eight nods for his fourth album Mr Morale and the Big Steppers - a pensive rumination on the state of the world and his own moral failings - and the freestyle The Heart Part 5.
Adele and country star Brandi Carli are tied in third place, with seven nominations each.
r Swift has received multiple nominations for her epic re-recording of 2012's All Too Well, but her latest album, Midnights, was released too late for inclusion in the 2023 field.
And Puerto Rican rapper and singer Bad Bunny has made history by landing the first ever album of the year nomination for a Spanish language album.
His record, Un Verano Sin Ti (A Summer Without You), dominated the US Billboard charts this summer, racking up 13 weeks at number one.
British artists have had a particularly strong year. Along with Adele, Harry Styles has nominations for album of the year (Harry's House) as well as record and song of the year (As It Was). 
Ozzy Osbourne picks up several nominations in the rock categories for his solo record Patient Number 9; while the Isle Of Wight duo Wet Leg get a nod for best new act.
Drake and The Weeknd, who would have been likely frontrunners in the main categories, withdrew their latest albums from consideration. Both artists have long maintained, with some justification, that the Grammys sideline black artists to genre-based categories.
Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, whose side project Silk Sonic also declined to submit their album. Rather than criticise the voters, however, Mars said it ""would be crazy to ask for anything more"" after winning song and record of the year for Leave The Door Open at this year's ceremony.
Last month, the rapper Nicki Minaj protested that her hit song Super Freaky Girl had been moved from rap to the pop categories during the shortlisting process. In the end, it failed to pick up any nominations.
Other snubs included Elton John, whose hit collaboration with Dua Lipa, Cold Heart, was expected to pick up a nomination for best pop duo/group performance; and Ed Sheeran, whose fifth album = was completely overlooked.
But the Grammys can be strangely cautious of mainstream success. At this year's ceremony, for example, Jon Batiste won album of the year for the handsome soul record We Are, beating big sellers like Olivia Rodrigo's Sour and Lil Nas X's Montero. 
His victory reinforced the perception that Grammy voters care more about tradition and musical chops than innovation and commercial performance - something many former nominees have grumbled about. 
However, that could change this year, after almost 2,000 new members joined the voting organisation, 44% of whom come ""from traditionally underrepresented communities,"" according to the Recording Academy. ""And almost 50% are under the age of 40,"" noted chief executive, Harvey Mason Jr.
minees were announced in a livestream from the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles by former winners including Olivia Rodrigo, Cyndi Lauper and John Legend.
Here's a rundown of the major categories, and who might stand to win at the ceremony on 5 February, 2023.
re is the repeat of 2017's best album race, in which Adele's 25 controversially beat Beyoncé's Lemonade. 
On stage, Adele said: ""I can't possibly accept this award. I'm very humbled and very grateful and gracious but my life is Beyoncé."" In the end, she held on to the trophy - but when it arrived in the mail it was broken in two. That's symbolism.
So who will take top honours this time? Beyoncé's Renaissance is undoubtedly the better album - a bold blast of dancefloor catharsis, which champions the black and queer roots of house music. But Grammy voters often play it safe, choosing ""traditional"" songcraft over innovation. 
my's membership has been revamped since the upset of 2017, potentially tipping the balance in Beyoncé's favour. But Adele has won all 13 Grammys she's been nominated for since 2012.
r Swift's sixth song of the year nomination - meaning she now ties with Sir Paul McCartney and Lionel Richie as the category's most-nominated writer. The recognition comes for All To Well, a break-up ballad that originally appeared on her 2012 album Red, but was re-recorded with extra verses (and extra juicy details) last year.
However, Swift has never won best song - and her competition this year is especially tough. 
Adele's comeback Easy On Me is the presumed frontrunner: A big blustery ballad, it sold more in the US than her previous song of the year winner, Hello, and spent 10 weeks at number one.
Harry Styles can beat that, though. As It Was, a pop song whose nimble melody disguises lyrics about loneliness and doubt, enjoyed 15 weeks atop the US charts earlier this year. 
While the song of the year award recognises music and lyrics, record of the year looks at the finished product - the actual sound recording. 
However, there's significant crossover between the categories, with Adele, Beyoncé, Lizzo and Styles all picking up duplicate nominations.
Once again, Adele leads the pack, but Lizzo's outrageously charismatic About Damn Time could be a contender.
Meanwhile, Swedish pop legends Abba gained a surprise nomination for Don't Shut Me Down, taken from their comeback album Voyage. 
umptuously-recorded vocals alone could be enough to earn them a Grammy award - which would be the band's first.
Most years provide a breakout star whose victory in the best new artist category seems nailed on. Last year it was Olivia Rodrigo. This year, it's an entirely open field.
Predicted nominations for rapper Jack Harlow and singer-songwriter Gayle failed to materialise, despite nominations in other categories.
As a result, the smart money is on Atlanta rapper Latto, thanks to her breakout hit Big Energy, for which she bagged a guest appearance from music legend Mariah Carey. 
Meanwhile, former Eurovision winners Maneskin have made huge inroads in the US, and British indie duo Wet Leg are building a sizeable audience for quirky hits like Chaise Longue and Ur Mum.
re's also a big opportunity for Brazilian star Anitta - who has had a breakthrough year in the States, after releasing her fifth album, Versions Of Me, in April.
While her decade-long career might seem grounds for disqualification, the criteria for best new artist are fairly relaxed. 
Artists are eligible if they have broken into public consciousness over the past 12 months, even if they've received prior Grammy nominations.

66th festival, run by the British Film Institute (BFI), is being held at South Bank and runs until 16 October.
An adaptation of Roald Dahl's Matilda The Musical will kick-off the event, while Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery will be its closing film.
re will also be screenings at venues in 10 cities across the UK.
Festival director Tricia Tuttle said the opening and closing films were deliberately chosen to be a contrast to a lack of ""light stories"" in films this year. 
""There are some incredible films across the whole programme which are darker, more complex in terms of themes and stories, and take you to much darker places,"" she said.
""They're responding to the world that we live in, which is a pretty troubling place, and you see that in the cinema this year.""
She added the decision to begin the festival with Matilda The Musical ""felt very special"", because ""it's a really joyous story about underdogs getting their own back and it's a great female-centred story as well"".
Engaging new audiences is also a priority for this year's festival organisers, and the event has expanded its programme of free events to meet demand during the cost-of-living crisis.
re will be £5 tickets available for 16-25 year-olds and a free programme of events on offer, including short film screenings and online screen talks, including Hollywood actors Jennifer Lawrence and Bill Nighy.
An immersive programme will also return to the festival with its Expanded programme, ranging from interactive stories utilising iPads, to performance pieces that use augmented reality.
Among this year's films in the festival programme are: 
festival will be Tricia Tuttle's last, as she will step down as BFI festivals director after 10 years at the organisation.
Her goal for this year's event was to help revive film and cinema screenings, which she said had suffered a ""knock in the last couple of years"", following the global pandemic.
""The exhibition industry during the pandemic really suffered economically, a lot of independent cinemas are struggling, they're still struggling but you can see audiences coming back"", she said.
""I just would love if the festival helps to reinvigorate that excitement with audiences and we remember that it's great to have infinite choice at home but watching something collectively in a cinema is also really an incredible special experience.""

entertainment	'Homage' to Cromer Pier premiers at Cambridge Film Festival	"A German documentary maker's trip to a English seaside variety show has inspired him to make a film about it.
Seaside Special is a film about one of Britain's remaining end-of-the-pier variety shows in Cromer, Norfolk.
Its director, Jens Meurer, said the film was an ""homage"" to the show he had ""fallen in love"" with 10 years ago when his in-laws took him to see it.
umentary has premiered at the Cambridge Film Festival.
Mr Meurer said the show was ""not about becoming super-famous"", but it was about ""entertaining the 500 people who were in that amazing Victorian theatre twice a day"".
""My desire to capture this world on camera finally fell into place in 2019 - the year when Brexit came to a head and just before the pandemic struck,"" he said.
He said he wanted to film the ""most British place I know"" and the ""kind of British-ness we miss"".

entertainment	Rare Jane Austen books could sell for £100,000	"A set of five first-edition Jane Austen novels could sell for more than £100,000 at auction. 
ks were bought by a UK-based private collector in the 1970s and 1980s for about £5,000.
re now due to be sold at auction in Gloucestershire by the daughter of the collector.
rarest of the five books is Sense and Sensibility as fewer than 1,000 were printed when it was first published anonymously in 1811.
Chris Albury, auctioneer and senior valuer at Dominic Winter Auctions in Cirencester, said: ""The current owner remembers her mother being particularly anxious one time after she had bought one of the books for £2,000 and told her husband to cancel the cheque that night.
""He wisely, in a long-term investment sense, said no. 
""She was a great fan of Jane Austen but these were the only rare books she ever bought and they would be brought out every now and then, treated carefully by the family, and then put back in the bookcase.
""We estimate she would have paid no more than £5,000 for all of these back then and they are now expected to fetch over £100,000.
""The daughter has had these for many years now and has decided to sell them through auction and let others get the pleasure from them and use the money for new projects and plans.""
Also being sold is a copy of Pride and Prejudice, which was published in 1813 in an edition of approximately 1,500 copies.
Mansfield Park was released the following year and Emma was published in 1816 - each in editions of 1,250 copies.
Finally, published a year after Austen's death in 1817, came Northanger Abbey and Persuasion in a run of 1,750 copies.
""The first four were published in triple decker format, three-volume sets that became standard practice for novels put out by British publishers in the 19th Century - cleverly forcing the new breed of fiction readers to pay for each novel three times,"" Mr Albury said.
He said first copies of Pride and Prejudice were the most sought-after by collectors, while Sense and Sensibility was valuable because of its rarity.
Mr Albury said interest in the auction, on 15 December, had come from transatlantic book dealers and ""seasoned Austen collectors looking to fill gaps in their collections"".

entertainment	River City marks 20th anniversary with special episode	"first episode of River City aired on BBC Scotland on 24 September 2002.
Since then, it has transmitted 1344 episodes, and had 19 weddings, 11 births, 46 deaths and 22 murders.
w's villain Lenny Murdoch has had 13 attempts on his life. Nine of those ""killed"" off, will return in a special anniversary episode which will be available from Monday.
BBC Scotland's flagship soap has launched hundreds of careers and is a training ground for television talent.
Series producer Martin McCardie, started out as an actor.
""I played Lenny Murdoch's friend, arrested in the first season,"" he said. ""Technically I'm still in jail.""
He returned as a writer in 2005 and said the show had lasted for 20 years because it was able to adapt.
""It's went through a lot of different incarnations"", he said.
""Going from half hours to hours, back to half hours again, different writers, different actors, different stories, different ways of doing it, and that's one of the reasons it's lasted because it has changed and adapted as it's gone along.""
Over the years, River City has both helped launch careers - such as Outlander's Sam Heughan - and also hosted established actors on its set in Dumbarton such as Stefan Dennis, known for playing Paul Robinson in Neighbours.
Una MacLean, Dawn Steele and Alison Peebles have all played key roles. Susan Boyle, Lorraine Kelly and Judy Murray have all had cameos.
Although some people have been able to use the programme as a stepping stone into other work, it has also been valuable at keeping Scottish talent in Scotland.
Mr McCardie said: """"For somebody like me, when my family were small, when they were growing up I wanted to work in Scotland and a lot of my time before that was working elsewhere.
""This place gave me the opportunity to work in Scotland and be here for my children growing up and that's a massive thing for me that I was able to do that because of River City.""
It is not just onscreen where change has taken place. River City has become an important part of the screen industry. 
A report by Screen Scotland in June showed the TV and film industry contributed almost £568m to Scotland's economy in 2019 and the Scottish government hopes that can double to £1bn by the end of the decade.
""There's more work in Scotland than I've ever known in my lifetime in television and television drama and that's challenging for us,"" says Mr McCardie.
""We bring people through and then they move on to those other shows as well so we've got to continually bring people through the system, we have to plan that ahead. 
""You're always looking for new writers, new camera operators, you're looking for DOPs (directors of photography), you're looking at succession planning all the way through.""
A 20th anniversary episode will be aired at 22:00 on Monday as part of the celebrations. 
-off special see Bob drinking from a mystical bottle of alcohol and waking up with his best friend Angus, in a multiverse where many of the lost friends from their past still exist. 
Stephen Purdon, who plays Bob, is the only original cast member from 2002 still working on River City. 
He said: ""I was just kind of in and out every few episodes, every two or three episodes coming in for a bit of comedy relief.""
Having started the role at the age of 19, he said it's ""overwhelming and humbling"" to take such a central role in the anniversary episode.
""When I look back to my younger self still living with my mum and coming here as a young boy and to think now that I'm married with two kids and I've been here 20 years, I guess it's mind-blowing when I say that actually.
""Bob has grown up as a character and I've grown up as a person as well."""	/news/uk-scotland-63007493
entertainment	A Little Life: James Norton to star in 'devastating' stage adaptation	"A novel which developed a passionate following among young audiences will be adapted for the stage in a new West End production starring James Norton.
A Little Life, by Hanya Yanagihara, follows four classmates from a small US college who move to New York to pursue their careers. It deals with complex themes including abuse, race, privilege, sexuality, friendship and addiction.
was shortlisted for the Booker Prize 2015. It did not win, but became a word-of-mouth hit after striking a chord with younger people - something which can rarely be said for the kinds of books normally shortlisted for the prestigious literature prize. 
A Little Life's devoted fanbase includes singer Dua Lipa, who interviewed Yanagihara for her podcast, telling her the book had ""changed her life"".
ge adaptation will play for 12 weeks at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London from 25 March. The West End premiere will mark the show's English-language debut - its director Ivo van Hove has previously only staged it in Dutch.
""The book is a kind of a mystery, because it became a huge bestseller,"" he tells BBC News. ""It's a little bit strange because it talks about cruel things, about a traumatic experience that haunts somebody for the rest of his life.""
""But after all these years, every night, theatres are full, people are moved, sometimes angry, but it creates a very visceral reaction towards it.""
Sales of the novel, Yanagihara's second, were modest following its publication - but it gradually became popular via word-of-mouth, ultimately selling more than 2.5 million copies. (For context, the author's 2013 debut, The People in the Trees, had sold only a few thousand copies.)
ge adaptation of A Little Life will star Norton - who is known for McMafia and Happy Valley - alongside It's A Sin star Omari Douglas, Bridgerton's Luke Thompson and The Witcher's Zach Wyatt. 
Dutch version played four performances (with English surtitles) at the Edinburgh Festival this year. It enjoyed warm reviews from critics, despite its often grim subject matter.
graph awarded it five stars, saying in its review: ""This devastating play is emotionally gruelling. But that doesn't detract from how transfixing and heartrending it is.""
re was agreement from the Guardian, which described the play as ""mesmerising"" in its four-star review, but added: ""This is not a show for the faint-hearted.""
Some critics also noted that the four-hour runtime could put off ticket-buyers. 
Van Hove says the West End version will be slightly shorter, at 3hrs 40mins, but points out there is so much material to reproduce. ""The book is 720 pages,"" he points out, ""but it is a page-turner.""
Norton, Douglas, Thompson and Wyatt will play the four friends at the centre of the book - prodigious lawyer Jude, struggling artist JB, aspiring actor Willem, and successful architect Malcolm, respectively.
""I think I have a very good team of actors,"" says van Hove. ""I really took my time to talk to people, do auditions, because it's very intense to play it, and I hope I have found a group that can trust each other.""
I am afraid to say that I approached Hanya Yanagihara's A Little Life with trepidation. A 720-page doorstopper of a book by a writer I had not come across. 
How wrong I was. 
I devoured this story of four male friends living in New York and the dark secrets of child abuse and self-harm in the life of one of them, Jude.
Yanagihara certainly makes her characters suffer. Drink, drugs, rape and amputation also feature. 
""The book is not cheerful,"" she told me when I interviewed her in 2015 when the novel was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. ""But I hope it doesn't feel like a piling on of miseries for the sake of misery.""
Some readers, I am well aware, may find A Little Life oppressive and depressing. At times it is melodramatic too. 
But for me, it was an immersive and intimate reading experience. ""I did want it to feel like a walled garden, a place that you couldn't get out of,"" said Yanagihara. 
And I thought one of the book's great strengths was its depiction of the interior lives of the characters. Yanagihara takes you deeply into the thoughts and feelings of the mysterious Jude and his friends Willem, Malcolm and JB. 
So I am intrigued to see how that can be reproduced in the theatre. 
When we spoke a stage adaptation was not on the cards, but Yanagihara did tell me she did not think A Little Life could ""exist"" as a film. 
But, she revealed: ""I would love to have it made as a mini-series. I think a middle aged Jude would be very good with Christian Bale in the role. But I also like the American actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt.""
Van Hove says it is his ""dream"" to stage the play in English, adding: ""I'm really looking forward to seeing how it will work when it's in the original language, that's a prospect that I cannot wait to start.""
Yanagihara says she is ""thrilled"" that the production was heading to London, describing it as having ""the most extraordinary cast I could have hoped for"". 
Given the book tapped into a younger demographic, does van Hove expect the play will attract larger numbers of the young people theatre sometimes struggles to reach?
""That happened actually when we did it in Amsterdam,"" he replies, ""a lot of young people came to it."" Van Hove recalls the reaction of some young actors he was working with when they found out he was involved.
""I was doing West Side Story and there were a lot of people who were 17 or 18 in the cast, and lots of them were reading the book,"" he remembers. ""When they discovered I had done it they almost fainted.
""It has the potential to attract a diversity of people, because the cast is also culturally diverse - it's very close to the book."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63663348

""It's just that I can relate to her,"" she added.

entertainment	Misogyny in music: Few women report discrimination in industry, inquiry hears	"An inquiry into misogyny in music has heard how the #MeToo movement has not infiltrated the industry to the same degree it has with the film business.
During a first parliamentary evidence session on Wednesday, experts said few women in music reported misogyny.
MPs also heard little action was taken against those accused of sexism.
quiry is part of the House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee's efforts in preventing violence against women and girls.
Dr Cassandra Jones, lecturer in criminology at the University of Northumbria said ""the very nature of the music industry itself"" made it ""rife for toxic workplace behaviours"".
""There is something unique about the music industry that the Me Too movement hasn't really penetrated to the same extent that it has like the film industry,"" Dr Jones commented.
#MeToo campaign being a global talking point in 2017 as people used the hashtag to share their experiences of sexual harassment.
""Of the 20% who did report [misogyny in the music industry], nothing would happen,"" Dr Jones added. ""In some instances, their career was hurt and they were issued with an non-disclosure agreement or a cease and desist.
""So when that happens to one woman and then another woman sees this, they'll often think, 'well why should I report look what happened to her'.""
Dr Jones went on to say there is currently ""no accountability for perpetrators"", and that there ""needs to be something that oversees or scrutinises or monitors the music industry that has legal statutes behind it"".
At the same inquiry, Charisse Beaumont, chief executive of the Black Lives in Music (BLiM) initiative, compared the music industry to ""the wild west"", saying there is no central place to report bad behaviour.
She suggested less than 5% of music producers are female and that the gender imbalance, and ""male gaze"", translated into a misogynistic culture.
""I think there could be more signposting, more obvious ways of showing that there will be a consequence for the perpetrator and that you're going to be protected and safe,"" she said.
Last year, a BLiM report found that racism in the British music industry was ""serious, upfront and personal"".
Beaumont stressed how black women are discriminated against twice - for their gender and race - and often feel the need to change themselves in order to be accepted.
But she noted how the success of recent Mercury Prize and Brit Award-winner Little Simz highlights how it is possible to ""be your authentic self"" as a black woman in the music industry.
""What I want to hammer home is the director of marketing who handles Little Simz is a black woman,"" she told the committee. ""She knows exactly what to do with an artist like Little Simz, meaning it can be done.""
During the inquiry, Beaumont announced the launch of an industry wide anti-racism code of conduct, endorsed by the Independent Standards Authority (ISA).
move, which will come into place in spring 2023, intends to raise standards and tackle discriminatory behaviour and micro-aggressions, as well as providing support mechanisms for staff and mandatory anti-racism training.
She said it would also look into equal pay and contracts, career progression and achieving proportionate representation for artists and technical/production workers.
Dr Nicola Puckey, senior lecturer in English, creative writing and American studies at the University of Winchester, pointed to the rapid rise of another Mercury Prize nominated act, indie band Wet Leg, as an example of how we are ""slowly"" seeing more diversity in the traditionally male dominated industry.
urrent state of play, however, means listeners only hear ""half the story"", according to Dr Rosemary Hill, senior lecturer in media and popular culture at the University of Huddersfield.
""We should be able to hear ourselves reflected in the songs that we listen to and what we want to sing along with,"" she noted, while giving evidence.
""We also need to acknowledge that sometimes the way that men portray women in songs is not how we would like to see ourselves portrayed so it is really important to hear women's stories and to hear the different things we have to say about the world and reflect our different experiences.""
More evidence is expected to be presented to the ongoing inquiry in 2023."	/news/entertainment-arts-63410117
entertainment	Newcastle has 'right balance' over festival noise after row	"A crackdown on noise from festivals held on Newcastle's Town Moor is proof major events can be staged without being a nuisance, a council has said.
Following complaints about the This is Tomorrow concerts last year, controls were put in place limiting activity in Exhibition Park and Leazes Park.
Councillors heard that three big festivals this summer attracted far fewer complaints than had been feared.
uncil was told Newcastle had an ""exemplary"" template for future events.
Exhibition Park furore sparked a row between local authority officials and the charity which runs the city's green spaces, Urban Green Newcastle.
r claimed tougher noise limits would make it impossible to stage large events, severing a critical source of income, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. 
Civic centre bosses had warned that residents could be subjected to ""10 hours of repetitive bass music"" from the two-day LooseFest. 
wn Moor also played host to the Rock n Roll Circus in June and UK Pride in July.
Ed Foster, the council's head of public safety and regulation, said the three festivals combined attracted fewer than 20 complaints, while This is Tomorrow in 2021 had provoked more than 90.
Rock n Roll Circus, headlined by Noel Gallagher, had no complaints and nearby residents ""hardly knew it was there"", the council was told.
Pride had six noise complaints and LooseFest 13, though Mr Foster said the latter had complied with noise limits on its stages but experienced unexpected nuisance from its fairground.
""I believe we have listened... and reduced the noise significantly from major events,"" he said.
""It is when we have events that are community-led that they can't afford it. Pride cannot afford the same systems as Loosefest, but we try to achieve the best standard and it is a difficult road to tread. 
""But I do believe we have got the balance right.""
His comments came in response to Labour's Rob Higgins, who said the council risked being perceived as ""heavy-handed"" and deterring event organisers.

Balenciaga's removed the images and says it is taking action over one photoshoot.
Balenciaga is regarded as one of the ""world's hottest brands"" by some and its luxury goods are a favourite of A-listers and influencers.
But photos from two of its latest campaigns caused people to get angry.
first was a series of images showing child models posing with the company's plush bear bags.
r-inspired accessories look like soft toys - but appear to be wearing leather harnesses and other items associated with bondage fetishes.
wo of the pictures showed young children hugging the backpacks.
Critics then locked on to a second image from an earlier, separate, campaign promoting the brand's collaboration with Adidas.
One of the pictures showed a handbag sitting on top of some documents.
When people zoomed in on the text it revealed the papers were from a US Supreme Court ruling related to indecent images of children.
Balenciaga started posting the images to its social media feeds on 16 November.

Balenciaga also apologised for displaying ""unsettling documents"" in the Adidas collaboration campaign.
""The two separate ad campaigns in question reflect a series of grievous errors for which Balenciaga takes responsibility,"" it said.
mpany said it was carrying out investigations and strengthening checks and controls around its creative processes.
It added: ""We want to learn from our mistakes and identify ways we can contribute.""
Gabriele Galimberti also pointed out that he was not connected to the Adidas photoshoot.
Kim Kardashian was also criticised over the images - or, rather, for staying silent about them.
reality star is an ambassador for the brand and the two regularly work together - but she did not comment on the scandal until Sunday.
Posting to her Instagram stories and Twitter, she said she had been ""shaken by the disturbing images"" and ""any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society — period.""
She said her silence was not down to a lack of disgust and outrage, but because she wanted to speak to Balenciaga to ""understand for myself how this could have happened.""
Commending the brand for removing the campaigns and apologising, she said she was ""re-evaluating"" her relationship with the company.
But she told followers she believed the brand understood the seriousness of the issue and it would take steps to make sure it would ""never happen again"".

entertainment	Megan Thee Stallion testifies Tory Lanez shot her	"Megan Thee Stallion has described in emotional courtroom testimony her ""shock"" as fellow rapper Tory Lanez allegedly opened fire on her. 
""I can't believe I have to come here and do this,"" she told a jury in Los Angeles. 
Grammy-winning rapper said she was shot in the feet after leaving a pool party at Kylie Jenner's house.
Jurors heard she insulted the accused and demanded to be let out of a luxury car before he fired five rounds at her.
rapper, whose real name is Megan Pete, 27, testified that her alleged attacker became enraged after she disparaged his musical talent. 
She said the 30-year-old defendant, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, had told her to ""dance"" before opening fire in the incident in the Hollywood Hills on 12 July 2020. 
He denies multiple gun and assault charges relating to a dispute with the Savage artist. If found guilty, he faces up to 23 years in prison. 
""I'm in shock. I'm scared. I hear the gun going off, and I can't believe he's shooting at me,"" she told the court on Tuesday, the second day of the trial, according to the LA Times. 
She became tearful on the witness stand, expressing regret for ever having come forward about the incident.
""I wish he would've just shot and killed me if I knew I was going to have to go through this torture,"" she told the court.
WAP rapper left a trail of blood at the scene, before getting back into the vehicle, which was stopped minutes later by police.
A gun that was still warm to the touch was found on the floor near where Mr Peterson had been sitting, prosecutor Alexander Bott said in his opening statement.
Megan Thee Stallion testified that the Canadian hip-hop artist had offered her $1m to keep quiet about the attack because he claimed to be on probation for a weapons offence.
She initially said to police that she had cut her feet on glass.
But she told the court on Tuesday she had lied because of concerns about how the police would react, especially amid nationwide racial justice unrest in the summer of 2020. 
""At the time, we are at the height of police brutality,"" she testified, ""I felt like if I said this man has just shot me, they might shoot first and ask questions later."" 
Minutes after the shooting, a female friend who was in the car texted Megan Thee Stallion's security detail, saying: ""Help... Tory shot meg."" 
Several bullet fragments were removed from her feet, but some remain and she told investigating officers that she had difficulty walking in certain shoes.
In a phone call, Mr Peterson had ""profusely apologised for his actions"" and claimed he was ""just too drunk"", prosecutors said.
His lawyer, George Mgdesyan, said the jury needed to keep an open mind and he would prove the accusations were lies.

entertainment	Taylor Swift: Midnights praised by critics despite lack of radio hits	"r Swift's new album has been met with rave reviews from critics, although some said its subdued tone means it lacks potential hit singles.
Midnights, the singer's 10th original studio album, was awarded five stars by both the Guardian and the Independent.
Guardian said Midnights is a ""cool, collected and mature"" record which is ""packed with fantastic songs"".
But some criticised the lack of radio hits, with the Evening Standard noting there is ""not a smash hit in sight"".
Swift is currently re-recording her early records due to a dispute with music mogul Scooter Braun, but has paused that process to release a new album of original material. 
Midnights is the 32-year-old's first original album in two years and sees her return to a more mainstream sound than the somewhat muted, acoustic tone of her previous two albums.
Her new record retains some of the folksy charm of sister albums Folklore and Evermore, both released in 2020 during the pandemic. But it also sees her re-engage her pop sensibilities, with lyrics that explore more personal subject matters.
Some songs offer fans further insight into the star's normally low-key relationship with her boyfriend, English actor Joe Alwyn.
Swift previously described the album as ""stories of 13 sleepless nights, scattered throughout my life"". 
In a five-star review, the Guardian's Alexis Petridis said Midnights ""delivers her firmly from what she called the 'folklorian woods' of her last two albums back to electronic pop"". 
""There are filtered synth tones, swoops of dubstep-influenced bass, trap and house-inspired beats and effects that warp her voice to a point of androgyny,"" he noted. 
""Confidence is the thing that binds Midnights together. There's a sure-footedness about Swift's songwriting, filled with subtle, brilliant touches.""
Independent's Helen Brown also awarded five stars, writing: ""Over a series of murky electronic grooves (mostly co-written with Jack Antonoff), the pop star unpacks her darkest dreams, deepest doubts and cruellest thoughts. All the while she keeps things just cryptic enough to keep the tension crackling and the speculation buzzing.
""The subtle melodies of Midnights take time to sink their claws in,"" she added. ""But Swift's feline vocal stealth and assured lyrical control ensure she keeps your attention. Turn the lights off and let these songs prowl around you. Just don't expect their meanings to settle too biddably into your lap. Swift's always as elusive as she is allusive.""
However, the Evening Standard's David Smyth was significantly less enthusiastic, awarding the album just two stars.
""It's hard to spot anything that sounds like a smash hit on Swift's third muted collection in a row,"" he wrote.
""While the style is a change from Folklore and Evermore, Swift is never at the ball when the clock strikes 12. On the twinkly Bejeweled she announces that she's 'going out tonight', but the beats remain sleepy and sluggish.
""The brighter Karma, presumably another dig at Braun, is the only song that feels like it could be a highlight when she eventually returns to the stage. Otherwise Midnights sounds ready for bed.""
But Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos argued that a subtle return to form has resulted in an improved quality of songwriting from the star.
""As Swift has returned to her archive for to undertake the project of re-recording her previous albums, it's clear slipping back into her past self has unlocked something brilliant and fresh in her songwriting,"" she wrote. 
""Midnights may come as a surprise to the most newly turned fans of her music, those who only learned to like her songwriting when it came in the traditionally respectable Folklore/Evermore package.""
Swift is gearing up for a busy few months. She is hoping to be nominated for an Oscar in January, either for her short film All Too Well, or in the best original song category for her track Carolina, taken from Where The Crawdads Sing 
But Midnights will be her main focus for the next few months, with fans anticipating the announcement of a world tour in support of its release.
In a four-star review, the Times' Will Hodgkinson wrote: ""Swift has said she intended Midnights as a concept piece based on 13 nights of troubled sleep, and these variously minimal, eerie, heartfelt and intense songs do have a crepuscular quality that is out of keeping with her usual cheery brightness. 
""Sometimes, as on Labyrinth, the modish vocal treatments are off-putting, but in the main Midnights appeals because, for all its modern touches, it is essentially an old-fashioned singer-songwriter album about human weakness.""
NME's Hannah Mylrea wrote: ""After a foray into a different sonic world, on Swift's return to pure pop she still shimmers.
""She spins these new stories through sleek synth-pop, in common with [previous albums] 1989 or Lover, but the razor-sharp production of these albums is more subtle this time around.""
graph's Neil McCormick praised the album's ""sensuous electro-digital sound"" in his four-star review for the Telegraph, but also highlighted the lack of radio hits. 
""Yet despite the Prince-like falsetto funkiness of opening love song Lavender Haze and glib strut of Bejeweled (""When I walk in a room, I can still make the whole place shimmer"") there are no obvious chart-smashing bangers. 
""It is almost as if she has become too mature for the brand of meme-friendly, earworm pop with which she made her name."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63341633

entertainment	Cardiff: Reggae veteran hopes to create digital library	"Veterans of a once vibrant reggae scene in Cardiff have called for its revival following decades of decline.
It comes as one historian has made it his mission to archive the history of sound system culture online.
Sound systems - huge banks of speakers with MCs and rappers - led to the emergence of hip-hop in the UK.
Reggae historian Ashish Joshi has travelled the UK collecting old tapes and videos to create a digital library to keep the culture alive. 
He believes the culture hasn't been given the recognition it deserves and is hoping to attract a whole new fan base.
""Sound systems have been in existence since the 1950s and have spawned the dance and hip-hop music that you see in the present day,"" said Mr Joshi. 
Sound systems in the 1970s developed a distinctive British style and consisted of several members and developed a loyal following.
uded the manager - who often owned everything - MCs, engineers, selectors (people that selected the music), operators, ""box boys"" to pack things up and rappers. 
""The fans used to follow the sound systems like supporters follow football teams,"" added Mr Joshi.
""People didn't have the money to buy vinyl records one after another so instead they'd listen to these tapes which only cost a couple of quid and would capture the live essence of the sound system. 
""People would collect sound tapes from Cardiff to Jamaica. And that's why I'm collecting and collating them before they're thrown away.""
Reggae sound systems originated in Jamaica in 1950s with the first ones emerging in the UK in the 60s. 
gan playing dancehall and ska before moving onto reggae in the 70s, accompanied by a selector, operator and rapper. 
were a staple at carnivals in the 1970s and 80s, with more than 20,000 people descending on Butetown in Cardiff for the carnival every August.
Rival sound systems would set up their equipment competing in a ""sound clash"" to draw the biggest crowd.
Mr Joshi said sound systems were the only places to hear the latest reggae in Cardiff, as it was before the BBC or any mainstream radio stations would play the genre. 
""If they weren't around the fans could not hear all the hits coming out of Jamaica and London,"" he said. 
In the 60s and 70s sound systems started playing in clubs as more venues began playing reggae.  
New Ocean Club, on Rover Way between Splott and Tremorfa, The Paddle Steamer cafe, the Bosun pub, and the Casablanca nightclub in Butetown were important social gathering places for Cardiff's black community.  
Cardiff's reggae sound systems would engage in friendly musical competitions with visiting sound systems from other cities in the UK, including London, Birmingham and Huddersfield.
""reggae sound clashes"" would take place in various venues the fans would vote on the winner, based on musical selection, style and which sound system had the best rappers . 
Bingham, from Conqueror - a Cardiff sound system from the 70s - said the rivalry kept reggae ""fresh"", unlike the pop music of the time where there was no real rivalry.
""In reggae you have to earn respect and it was only the best ones which would make it on to a CD and it kept the competition healthy,"" he added. 
Bingham said times have changed now, and people no longer want to carry big boxes of speakers and amplifiers around.
""People carry around their equipment in a briefcase now. But you can't beat the sound systems because you feel the music,"" he said. 
""It was a loyal fan base because you represent your city and Conqueror was the sound of Cardiff.""
Beefy, also from Conqueror, said the sound system era was a ""very important time in Cardiff's musical history"".
""We played with some of greatest artists - Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs, Shabba Ranks. We played with them all back in the day,"" he said.  
""The Paddle Steamer cafe was the hub of the area but that's closed and when the carnival was on, you'd have nearly 30,000 people here. Now there's just a sprinkling of people attending the carnival.""
Sir Coxsone Outernational, from Brixton, were one of Britain's leading and most successful sound systems. In their heyday of the 70s and 80s they would travel to Cardiff to play.  
keep their edge, their star selector Festus would order the latest dubplates from top producers in Jamaica.
""I would air freight my records from Jamaica so it would only take one day for the tunes I wanted to reach England,"" he said. 
Festus added: ""I'd even travel to Jamaica to meet the producers and get the song before it's released to the public or the radio stations, one year or even two years before anyone else.
""Then I would bust the song and that's the way sound system works. That's why I'm the best, as I keep ahead.""
Countryman sound system formed in 1982 in Cardiff, and are one of only two still active in the city. 
""We went against the best and came out on top and we're still going. But it's difficult to get a gig now in a Cardiff club,"" said Countryman's Gary. 
, also from Countryman, added: ""It's the same old story in Cardiff, there's no black-owned nightclubs. It's difficult to push reggae then.""
""Many club owners still thinking back in the day it's all drugs, crime and violence but it's never been that. 
""We used to have the Casablanca in Cardiff, which was a black-owned nightclub but that's closed. That was the best place in Cardiff history for the black community.""
Mr Joshi wants young people today to be able experience this culture that has been so important for so many in Wales, and he thinks an online archive is the way to do it.

entertainment	Stoke-on-Trent painter documents Queen's funeral	"A painter said he ""just had to document"" the Queen's lying-in-state and funeral procession.
Rob Pointon, from Stoke-on-Trent, was granted special access to paint scenes during the period of mourning.
For the state funeral procession, he stood overnight on Whitehall to get a good pitch and spent three days painting the ""fleeting moment"" as the Queen's coffin passed by.
""The weight of the honour was enormous,"" he said.  
Describing his process, Mr Pointon said he set up early to ""build up a foundation of the painting"", starting with the street and adding in the crowd before the procession arrived.
""It happened so fleetingly and as the Royal Family are walking past you don't want to be manically throwing paint down,"" he said.
""It was a sombre moment, so I got the reference and painted some of the tweaks in the studio afterwards.""
Mr Pointon has previously painted the Household Cavalry and the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations but said he had ""never felt expectation on my work like that before"".
He was granted special permission to sketch for four hours during the Queen's lying-in-state and described the atmosphere as ""quite something"".
""[Painting] is a bit of a poetic form of documentation, it's all tweaked by the artist's will,"" he said. 
""It's different from photography, it's not that accurate I suppose, but you can communicate more sentiment and atmosphere in a painting than you might be able to in a photograph.""
In total he produced seven paintings, which he hopes to exhibit as a collection.
""I just went down to London knowing that I had to document it.""

Donated books had been left in the kiosk at Kilmore since 2016, after it was believed - mistakenly - the site had been purchased for the community.
Last week, books and shelves were found left in a pile behind the phone box.
BT said the payphone was still available for calls and for insurance reasons the kiosk could not be used for any other purpose.
ms giant said the items had to be removed so an engineer could access service panels.
Kilmore and Kilbride Community Council, however, said the donated items could have been treated with more respect.
Previous members of the council had mistakenly believed the phone box had been purchased from BT for a token fee of £1, and books have been left in the kiosk for the last six years. 
re is a notice inside the kiosk from August 2016 that says BT was consulting on the removal of the payphone due to the low usage.
Last week books and shelves were found dumped outside the kiosk, and new a notice had been put up inside to say the phone was still in use.
Community council secretary Sue Burden said: ""We would fully respect it that it is their property - it is just the way the donated items were dumped. People are upset about that.""
BT said its payphones provided an important service to some people and its engineers worked hard to maintain them. It said for insurance reasons, working kiosks could not be used for other purposes.

entertainment	Hollywood director Paul Feig calls for more NI film studios	"Northern Ireland's screen industry needs more film studios in order to grow, according to one of Hollywood's top directors.
Paul Feig has directed The School for Good and Evil, which is being released next week.
-adventure with an all-star cast was filmed at Belfast's Harbour Studios and across Northern Ireland.
It is based on Soman Chainani's novels about a school where children learn to be fairy tale heroes and villains.
Speaking to BBC News NI, Feig said Northern Ireland needed more ""stage space"" to attract more big productions.
""It's a chicken-and-egg thing because you need more things coming in, in order to build more production space and sound stages,"" he said.
""But you could use more sound stages, definitely.
""Belfast Harbour studios is beautiful, but it's two giant stages and we could have used another stage.""
He said the problem in the industry was that there is ""so much production because it used to be all just movie studios but now it's the streamers"".
""The streamers have taken over various studios in London and Budapest and all these places.
""If you can become the place that has all the stage space, has these great crews, great city to work in, that's going to make people start coming in.""
Blade Runner 2099, a TV series based on the iconic Blade Runner films, is soon to be filmed in Northern Ireland.
Northern Ireland Screen has a new four-year strategy to grow the TV, film and video game industries.
Feig started out as an actor, but has become a highly successful director and producer.
Among the films he has directed are hits like Bridesmaids and Last Christmas and episodes of TV series like Nurse Jackie, 30 Rock and Mad Men.
School for Good and Evil was Netflix's first major production in Northern Ireland and was filmed in 2021.
, in Feig's words, ""some heavy hitters"".

""And then we've got a whole bunch of amazing newcomers in Sophia Anne Caruso, Sofia Wylie, Jamie Flatters, Kit Young,"" Feig said.
""What's nice is when you get the two generations together, if they're real pros and really talented they just mesh and it's fun to watch them play.""
School for Good and Evil was filmed in Belfast's Harbour Studios, but also at locations such as St Anne's Cathedral, Mount Stewart in County Down and Big Dog Forest in County Fermanagh.
While the film has spectacular special effects, Feig said that filming on location was crucial.
""What I never want to do is get caught in a special-effects driven vortex, where you're in front of green screens and people are acting with tennis balls and all that stuff,"" he said.
""For this movie we tried to do as much as we could practically.
""We really loved being at Mount Stewart, which was great because we used that for a lot of the outside grounds.
""We have a whole scene around this beautiful pond out there so that was great.
""Then we were shooting in Big Dog Forest which was way, way out in the woods.
""So far in that most people said we probably couldn't even do it logistically, but it's so gorgeous.
""It's just so stunning that most people watching the movie will go: 'That's a special effect.'
""No, that is the real forest, that's how it looks.""
Paul Feig's film, The School for Good and Evil, was filmed in NI.
St Anne's Cathedral also features heavily in the film.
""It was so lovely that they let us take it over,"" Feig recalled.
""We were there for a good two weeks and really transformed the place, though it was this big, almost sound-stage type space but with so much detail."" 
But directing a major production is, according to Feig, an all-consuming role.
""I always say that when you're picking a project you're basically picking a spouse - you're going to do 24 hours a day, seven days a week, you're never going to stop thinking about this,"" he said.
""It's what you obsess about, that's why you have to be in love with the project you're doing.
""These big ones are logistical challenges, let's just say.""
Having filmed in Belfast in 2021 as lockdown was easing, Feig is keen to come back to see more.
""It was really only the last couple of weeks where the town opened up again,"" he said.
""My hope is that I can make another movie here... and then I'll just be out partying every night.""

health	Nottingham maternity review: About 1,000 people get in contact	"More than 750 families and over 200 staff have contacted an ongoing review of maternity services in Nottingham.
Midwife Donna Ockenden is leading a review into failings by Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust.
One of the families that fought alongside others for the review to take place said the numbers of people coming forward meant that parents who had felt ignored now had a voice.
rust said it was doing all it could to support the review.
review comes after dozens of babies died or were injured at hospitals run by the trust - the Queen's Medical Centre and Nottingham City Hospital.
Jack and Sarah Hawkins, whose daughter Harriet died in 2016, have led calls for an inquiry into failings.
Mrs Hawkins said: ""We said at the time there was a problem and frankly nobody listened to us.
""We were made to feel so lonely as if we were an isolated case. That was the case for a lot of people and now we have all come together.
""That feeling like you are on your own is one of the worst feelings ever. I'd just like to reach out to people and say if there's anything we can do, they can contact us families directly too.""
Mr Hawkins added: ""We've been part of a team of families that have shared this load.
""There are now a lot of us and that gives us a voice.""
Ms Ockenden was approached by families in Nottingham after chairing a review into the deaths of more than 200 babies at Shrewsbury in what was the UK's biggest maternity scandal.
Letters have now been sent to more than 1,000 families identifying them as having cases relevant to the Nottingham review.
Ms Ockenden said receiving these letters may be difficult for some families, but she encouraged them to respond and give their consent to join the review.
""It is really important to say that families must respond, because otherwise we can't have access to their medical records,"" she said.
""Clearly the larger the number of families where my expert team are able to look at the care received, it will have implications for the success of review, but most importantly it will help maternity services in Nottingham improve.""
She also encouraged further current and former members of staff to get in contact, and reassured them they would be kept anonymous.
""I think that some staff will perhaps feel frightened, they won't necessarily want to speak up, they may feel perhaps this review 'isn't as confidential as Donna says it is',"" she said.
""I give you my word that all off the communication that comes through to our review team is only seen by our review team.""
A spokesperson for NUH said: ""We are committed to making the necessary and sustainable improvements to our maternity services and this is why we will continue to do all we can to support the work of the independent review.""

health	Stroud: Women 'feel let down' by closure of postnatal beds	"Campaigners say they are receiving ""daily calls"" from women concerned about the suspension of a maternity unit's postnatal beds. 
Callers are said to be ""distressed"", ""angry"" and ""feeling let down"" by the changes at Stroud Maternity Unit. 
People can still give birth there but since October have been asked to leave within 12 hours.
rust says the move is due to a shortage of midwives and will be reviewed in January.
It also stressed it is committed to the long term future of the maternity unit. 
Kate Buckingham, chair of Stroud Maternity Matters, which represents patients and also works alongside the unit's midwives, said some women are choosing not to give birth at the unit.
""The accounts we hear from women is that they are distressed, they're angry and they're feeling let down,"" she said.  
""The beds have been part of their birth choices package and it's not just an optional extra or a satellite service. 
""This was core to their sense of empowerment and core to their sense that they would be able to birth in the way they wanted to.""
More than 6,800 people have signed a petition calling on the trust to reopen the six beds as a matter of urgency. 
Katerina Hasapopoulos, from Stroud, was hoping to recover in one of the beds after giving birth to her son Solomon in November, having used them after delivering her four older children.
""I've always stayed for a short period of time to get some respite and to recover from birth but most importantly to establish breastfeeding,"" she said.
""What about those who don't know what to expect and haven't breastfed before? 
""There's several new mums I know who have been sent home without knowing the basics of how to look after their child. 
""From how to change a nappy, to how to bathe baby, to different positions to breastfeed.""
Stroud's Conservative MP, Siobhan Baillie, used the postnatal beds after giving birth to both of her children, most recently in the summer. 
She said high-quality postnatal care is vital for women across Gloucestershire and the UK as a whole.
""It's not a fluffy issue, it's not a nice to have, it's not a luxury,"" she said. 
""For some women it's the difference of mental health recovery and their ability to not only parent their new baby but their other children. 
""And it can be life and death if maternity teams are able to spot things that are going on with the mother or the baby.""
She added she has raised the issue with the Secretary of State for Health, Steve Barclay.
Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was previously reviewing the measure on a weekly basis but has now said it will not consider reopening the beds until January. 
Chief executive Deborah Lee said: ""Thanks to a range of targeted initiatives from our dedicated midwifery recruitment team we have made significant progress over the summer in recruiting new midwives, with 14 new starters in October and a further seven being offered places in November. 
""However, staffing remains very challenging due to a combination of sickness, maternity leave, Covid-related sickness and an ongoing national shortage of midwives. 
""Given that it is unlikely that staffing levels will change sufficiently to enable us to reopen the service in the coming weeks, we have decided to move from a weekly review pattern, to a review in January.""

She said it was empowering to meet others where she could talk about it in a safe space.
roject, Motherhood in a climate crisis, was started by Sophia Cheng to help people share those difficult conversations.
People who take part talk about experiencing, considering or wanting to question motherhood due to climate issues.
Group sessions are tailored to what the participants want to focus on but in this workshop they created monologues, devised a collective theatre piece and worked alongside a therapist for support.
Ms Cheng said since its inception, she had ""never seen an outpouring of emotion quite like it"".
""They shared this flood of grief, blood, miscarriages and abortions. 
""There was a lot of laughter too. The kind of conversations that I hadn't spoken about for a long time."" 
rty-seven-year-old Rosanna Selway Spencer shared how she experienced a ""difficult internal struggle"" during the project.
""In the sessions I wrote a letter titled, 'to the second child I will never give birth to', and it was very cathartic.""
Ms Spencer said she wanted to have a second child, but her husband did not ""but since coming to this awareness of climate change, I changed my mind"".
""I had this deep sense of despair and grief around it. It's very frightening.
""I just don't know if I would've had a child if I'd have known this before?"" she added
'It was everything I've been scared of'
Ruby Pugh, 31, from Bristol said for her, considering not having children due to the climate crisis was ""such a hard subject to broach when most of your friends are having kids"".
""I don't want to bring new children into the world as it currently is. 
""I wouldn't feel okay making that choice.
""I'm going to hopefully go down the adoption route when I'm ready.
""Being able to talk about it at the workshop felt like a weight and been lifted.
""It's a very personal thing for me. For the first session I cried and I rarely cry. 
""A woman in front of me said she has kids and didn't know how she would look them in the eye in the future and have this conversation with them. 
""Hearing a mum say that was everything I've been scared of.
""Sharing these conversations has changed my life, it's made me sure in my decisions. I don't know how else I would have got to that point.""
'We shouldn't sacrifice our bodies'
Daniela Militaru, 37, from London said she felt embraced by the other women in the workshop.
""I didn't know it could be so liberating and so heart warming. I felt less alone,"" she said.
""It's a topic I do not discuss in my group of friends. Many of them are mothers and they understand, but they can go only as far as they can go. 
""My story came out in the workshop as a rant. Someone asked how many children is okay, some fire in me just came out.
""I don't think that women should should sacrifice their bodies and dreams for the climate crisis. It's something that we've been doing for centuries.
""One or two is fine, but having too many? Just because we can doesn't mean we should. 
""Maybe we should think about the consequences of our actions.
""I tried to talk with my mum but she only understood to a certain extent.""
Workshop facilitator and director Elizabeth Mytton said a lot of people had joined the project to find comfort about their climate crisis anxieties. 
""Actually hearing their stories and witnessing them together felt empowering. 
""We're very aware that it ended up being quite a homogenous group of white and largely middle-class women. 
""As a black women I thought there were lots of voices missing from this so we want to do more to ensure that a wider group of people can take part. 
""We see this as phase one of the project.""
Organisers are fundraising to start the next phase of the project that will continue to work with women across the UK to tell their stories.

health	RSV and flu: Parents 'panic' amid Canada shortage of children’s pain meds	"In early November, as temperatures in Toronto, Canada fell below freezing, Natalia Timofeeva's eight-year-old son, Alex, came down with a fever.
fever itself was pretty routine, said Ms Timofeeva, a 47-year-old single mother living in Canada's biggest city. But this time, when Alex's temperature climbed - reaching 40C (104F) - she ran out of medicine.
Ms Timofeeva went to a Shoppers Drug Mart - the largest pharmacy chain in the country - and found empty shelves. 
""They explained to me that the entire chain doesn't have Tylenol,"" she said. ""And they said don't even try other drugstores, because they all have the same supplier."" 
For months, Canada has faced a shortage of children's ibuprofen and acetaminophen (Advil and Tylenol), leaving parents desperate and without medication amid a nationwide surge of respiratory viruses. 
week, Canada's federal health agency said it had secured a foreign supply of children's acetaminophen to help curb demand. But the agency would not say when, exactly, these shipments will arrive or how much will be delivered, doing little to calm parents with the worst of flu season still to come. 
Observers say the intense demand for painkillers has been spurred by an unusual jump in viral infections among children - primarily coronavirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), all three of which produce fevers in young children.
""We're seeing this rapid rise in kids getting sick,"" said Kelly Grindrod, a licenced pharmacist and professor at the University of Waterloo. 
Part of the jump, Dr Grindrod said, is because Covid restrictions helped limit the spread of other viral illnesses, meaning a large cohort of children who have not been exposed before are getting sick all at once. 
""Respiratory virus season is challenging anyway, and now it seems to be even worse,"" she said. 
Parents have been left to scramble for the dwindling supply, relying on networks of friends and family to track down available medication before the shelves are cleared out. 
In recent weeks, Toronto Mommies, a parenting Facebook group with more than 23,000 members, has been dominated by pleas for the medication, as well as posts from anyone who has a ""sighting"" of one of the drugs. 
""There's panic, there's fear and there's worry,"" said Alisa Fulshtinsky, the group's founder. ""And parents don't know how long it's going to last."" 
For Ms Timofeeva, the hunt for medication involved a frenzied search of six drug stores over two days. 
""It was just helplessness,"" she said. ""And then your mind keeps looking: 'What else can I do?'""
She eventually found a specialised pharmacist who could compound the drugs and make her a generic version. 
Still, it's an expensive solution. Compounded products can cost C$60 to $100 ($45 to $75; £38 to £64) - compared to around C$10 for an average box - and typically expire within two weeks. 
medication shortage has also put added strain on an already overwhelmed children's health system. Emergency rooms and intensive care systems have been running over capacity for weeks, and wait times can reach 13 hours. 
At the largest paediatric hospital in the country, Toronto's SickKids, surgeries last week were limited to prioritise urgent procedures as its ICU ran at 127% capacity for several days in a row, with about half of intensive care patients on a ventilator.
""We are seeing an unprecedented stretch and pressure to the health system, especially in the paediatric realm,"" said Dr Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University Health Network in Toronto. 
rug shortage is making it worse, he said. 
""If you don't have the tools to care for your child at home... it might lead to a more ill child, and it might culminate in a visit to an emergency department."" 
rain is especially concerning given the time of year, he said. 
""Yes, we hear foreign shipments are coming, but today they're just not here,"" he said. ""What are people supposed to do today?"""	/news/world-us-canada-63656978

health	Ambulance strike: Yorkshire staff have 'had enough'	"Striking ambulance workers in Yorkshire say they have ""had enough"", with staff reporting being stuck in their vehicles for ""hours on end"" due to demand. 
Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) workers are among staff taking part in industrial action across England and Wales in a pay dispute. 
walkout only affects non life-threatening calls, unions said. 
One paramedic in Sheffield said: ""It has become stressful for a long time, but this is the pinnacle of it.""
In the Yorkshire and the Humber region, action by GMB union members started at 00:01 on Wednesday and is due to end at 00:01 on Thursday.
Unison members would take action for 12 hours from noon on Wednesday, YAS said. 
In Wakefield in West Yorkshire, paramedic Abigail Rowley, who has been in the job for 18 months, said she believed strike action was her only choice. 
""I think it's important that we are all together and supporting the NHS, we need to come together as one because it's underfunded and we're not going to patients,"" she said.
""We're stuck in the back of ambulances for hours on end and we just need to sort something out.""
Moments after the BBC spoke to Ms Rowley, she climbed into an ambulance to respond to a Category 1 life-threatening call.
Speaking to BBC Radio York, Bryn Webster, chair of Unison's National Ambulance Committee, said his members had been ""backed into a corner and we can't retain staff"".
""Ambulance crews are really finding it difficult, we have to remember that patients are waiting for hours and hours on a normal day and we have to highlight this,"" he said.
""We are wanting an above-inflation pay rise, but more importantly, we're after some proper funding and a look at how the ambulance service and NHS is funded.""
A spokesperson for YAS said during the action, which is part of a national pay dispute with the government, members of the public should only dial 999 for ""an ambulance for life-threatening conditions or injuries.""
Nick Smith, YAS director of operations said: ""All calls will be answered, but we'll prioritise calls and ensure we send to life-threatening or very serious cases.
""So unfortunately some patients in the lower categories of less acute incidents may get a delayed response.""
Mr Smith said he would advise patients with less acute issues to ""make their own way to emergency departments, or call their GP, NHS online or pharmacies.""
""We will still respond, we just may take longer getting there than we'd like to"", he added.
re are around 20 ambulance workers on the picket line in Wakefield, some in full uniform in case they are called away to deal with a life-threatening emergency. 
Here they are predominantly GMB members on a 24-hour walkout, but at other stations UNISON members are also on strike for 12 hours. 
Like nurses on Tuesday, these ambulance staff are angry at a below-inflation pay offer.  
government says it's fair and based on independent advice, but those here disagree sufficiently to walk off the job.  
YAS declared a critical incident on Tuesday, with more major disruption expected during the strike. 
re is a mixture of anger and frustration among those I've spoken to, with many saying the strike is a last resort but also their only option. 
At Longley Ambulance station in Sheffield, paramedic Simon Boulby said: ""It has become stressful for a long time, but this is the pinnacle of it, we've had enough.""
""It's the workload regarding the number of patients calling 999, our resources simply cannot cover that demand and the more we try it, the more we're putting people at risk.""
He added: ""I don't want to do this, I want to be looking after people who need us but we simply cannot safely go out and do the job we should be doing - it's simply not safe and there's a lot of people affected by it.""
In Northallerton, North Yorkshire, paramedic Scott Rutter, 34, said delays at hospitals meant they were unable to help as many people as they wished to.
""There's nowhere to put these patients. The nurses are short-staffed, so people are having seizures in corridors, people are having to use bedpans because they can't get to the toilet. It's absolutely ridiculous,"" he said.
""We might only do one or two jobs per shift because we're just stuck in the hospital."" 
A statement issued by YAS said union membership of both GMB and Unison was approximately 4,000 staff out of a workforce of over 7,000.  
Mr Webster, from Unison, added: ""Our call takers in our York and Wakefield Emergency Operations Centres are one of the most vital roles within our trust, they get take-home pay of about £1,400 a month and we can't retain them.
""Nearly half of them leave in their first year after training, so I don't want anyone to think that we are doing this lightly.
""Our members are responding to life critical calls, so I hope that's some solace to the public in Yorkshire.""
In East Yorkshire, Hull-based emergency care assistant Wendy Smith said: ""We've got long queues, hospital delays for getting beds, long working hours. Sometimes we can't get to the patients that we really need to get to and that's heartbreaking. 
""We have staff having to use food banks. They're that tired they can't mentally and physically do overtime.""
She asked for ""better pay, better conditions and better care for patients"".
Ms Smith, who is the Unison rep for Sutton Fields ambulance station, added: ""We can be queuing outside hospitals for eight or nine hours. When people are poorly, the last place you want to be is stuck in the back of the ambulance."" 
On Tuesday, YAS declared a critical incident as soaring demand saw people face ""significant delays"" waiting for ambulances.

health	Bristol student nurses say they worry about their future in the NHS	"Student nurses said they ""worry about their future in the NHS"" due to low pay, lack of support and understaffing.
Briony Davis is studying mental health nursing in Bristol and said she backed the upcoming strike over pay as she was struggling to afford her rent.
Walkouts have been announced by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England on 15 and 20 December.
government has previously announced average pay increases of 4.5% for doctors and 4.75% for other NHS staff.
Nurses are included in the 4.75% pay rise for other NHS workers in England next year.
Ms Davis said: ""I am struggling to afford rent this month, everyone is exhausted and this is the last hope.""
20-year-old is in her second year at the University of West of England (UWE).
She said she chose to go into nursing because she ""always felt a desire to care for people"", and when her mum was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she felt it was time to follow her dream.
""I don't think people understand the real pressures of the job,"" she said.
""Most of the nurses I have spoken to have been kicked, punched, racially abused and sexually assaulted.""
Ms Davis said she was struggling to afford rent because her full-time placement was unpaid.
""The voices of nurses have been ignored and overlooked for such a long time now,"" she added.
RCN union is  calling for nurses to be given a pay rise of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which was 14.2% in October.
Ms Davis lives with Lucy Farmer, 20, and Lizzie Haines, 23, who are also working in full-time, unpaid placements, alongside their studies at UWE.
Ms Farmer is also studying to be a mental health nurse, but with the cost of living crisis, she said she worried about her future in the NHS.
""For us there is no socialising, or doing anything that a typical student can do,"" she said.
""We can't afford to go out on nights out.""
She said the three of them had to ""get their pennies together"" just to afford a weekly shop.
""I even have to pay for petrol to get to my placement, which I don't always get reimbursed for.
""It is a real struggle, especially at the moment, we can't afford to put the heating on sometimes.""
Ms Haines is a second year student adult nurse.
""A lot of the girls (on the course) are single mums, it's a massive shame we have nursing students using foodbanks,"" she said.
""We don't get paid, not even for placements.
""The way things are now, I wouldn't leave nursing, but I would leave the NHS and go to another country where I might get treated better.
""It doesn't feel like we are valued here at the moment.""

health	China Covid: Unrest continues in Guangzhou as lockdown anger grows	"Watch: Riot police in hazmat suits clash with protesters in China.
People in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou have clashed with police overnight in the latest protest against the country's strict Covid rules.
Footage online showed police in white hazmat suits clutching riot shields to protect themselves from debris and glass thrown at them by protesters.
Another video showed people being taken away in handcuffs.
On Wednesday city officials said Covid restrictions would be relaxed in several districts.
China has seen record numbers of new cases in recent days.
According to posts on social media, the protests took place late on Tuesday and into the early hours of Wednesday in the district of Haizhu.
One Guangzhou resident told news agency AFP that he saw around 100 police officers converge on Houjiao village in Haizhu and arrest at least three men. 
Haizhu was also the scene of angry Covid protests earlier this month.
unrest follows a wave of protest in China over the weekend, triggered by a fire in a high-rise block in the western Xinjiang region that killed 10 people on Thursday. Many Chinese believe long-running Covid restrictions in the city contributed to the deaths, although the authorities deny this.
rompted people in Shanghai and Beijing and other big cities to take to the streets, demanding an end to strict Covid measures - with some also calling for President Xi Jinping to stand down. 
rotests later ebbed amid heavy a heavy police presence where demonstrations had taken place. 
untry's top security agency has since called for a crackdown on ""hostile forces"" and there have been reports of police contacting protesters, demanding information about where they had been. 
On Tuesday health officials were asked if there were any plans to relax Covid measures in light of the protests - one official said China would ""fine tune and modify"" measures to control the ""negative impact to people's livelihoods and lives"".
China remains the only major economy with a strict zero-Covid policy, with local authorities clamping down on even small outbreaks with mass testing, quarantines and snap lockdowns.
While China developed its own Covid vaccines, they are not as good as the mRNA technology - such as the Pfizer and Moderna shots - used elsewhere.

given to enough people. Far too few of the elderly - who are most likely to die from Covid - have been immunised.
re is also very little ""natural immunity"" from people surviving infections as a consequence of stopping the virus in its tracks.
It means new variants spread far more quickly than the virus that emerged three years ago and there is a constant risk of it being imported from countries that are letting the virus spread."	/news/world-asia-china-63805187
health	GMB union rejects improved NHS pay deal in Scotland	"GMB union has voted to reject an improved NHS pay deal from the Scottish government.
union represents NHS ambulance staff, nurses, porters and radiographers.
It said two thirds of its members voted to reject the improved offer, which would have seen workers receive an average 7.5% pay uplift.
GMB suspended a planned 26-hour ambulance strike last month and put the new offer to members in a vote.
GMB Scotland has more than 8,000 members employed across the NHS and its associated services, including 1,700 members in the Scottish Ambulance Service. 
Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) voted to accept the offer on Thursday.
Members of Unite and Unison also voted to accept the offer earlier this week.
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members are currently voting on the offer.
GMB Scotland senior organiser for public service Keir Greenaway said the government's pay offer ""doesn't go far enough"" to help staff struggling with the cost of living crisis, or to improve the understaffing crisis affecting frontline services.
Mr Greenaway said the union wanted to get back round the table with Health Secretary Humza Yousaf before Christmas.
He said: ""It is important the cabinet secretary takes on board the views of all NHS staff and not just some, because we are talking about frontline workers who understand first-hand the crisis across service delivery and patient care, and they have clear and credible views on how these services can be recovered in the months and years ahead.
""The fact remains that GMB members in major services and health board areas have strong legal mandates for strikes and an imposition of this offer without further discussion would be seriously detrimental to the industrial relations the Scottish government have been quick to promote.
""If the cabinet secretary wants to preserve those relations, he must meet our members urgently.""
After the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy accepted the pay offer, senior negotiating officer in Scotland Claire Ronald said ""there is far more to do on pay"" for all workers.
She added: ""However, while not everything we would have wanted, and not everything members deserve, this offer does represent a good step forward.""
Mr Yousaf previously told BBC Scotland that the government's latest £515m pay proposal had been its ""best and final"" offer and there was ""nothing left in the coffers"" to improve it.
retary said NHS strikes would be ""catastrophic"" in an already overstretched service.
Nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are currently striking in the largest action of its kind in NHS history.
Staff will continue to provide ""life-preserving"" and some urgent care but routine surgery and other planned treatment is likely to be disrupted.
Strike plans in Scotland were put on pause when the Scottish government tabled its improved pay deal.
RCN's ballot of its members in Scotland closes on Monday, but it is not clear when the result will be announced. 
union did not make a recommendation on how members should vote, but it said the new deal ""still does not meet our members' expectations"" and that there would be a ""clear mandate for strike action"" if the offer was rejected. 
It had asked for a pay deal at least 5% above inflation, which reached 10.7% in November.
GMB members to reject the current pay offer shows that the risk of industrial action in the NHS in Scotland remains real.
union has still to decide on its next steps and hopes strike action will not be necessary.
But, aside from the question of cost, will it be possible to make a meaningful improvement to a pay offer? The offer which has now been accepted by Unison - which is the biggest union within the NHS in Scotland - and Unite?
xt big question is whether members of the Royal College of Nursing will accept the offer.
RCN has spoken favourably about the Scottish government's efforts to engage with the NHS unions.
But that certainly does not mean that any presumptions can be made about whether RCN members will accept or reject the offer.
Any strike action requires two weeks notice which, realistically, means there is no possibility of it taking place before the new year."	/news/uk-scotland-63986827
health	Salford Royal Hospital's emergency care criticised by inspectors	"A hospital that was lauded by ministers as a beacon of good practice has been told it ""requires improvement"" by the health watchdog. 
Care Quality Commission (CQC) rated Salford Royal's urgent and emergency services inadequate for safety after an inspection in August and September.

Northern Care Alliance (NCA) NHS Trust said it accepted the recommendations.
It also runs three other hospitals across Greater Manchester, including Fairfield General Hospital in Bury, Rochdale Infirmary and Royal Oldham Hospital.
Other issues highlighted included staff shortages, training, governance and some care concerns. 
Salford Royal merged with Pennine Acute Hospitals Trust (PAHT) in 2016 to form the NCA. 
NCA had not had a full CQC inspection since its creation, but its ""outstanding"" rating was derived from Salford's last ""outstanding"" rating in 2018, and the ""good"" rating for PAHT in 2020.
In its latest report, the CQC found staff ""working incredibly hard under pressure"".
But leaders did not ""operate effective governance"" and some staff expressed reservations about raising concerns.

watchdog rated the trust as ""requires improvement"" overall, and for being safe, effective, responsive and well-led. 
It was rated ""good"" for being caring.
Head of hospital inspection Karen Knapton said new leaders had already started to make improvements but they ""weren't fully embedded"".
""We found staff working incredibly hard under pressure to deliver the best possible care to patients"", she said.
Inspectors did find some evidence of outstanding practice, including support for victims of domestic abuse at Royal Oldham and a staff-led initiative to build a garden at the Fairfield site.
But leaders did not always ""actively and openly engage with patients and staff to plan and manage services"" and complaints and incident investigations sometimes took too long.
Inspectors also found ""differences in policies and clinical practice which did not reflect best-practice"" and that ""leaders did not operate consistent, effective governance processes throughout the service"".
Staff did not always feel respected, supported and valued, though they remained focused on the needs of patients, they added.
Dr Owen Williams, NCA chief executive, said: ""We fully accept the CQC's judgement and their recommended areas for improvement.""
He said he recognised that improvements already being made ""do not go far enough at this moment in time"" and said staff were ""determined to work together to get better results for the people we serve"".
Dr Williams thanked ""totally caring"" colleagues who are working ""incredibly hard"" at ""a time of unprecedented demand"" under ""a level of pressure the likes of which many of us have not experienced before"".

health	Derbyshire NHS demand set to continue in New Year	"Derbyshire's health and social care system is under ""sustained and significant pressure"", NHS bosses have said.
NHS said high demand at hospitals across Christmas was likely to continue into the New Year period.
111 call centre at Pride Park has also seen high demand, with tens of thousands of calls since Christmas Eve. 
People are being asked to think about alternatives to emergency departments for treating coughs and colds.
Dr Chris Weiner, executive medical director for NHS Derby and Derbyshire, said: ""The Christmas bank holiday period saw significant pressure across the Derbyshire health and care system. 
""We are open for business and our services are there for anyone who needs them but we are prioritising patients with the highest level of need, particularly those requiring urgent and emergency care. 
""There are things everyone can do to help and we are asking people to use our services wisely and to think about self-care as an option for some conditions, such as coughs and colds, before automatically going to the NHS for help.""
He added that as well as self-care, pharmacies, urgent treatment centres and the NHS 111 services were available online or by phone.
Some smaller urgent care walk-in centres, such as Swadlincote, also have limits on capacity.
Mr Weiner also called on the public to treat health staff with respect, even if they are facing delays in treatment.

health	Thousands more cancer cases linked to deprivation	"usands of extra cancer cases are linked to deprivation in Scotland, according to Cancer Research UK (CRUK).
rity has found that around 4,900 extra cancer cases a year are linked, which equates to 13 cases a day.
g in the poorest areas are also more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage when cancer can be harder to treat successfully.   
Smoking is the biggest cause of cancer in Scotland and it continues to be far more common in deprived communities. 
Nearly 7% of cancer cases each year in Scotland are caused by excess weight, making it the second biggest risk factor and those living in deprived areas are also more likely to be overweight or obese.
A report by CRUK found cancer death rates are 74% higher in the most deprived communities than the least deprived in Scotland.
f executive of Cancer Research UK, Michelle Mitchell, said it was ""unacceptable"" that people from deprived areas were more likely to die from cancer.
She said: ""The Scottish government's forthcoming cancer strategy is a key opportunity to tackle cancer inequalities.  
""People in Scotland need the strategy to be bold, ambitious and fully funded so no-one with cancer is disadvantaged because of where they live or due to financial pressures. 
""Now is the time to go further and faster to ensure that beating cancer means beating cancer for everyone.""  
CRUK researchers found that screening uptake is also far lower in more deprived communities.
Bowel cancer screening is 38% lower and breast cancer screening is 32% lower compared to in the least deprived areas.
Access to cancer treatment can also vary depending on where people live and receiving treatment can be more challenging for people living in rural areas. 
Melanie Finlay is currently receiving chemotherapy treatment at Raigmore hospital in Inverness.
She lives in the city with her husband and eight-year-old son Joseph but she has faced several 200-mile round trips from Inverness to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for appointments.  
She said: ""It was a long journey, travelling to Aberdeen to be seen by a doctor, and we had to arrange for someone to pick Joseph up after school while we were away.    
""I've also met people who live in the countryside and have faced long, difficult journeys to access treatment.""
Melanie was an admin officer for Police Scotland when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2018. 
Having had surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she hoped to put the disease behind her. But when she experienced joint pains, she tried to get a GP appointment in December 2020. 
Due to the pandemic, she faced a two-month wait and after seeing a physiotherapist, she was finally diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in March 2021, that had spread to her bones and was stage four. 
She said: ""Cancer affects all of us, it doesn't discriminate.  
""It is unfair if people living in one area or community in Scotland have less chance of surviving cancer because of who they are, where they live or barriers they face while trying to get treatment.""
In its report, CRUK has laid out three key actions to tackle cancer inequalities.
ude tackling the known drivers of cancer inequality, such as providing more support to reduce smoking and obesity in deprived communities. 
rity also wants to diagnose cancers earlier by enabling people to get timely access to health services, including screening. 
Collecting routine data on patient characteristics would also help strengthen infrastructure, the charity believes, and build a stronger understanding of where inequalities exist.
 The Scottish government launched a written consultation on a new cancer strategy between April and June 2022, which sought views on which areas to prioritise in relation to cancer prevention, management and care.
responses will be used to inform the drafting of the new 10-year cancer strategy and three year action plan to be published in the spring of 2023.
re are multiple reasons why people in the poorest communities are more likely to get cancer and to have it diagnosed late.
Some of it is linked to lifestyle, with higher rates of smoking and obesity; but it also comes down to things like having to choose between going to work or going to the GP, or the cost of taking two buses to a hospital appointment.
rrents are well-known and are considered unfair and avoidable. The call from charities like Cancer Research UK is that to fix it greater investment is needed - not simply in staff or diagnostic equipment that will improve outcomes for everyone - but in targeted efforts to reduce rates of smoking, still far higher in deprived communities, or making it much easier to access treatment.
But almost a quarter of those referred after a suspicion of cancer waited longer than the 62 day target to start treatment and there are backlogs in screening because of the pandemic.

One of those, Geraint Edwards, 26, took his life during the Covid pandemic in June 2020 after ""hiding his feelings"", his mother Joanne Hedges said.
He died months after his grandfather also killed himself, and she said her pain goes on every day.
She hopes her son's story can make a difference to others who are struggling.
Abercrave rugby club, near Ystradgynlais in Powys, has trained a player in mental health issues in the hope it will encourage men to speak out.
Ms Hedges said: ""Geraint was one of a kind, he'd help anyone and could be bubbly, but could get down and he always had his struggles, but he couldn't talk about his own feelings.""
Geraint was a keen sportsman, a good footballer and rugby player, who previously worked with the charity Street Football Wales, she said. 
""He fitted so much into his short life,"" she said.
Ms Hedges felt her son struggled during the pandemic and lockdowns, and he was very close to his grandfather Dennis, 80.
Following her father's death, Geraint called her every day to check she was OK.
""They were two peas in a pod,"" said Ms Hedges.
""They had a really strong bond and when my dad died, Geraint did really struggle. He missed him. But Geraint would ring me every day because I was close to my dad, and I was really upset and traumatised by it.""
She added: ""So, he'd ring and say, 'Mam, you OK? You're not going to do anything silly now', but all along he was hiding his own feelings.""
Ms Hedges is now training as a nurse and said it had been a big help to focus on a new career and helping people.
She said: ""Geraint couldn't deal with it any more, instead of just turning and talking, suicide was his way out. 
""He just wanted the pain to stop. But our pain goes on every day.""
Ystradgynlais Mind started a campaign called Frame of Mind, backed by actor Michael Sheen, which trains people to be mental health first-aiders in areas where men traditionally do not talk about their mental health.
Gareth Brookes, who plays for two rugby teams in the area, Abercrave RFC and Yogits Vets Touch Rugby, trained as a mental health first-aider after Geraint's death.
""At Abercrave, we lost two people in the second team to suicide during the pandemic, including Geraint,"" he said.
""We had no-one acting as a mental health first-aider. I was happy to take on that role. I'm not a counsellor, but I put myself out there for any of the boys that need to talk. 
""Since then, seven of them have been in touch to say they were struggling, some with depression and anxiety, some with PTSD. I've been able to signpost them towards getting help. I also intervened when someone was considering suicide.""
Mr Brookes said he wanted to normalise speaking about mental health.
""I've experienced anxiety and depression myself. I've had a number of rounds of counselling and self-help courses, which I feel gives me the empathy to understand what the boys are going through,"" he said.
""I've learned from my own experiences that talking really does help and that's the message I get through to the boys to talk before things spiral out of control.""
Donna James, the lead on the campaign for Mind Ystradgynlais, said: ""There is a cultural stigma. 
""There has long been this stiff upper lip mentality and men shouldn't cry which is seen as strength, but it is a weakness because it's making them ill. By not saying 'I'm not ok' is killing them.
""Seventy-five percent of people who died from suicide were not known to groups like us or their GPs. 
""That's why mental health first-aider model is so important because it's giving them that person to go to, who they feel more comfortable to talk to. I think this campaign has saved lives and will save more.""

health	Coleshill mum raising awareness of rare heart condition	"A woman who nearly died from a rare heart condition says she wants to raise awareness of it among both parents and medics.
Paige Wilson, from Coleshill, Warwickshire, gave birth to Ollie in 2019 but fell ill four days later. 
At first diagnosed with sepsis, doctors also found she had peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) and at one stage called her family to say goodbye.
""I couldn't breathe and I did think I was going to die,"" Ms Wilson said.
mptoms came on days after her healthy pregnancy and birth at the George Eliot Hospital, Nuneaton.
""I started to feel really unwell. I just felt like I couldn't get out of bed, there was something that wasn't quite right,"" she said.
PPCM is a condition which leads to changes in the heart that can cause it to become enlarged and can lead to heart failure.
Cardiomyopathy UK said it occurred in the last part of pregnancy or the first few months after.
In the most severe cases, it can be fatal or require a heart transplant.
Ms Wilson made a full recovery, but said she felt guilty about missing the first few weeks of her son's life.
""I felt like I didn't bond with Ollie, because I felt like this awful mum because I'd missed practically his first couple of weeks,"" she said.
Her family, the NHS, support groups and her son all helped in her recovery, she added.
NHS said more was being done to help staff spot the signs of PPCM and other rare maternity conditions.
Raising awareness of the issues is key as they may not appear frequently, said Dr Dawn Adamson, consultant cardiologist at University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire.
""We're doing a lot of work to train the future generations who are looking after the maternity services - the obstetricians, the cardiologists, GPs, primary care - to try and be aware of all these different conditions,"" she said.

health	Covid-19: PM Modi cautions India amid China coronavirus surge	"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged people to start wearing masks again as the country steps up surveillance of Covid cases.
Mr Modi held a review meeting on Thursday amid a surge in cases in China which has put India on alert.
rime minister called for increased testing and encouraged a return to Covid-appropriate behaviour. 
India had relaxed its Covid rules, including mask-wearing, earlier this year after a drop in infection levels.
untry witnessed two deadly waves in 2020 and 2022 - and the government had come under heavy criticism for its handling of the second wave in the summer of 2021 when thousands died amid a lack of oxygen supplies and critical medicines.
At Thursday's meeting, Mr Modi asked states to ensure operational readiness of hospital infrastructure, including a healthy supply of oxygen cylinders and ventilators.
While there was no reason to panic, the prime minister cautioned against complacency and urged citizens to take all necessary precautions. 
According to government data, India currently has only around 3,400 active coronavirus cases, but reports of the surge in China have created a sense of fear among many people. 
Over the past few months, India has reported four Covid-19 cases caused by BF.7, the Omicron subvariant linked to a spike in cases in China. 
- three in Gujarat state and one in Odisha - were detected in July, September and November and the patients have recovered, health officials have said.
Several experts have said that India does not have reason to panic.
In Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has assured the people that no case of the Covid variant has been detected in national capital.
In the southern state of Karnataka, the government has made Covid tests mandatory for flu-like symptoms and said masks may soon be mandatory in closed spaces.
fficials have asked people to get vaccinated and take booster doses. Over 2.2 billion Covid vaccine doses have been administered so far in the country, but only 27% of the population have taken the booster dose - which India calls a ""precaution dose"" - so far. 
government said it had no plans yet to stop flights from countries where new cases were reported. But the country has resumed random testing of international travellers at the airports.
On Thursday, India's health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said in parliament that though cases in China were rising, those in India were ""depleting"". He added that the ministry was closely monitoring new variants and advised states to increase genome sequencing.
On Twitter, the government also debunked a fake message circulating on WhatsApp regarding a subvariant of the Omicron strain.
Earlier this week, the federal government asked states to send samples of all Covid positive patients to labs runs by a health ministry forum which monitors various strains of Covid in India.
Mr Mandaviya also asked states to encourage people to follow social distancing and other rules during the upcoming festive season. Chief ministers of several states have been reviewing their preparedness to deal with infections if needed. "	/news/world-asia-india-64073259
health	Who is striking? How Thursday 15 December’s walkouts will affect you	"Christmas may be very close but when it comes to strikes good tidings are in short supply.
On Thursday nurses will walk out in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The advice is this: if you haven't heard your appointment is cancelled, assume it's going ahead. There's no need to call your local hospital to check.
Rail workers are not striking today but check before you travel. Disruption from Wednesday's strikes mean services will start later and, in some places, finish earlier.
my latest strike briefing, with lots of useful information on what is happening - and how it might affect you.
Across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, nurses from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) union are walking out.
rike will involve staff in about a quarter of hospitals and community teams in England, all health boards in Northern Ireland and all but one in Wales (the Aneurin Bevan in south-east Wales).
Under trade union laws, life-preserving care has to be provided - so all nursing staff are expected to work in services such as intensive and emergency care.
But the action will affect routine services, such as planned operations like knee and hip replacements, district nursing - and mental health care.
Each hospital trust has been negotiating with local union representatives about what care should be provided - so the level of care will vary.
RCN is calling for nurses to be given a pay rise that's 5% above the Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation rate, against which salary increases are often judged.
NHS staff in England and Wales, including nurses, have been awarded an average increase of 4.75%.
In Northern Ireland, NHS staff are to get a similar increase - backdated to April. Health sector workers in NI - members of Unison, Nipsa and GMB - have already been striking this week over pay and conditions. In Scotland, RCN members are not striking on Thursday. They are considering an updated pay offer from the Scottish government - an average 7.5% increase - which has already been accepted by members of the Unite and Unison unions.
Watch Make Sense of Strikes on iPlayer and find out more about why people are striking and whether industrial action works.
48-hour strike at the Royal Mail continues until 23:59 on Thursday. 
On strike days there will be no first or second class letter deliveries - and no collections from post boxes. 
If this all sounds like Groundhog Day, you are not wrong. Take a look at my briefing on Wednesday for Royal Mail's advice to customers.
walkout by members of the UK's biggest rail union RMT ends at 23:59 on Wednesday. 
But remember on Friday, the disruption starts all over again. The RMT is due to walk out for another 48 hours until the end of Saturday. 
Further RMT strikes are also planned over the Christmas and New Year period.
We will have another briefing for you from teatime on Thursday - looking ahead to Friday's disruption when rail workers will walk out again.
Check out our full rundown of all the December and January strikes.

health	Hospitals introduce new time limits to help emergency departments	"Northern Ireland's health trusts have agreed new target times for discharging patients and for ambulance handovers to ease pressure on emergency departments.
Patients medically fit for discharge will leave hospital within 48 hours if they have a suitable place to go to.
uld be an ""alternative interim placement"" while they wait for a space in their first choice of care home.
For ambulances, a three-hour limit to handover patients to EDs will apply to free staff for life-threatening calls.
Under the new plans if there is no available bed at the ED, ambulance crews will be asked to place their patients in corridors instead. 
If hospital inpatients are medically fit and are waiting to be discharged, they may be asked to use chairs rather than beds ""where appropriate,"" according to a joint statement from the trusts' chief executives.
r families will be asked to take them home if they can, or agree to admit them to the first suitable care home if they cannot go home.
""These are not steps that we ever wanted or indeed imagined having to introduce,"" the statement said. 
""They are not designed as a long-term solution, but as actions to reduce the risk to patients waiting in unacceptable circumstances in ambulances and emergency departments.""
It follows weeks of intensive pressure on hospitals across Northern Ireland, which are struggling to admit new patients because most beds are already occupied.
On Monday morning, there was a record 380 people waiting to be admitted across Northern Ireland's EDs and 360 of those had been waiting more than 12 hours. 
In one case, an elderly person was brought by ambulance to an ED at 08:20 GMT.  The patient was still in the ambulance at 16:15 GMT.
At 16:00 GMT on Sunday, 13 ambulances were waiting outside the Ulster Hospital ED. 
Often, hospitals are caring for patients who are well enough to leave, but who need additional support in order to live in the community.
Some of those patients stay in hospital because there is no-one to look after them on discharge or they cannot secure accommodation in their preferred care setting.
On Friday, 158 patients were fit to be discharged in the Belfast Health Trust, but because a majority of them turned down a temporary placement in a nursing home, they remained as inpatients. 
f executive of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) said the system was under probably the greatest pressure it had ever been.
Michael Bloomfield said health workers would be expecting patients and their family members to cooperate with staff to free up hospital beds for the patients who needed them most. 
""We particularly need them to work with us around taking family members home, or discharging them into appropriate care homes when they become medically fit, when their care and their treatment in hospital is over,"" Mr Bloomfield said.
He added it was not in patients' best interests to remain in hospital longer than necessary and that staff would work ""sensibly"" with families to discharge patients into care facilities that would meet their needs.
NIAS chief said the patients who currently faced the ""greatest risk"" were those who were ill and waiting on ambulances to arrive and those who were waiting ""far too long"" in the backs of ambulances for admission to EDs.
As the ED crisis has been in the headlines for months there will be some who will question the timing of this announcement, particularly just days before Christmas. 
-called winter pressures began in the summer this year and have been building ever since.  
Some of those who work in the system have said it is all too little, too late. 
Discharging patients from hospital and placing them in nursing homes has not worked to date.  
Using a firmer tone when asking families to cooperate is unlikely to work. 
But health leaders have admitted these are not steps they ever imagined introducing and instead what is required is long-term funding and a system that is capable of meeting rising levels of demand.
f executives' joint statement said that they were deeply distressed at the ongoing situation in local hospitals.
xpected the current pressures to intensify after Christmas and into the early months of next year.
""Although strenuous efforts are being made to alleviate the pressures, we have a serious capacity deficit which means too many people are waiting too long for care,"" they said.
""Much of the impact of this is falling on frail and ill older people and on the staff caring for them.""
""cannot passively accept the status quo, with all that it means for patient care and safety"". 
RCN's Rita Devlin describes ""mayhem"" in the emergency department at the Royal Victoria Hospital last week
In relation to the 48-hour patient discharge target, they said there would be no ""cost to the patient or their family for this alternative interim placement and it will not impact on their place on any waiting list for their longer term option"". 
rusts and care homes will work closely together to make best use of any and all available capacity. 
""This will include new shared arrangements for pre-admission assessment for care homes seven days a week,"" the chief executives said.
Other departments in hospitals will be asked to make ""maximum use"" of available space in wards ""to improve patient flow out of overcrowded emergency departments"". "	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64031282
health	Linden Centre: Alarm 'possibly would' prevent patient's absconding	"A 23-year-old man may have been prevented from fleeing a mental health unit if all staff were wearing their security alarms, an inquest heard.
Jayden Booroff was found dead after absconding from the Linden Centre in Chelmsford, Essex, on 23 October 2020.
A coroner heard a nurse tried to ""grab"" Mr Booroff as he fled, but was not carrying her alarm to alert colleagues.
Doreen Mhone, the matron at the time, said the alarm ""possibly would have"" prevented the incident.
Ms Mhone, who was overseeing three acute wards and is now a service manager, said staff are told to bring their Pinpoint alarms to each shift.
Mr Booroff, described as a talented musician, was sectioned in October 2020 and taken to the Linden Centre, run by the Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust.
quest was told he had a history of undiagnosed mental health issues, and had previously been treated at The Lakes in Colchester.
He went missing at about 19:45 BST and his body was found near Chelmsford railway station about two hours later.
Jurors also heard staff were reminded in 2017 to ensure doors were closed behind them after an inpatient ""tailgated"" a nurse out of the building.
Area coroner Sonia Hayes asked Ms Mhone why a similar incident happened nine days later.
Ms Mhone admitted staff were likely to have been unaware of the new guidance, but added: ""We would look at the incident not as an isolated incident, and try to ascertain where it went wrong, have a discussion with the team basically, on what they've learnt from that incident.""
Mr Booroff's keyworker on the ward admitted she went on annual leave on 22 October having not completed his care plan.
She told jurors Mr Booroff did not engage with her, adding: ""When I came back to work on the Wednesday [the following week] I had paperwork ready to sit with Jayden because I really believed that after the weekend and a few days of rest he might have been able to engage better with myself.
""I had the kind of view that he was into music and arts, so I really wanted to sit with him and see where he wanted to go following admission.""
urt heard the junior nurse had not read all of Mr Booroff's previous care notes, which were more than 70 pages long and included suicidal thoughts, and had not updated his risk assessment.
""You can navigate through the system and look at different case notes and histories, but it is not a simple task of clicking and showing all [the records] rolling one after another,"" she said.
wo-week inquest at Essex Coroner's Court is due to conclude on Friday.

health	Strep A: Parents say son misdiagnosed before death	"family of a boy who died of an invasive form of strep A have said they sought medical help three times before he was admitted to hospital.
Jax Albert Jefferys, who attended Morelands Primary School in Waterlooville, Hampshire, died on 1 December, aged five. 
His family said they were initially told he had flu.
Since September, UK Health Security Agency figures show 15 UK children have died after invasive strep A infections.
Paying tribute to their ""darling son"", Jax's family said they had sought medical advice on three occasions during the four days leading up to his death and were told that he was suffering with influenza A.
""We then followed the recommended course of action: to administer a proprietary paracetamol-based medication in the prescribed dosage,"" they said in a statement. 
However, they said on the fourth day Jax's condition ""deteriorated so much"" they ""rushed him to hospital"" and he later died. 
""Only after his death was it confirmed that the cause was [strep A],"" the family said. 
""We would dearly like to express our deepest thanks to all the hospital staff who did their utmost to save Jax.
""We sincerely ask that people respect our privacy at this time."" 
Earlier this month, Alison Syred-Paul, head teacher at Morelands Primary School, urged parents to know the signs of the strep A bacterial infection. 
According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) the infection usually causes a sore throat, scarlet fever or skin rash and is passed by physical contact or through droplets from sneezing or coughing.
But in ""very rare occasions"" the bacteria causing scarlet fever could get into the bloodstream and cause an illness which can be ""very serious"", UKHSA warns. 
According to the World Health Organization, influenza A is one of four types of seasonal influenza viruses.

health	Flax Medical Centre: Ardoyne GP practice saved as new contractor found	"A GP practice in north Belfast has been saved from closure after new management was found to operate it, the Department of Health (DoH) said.
Flax Medical Centre, in Ardoyne, needed new managers after its operator returned their contract to the department. 
Oldpark Group Practice has been named as the new operator from 1 January.
Both practices will relocate to a new purpose-built premises at the Everton Centre from 16 January.
It will be renamed Eden Park Medical Practice, and all patients will be automatically registered with the new service.
will also receive a letter in the next few days confirming their new GP practice.
Previously, Ardoyne residents were worried the centre's 3,000 patients would be at risk if a new contractor was not found by the end of December.
Figures from the Department of Health show the number of GP practices in Northern Ireland has fallen by just under 9% in eight years.
But, despite the decrease in practices, the number of GPs, excluding locums, has gone up by 20% to 1,419 since 2014."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64005925
health	Scarborough: Ambulances queue at hospital due to A&E pressures	"Paramedics are waiting ""for several hours"" to drop patients off at an A&E department, a union member has said.
Video filmed by Deanne Ferguson, from the GMB Union, showed a line of ambulances outside Scarborough Hospital on Monday evening.
She claimed nurses were treating patients in the back of ambulances.
Yorkshire Ambulance Service said there were handover delays at hospitals while the hospital trust said it was under ""extreme pressure"".
At one point 14 ambulances were queueing up to drop patients off at the A&E department, Ms Ferguson said.
rgets for hospital trusts state handovers should take place within 60 minutes, with 95% taking place within 30 minutes, and 65% taking place within 15 minutes.
""We saw paramedics who had responded to 999 calls several hours ago still waiting to drop patients off inside the A&E,"" Ms Ferguson said.
Nurses were seeing people in the back of the vehicles to decide who should be prioritised, it was claimed.
""It was something we've never seen before, but, apparently, this is the norm,"" she added.
York and Scarborough Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said the ""extreme pressure"" at the hospitals was having an impact at A&E.
""High numbers of patients waiting to be discharged who no longer need to be in hospital results in patients waiting longer for beds to become available,"" a spokesperson said.
Assessments by nurses in the back of ambulances was done to ""maximise patient safety"", with the sickest patients being prioritised, the spokesperson added.
Nick Smith, Executive Director of Operations at Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said staff were working with partners to address the issue with slower-than-expected handovers at busy hospitals.

health	Pat Cullen: Who is the RCN nursing union boss leading strikes?	"It may be surprising to hear Pat Cullen struck a tone of sorrow, not anger, as she led English and Welsh nurses into the first nationwide strike in the nursing union's 106-year history.
Speaking on the first day of the walkouts, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing called it ""a tragic day for nursing, and a tragic day for patients"".
union chief's sombre approach appears to have resonated somewhat with the public. While many feared for patients as the NHS weathered two days without nurses delivering any non-emergency care, two-thirds of people say they support the profession's campaign for better pay and working conditions, according to the latest YouGov poll this week.
As the top official for the RCN, Ms Cullen represents over 465,000 registered nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and nursing students. Around 300,000 of these are nurses, representing two-thirds of the profession.
At a time of deep crisis for the NHS, she is tasked with fighting for the welfare and rights of staff while also keeping in check with the frustrations of patients facing spiralling waiting lists, treatment delays and a shortage of resources.
But Ms Cullen, as she has described herself, is tenacious. She successfully spearheaded strike action in her home nation of Northern Ireland in 2019 to get better pay for nurses. That too was Northern Ireland's first ever nationwide nursing strike. 
Ms Cullen, a former psychiatric nurse turned RCN general secretary, has previously said nursing was ""in her blood"". 
58-year-old grew up in Carrickmore in County Tyrone, born to farmer Paddy McAleer and his wife, Annie. She was the youngest of seven siblings, with six sisters and one brother. 
Ms Cullen says she was inspired into the profession by her eldest sister, who would come home in a ""beautiful uniform"", talking passionately about her last shift.
""I remember thinking, even at that young age, it was just incredible how much she was able to touch people's lives,"" she told the Guardian earlier this month.
Ms Cullen did not pass her GCSEs so did not stay on for A-Levels and instead decided on nursing college in Carrickmore, a time she recalled to the Belfast Telegraph as her ""really happy years"".  
RCN chief was drawn to mental health nursing in particular after watching her mother take care of one of her sisters, who has learning disabilities. 
Working as a community psychiatric nurse during the height of the Troubles, Ms Cullen recalled the impact of the violence on mental health being ""shocking"".
It was during her time as an 18-year-old trainee in County Antrim that she started calling out what she saw as injustices in the system.
She wrote to hospital management over a ""heartless policy"" which punished patients whose behaviour proved difficult by taking away their personal possessions like sweets or cigarettes.
""I just felt that was such an injustice. Patients on the wards couldn't cope without their own personal belongings,"" she told the Guardian. ""I think I did win it; I felt great about it."" 
Royal College of Nursing leader Pat Cullen: ""My door is open""
Following her work on the front line, Ms Cullen worked as the professional head of nursing in a local healthcare trust, before joining the Department of Health as a nursing officer in 2001. 
Her husband of 30 years - Enda - also works in healthcare as a GP in south Belfast. Despite her best efforts, her two children are not in the nursing profession, but her son Shane is training to be a surgeon in Dublin.
It was in 2019, the year she was appointed the Royal College of Nursing's Northern Ireland director, that she was confronted with what she described as ""an injustice too far"".
Nurses' pay in Northern Ireland had fallen to 10 years behind anywhere else in the UK, compelling her to campaign for strike action, the first in the union's history.
A three-day strike led to Stormont striking a deal with the RCN, leading to the introduction of better pay, and legislation on safe staffing levels.
Now, Ms Cullen is leading a similar battle for nurses in England and Wales. She was appointed the RCN's interim general secretary and chief executive in July 2021, initially for a period of 18 months.
While the RCN and the government have held talks, Ms Cullen has insisted that everything has been on the table - apart from discussions on pay.
In the face of the strikes, Health Secretary Steve Barclay has said that the RCN's requests for a 19% pay rise was ""unaffordable"" during a cost-of-living crisis, but has said his door is ""always open"" to continue talks. He emphasised the pay offer was based it on recommendations by an independent pay review body.
With the union and the government in a stalemate, Ms Cullen has warned that there may be further action to come in 2023.
And in her own words, she describes herself as someone who will follow through on something she believes in ""to the bitter end"". 
""I'm hardworking,"" she told the Guardian. ""I have a really wicked sense of humour. That gets me through. And I'm tenacious. I'm definitely tenacious. When I believe in something I'll follow it through to the bitter end, I absolutely will."""	/news/uk-64065830
health	Nurses' strikes: Union warns of more action unless pay talks open	"Royal College of Nursing could announce a fresh wave of strikes if Health Secretary Steve Barclay does not agree to reopen pay negotiations. 
Speaking on the BBC's Question Time, the union's leader Pat Cullen said if the government continued to refuse to ""get in a room and talk"" then the dispute could escalate in the new year. 
UK government says the union's demands are unaffordable.
Nurses are already planning to strike on Tuesday. 
f thousands of nurses took industrial action across England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Thursday, with tens of thousands of patient appointments cancelled or postponed.
Union sources have told the BBC that if there is no move to reopen pay talks, then new strike dates will be announced before Christmas with a series of walkouts likely in January. 
f disruption could also increase, with nurses striking across more NHS trusts in England and for longer periods of time - perhaps over two consecutive days. Industrial action is also taking place in Wales and Northern Ireland. 
NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, has urged ministers to act to avoid strikes in the new year which it said could be ""more severe"" and coordinated with other health unions. 
government said the nurses' demands for a 19% pay rise are unaffordable and it has followed the recommendation of an independent pay review body in setting wages.
Nurses got an extra 3% last year after the pandemic and another rise recommended by a pay review body.
Speaking outside a hospital in London on Thursday, the UK health secretary said the government was ""hugely grateful"" to nurses but the 19% pay rise they wanted was ""not affordable given the many other economic pressures that we face"".
Mr Barclay said three-quarters of trusts had not gone on strike that day and many nurses had continued working in areas excluded from the strike because of the risk to life.
Under strike rules, emergency care must still be provided during action, for example in intensive care and A&E, and urgent cancer treatment and dialysis should run as normal - which means the biggest impact will have been on routine services. These include planned knee and hip replacements and out-patient appointments.
Rebecca, a nurse striking outside St Thomas' Hospital in London on Thursday, said her job was ""too tiring, it's too much, it's just not safe for either the staff or the patients to continue the way it is now"".
Under-staffing was a major concern for Kelly Hopkins, who has been a nurse for 25 years in Liverpool, as well as the financial struggles of her colleagues.
""They're having to use food banks, they're coming in cold, they're going without food to feed their children, it's just crazy,"" she said.
Watch this video quiz to test your knowledge of nurses' pay
In England and Wales, most NHS staff have received a pay rise of roughly £1,400 this year - worth about 4% on average for nurses.
uation in Northern Ireland meant there was a delay in processing the increase - but nurses should receive backdated payments before the end of the financial year.
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) wants a larger rise, of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which currently stands at 14%, saying its members have received years of below-inflation pay increases.
government says it has followed the recommendation of the independent NHS Pay Review Body, which said in July NHS staff should receive the £1,400 increase, with slightly more for the most experienced nurses.
RCN has criticised this body for not being independent enough. It is made up mainly of economists and human resources professionals.
Welsh ministers said they were unable to enter pay talks without extra funding from the UK government.
In Scotland, the RCN's strike action was ""paused"" after ministers made a fresh offer worth just over £2,200, or 7.5%, a year for most NHS staff. Nurses have been asked to vote on that deal, with results due next week. "	/news/health-63998488

health	British Transplant Games 2023 launches in Coventry	"ransplant survivors and organisers have launched a sporting competition that celebrates the ""gift of life"".
multi-discipline British Transplant Games is being held in Coventry in July 2023.
About 1,000 athletes plus hundreds of spectators are expected to boost the city's economy during the event.
It's the first time the city will have hosted the games and chairman Les Ratcliffe said there was no better place for it. 
Mr Ratcliffe, who also chairs the Coventry & Warwickshire Champions and Place Board, said the competition was ""really going to affect the economy locally"".
""It's becoming normal to see Coventry as a place to go and celebrate, as a place to go and do things, because we have the facilities and we have the can-do attitude to make it work,"" he added.
""There's something for everybody.... nobody's going to be left out, whether it's table tennis, darts or golf.""
Yuri Matischen, British Transplant Games organiser from MLS, said Coventry was a great transplant centre, with a ""unique place in transplantation"". 
""It's really important for people who have had transplants to be physically active, to improve their health and lifestyles, extend the life cycle of their organs,"" he said. 
rgest in the UK to promote organ donation, with donor families and medics also gathering to cheer athletes on, Mr Matischen added.
""We still need to have conversations amongst all our population about your personal wishes concerning organ donation... these games give a catalyst to that message,"" Mr Matischen said.
Sylvie, 10, who underwent an urgent liver transplant seven years ago after a rapid deterioration in her health, ""can't wait"" for the games to come to her city.
""I'll have all my family and friends supporting me. So no pressure,"" the Leamington Spa resident added.
Mother Sandeep said the Games were an opportunity for Sylvie to feel ""like a normal child with her fellow transplanted team members"".
""I love being part of a family that understands what we've all been through, and survived,"" Sandeep added.
Fellow competitor Luke Alexander, a former Coventry University student, was born with a rare condition called biliary atresia, which causes bile to be trapped inside the liver. 
When he was 11, his liver started to fail and his life was transformed by a donation from a 13-year-old boy.
Luke has since written to his donor's family about the active life his transplant enabled, including winning gold medals and breaking a cycling world record at previous games in Malaga and Newcastle.
""Events like transplant sport, where I've been able to meet and make friends that have had transplants and similar experiences, that helps you really appreciate the power of the gift of life,"" he added.
2023 event will take place at venues across Coventry from 27 to 30 July.

health	Hinchingbrooke Hospital: Documents reveal catastrophic collapse risk	"""likely"" collapse of reinforced panels in a hospital could be ""catastrophic"", new documents reveal.
A risk assessment for Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridgeshire found levels of concern over the use of Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (RAAC). 
rs were obtained via a Freedom of Information (FOI) request by campaigner Minh Alexander.
She said it was ""dreadful"" that staff and patients ""were expected to tolerate unacceptable risks"".
Caroline Walker, chief executive for North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust, said it was keeping ""a very close eye on the RAAC structural issues"".
""We are focusing on redevelopment plans for Hinchingbrooke which would see us build a new hospital on the site, thus eliminating our RAAC issues, by 2030,"" she said.
Reinforced planks made from RAAC have been used in roofs, floors and walls of NHS buildings and schools built in the 1960s and 1980s.
material has serious weaknesses, as seen at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, where ceilings are supported by more than 2,400 props.
Ms Alexander, who has campaigned on the issue, published disclosures from a dozen NHS trusts and organisations affected by the RAAC problem, including North West Anglia, which operates Hinchingbrooke.
""It is dreadful that trust staff and patients have been expected to tolerate these unacceptable risks,"" she said, ""and that trust staff have been forced to invest so much energy in managing dangerous, dilapidated buildings, instead of delivering care.""
risk document for Hinchingbrooke is similar to the one for West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds, which the BBC obtained last year. 
rue extent of the risk at the Cambridgeshire based hospital isn't known due to some of the RAAC panels not being surveyed because of access issues.
Also included in the FOI disclosure is a recently updated ""risk action plan"" and an ""emergency evacuation plan"". 
An NHS England deadline to remove the panels from across its estate has also been brought forward five years to 2030, according to the papers.
North West Anglia published a business case last year to be included among eight trusts to be selected for funding as part of the government's New Hospital Programme.  
ument states the hospital's main theatres are located in buildings constructed from RAAC which need to be replaced ""as soon as possible because of the structural safety issues"".
An announcement is expected in the coming weeks.
Ms Walker added: ""The safety of our patients, staff and visitors is of the utmost importance to us. 
""Our estates and facilities team are working on an ongoing rolling programme across the affected areas of the hospital site to ensure that we can be aware of any faults as soon as they arise, implement safety measures and carry out remedial works.""
She said construction of a main seven-theatre block was already under way at the rear of the site. 
Surveys across the NHS estate have revealed 34 buildings containing RAAC planks at 16 NHS trusts, according to a parliamentary answer in July. 
NHS has earmarked £685m to deal with risks relating to the use of the material at these sites, including structural surveys and the installation of ""failsafe"" measures to prevent collapse.
A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesman said: ""We have publicly committed to eradicating Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (RAAC) from the NHS estate and protecting patient and staff safety in the interim period, with the NHS approaching this on a risk basis, prioritising NHS Trusts of concern"".

health	Scoliosis: 'I removed my back brace just in time for my prom'	"A figure skating teenager now has near-perfect posture after wearing a back brace 22 hours a day for three years following a scoliosis diagnosis.
Olivia, from Nottinghamshire, was finally told she could take off the back brace just in time for her school prom.
17-year-old has become a scoliosis advocate for Sheffield Children’s Hospital, offering support to other young people with the same condition.
Lee Breakwell, consultant spinal surgeon at the hospital, said: “Olivia’s commitment and outcome of wearing the brace was excellent.
""Early diagnosis for scoliosis is key – contact your child’s GP if you spot any sign of uneven shoulders, abnormal waist symmetry or prominent ribs.
“The best early test for scoliosis is the forward bend, where a child leans forward, aiming to touch their toes. If the spine twists rather than curving forwards, they may have scoliosis.”

health	Broomfield, Basildon and Southend hospitals 'must improve' maternity	"Regulators have told a major hospital trust to improve staffing following an inspection of maternity units.
Care Quality Commission rated the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, and its three hospitals, as ""requires improvement"".
report said there were not enough staff at Basildon to keep babies safe.
rust hailed the ""positive findings"" in the report and said it has recruited more staff since the inspection.
""While [staffing] is a national problem affecting many hospitals, leaders must develop ways of minimising the risk to patients this causes,"" said CQC head of hospital inspection Zoe Robinson.
Basildon's maternity unit was rated ""inadequate"" in 2020 and it was ordered to urgently improve after failings were found in six serious cases.
unit however, along with the rest of the trust, was rated ""requires improvement"" in December 2021.
CQC, because of remaining concerns, inspected maternity at Basildon, Broomfield and Southend hospitals during August and September this year.
It also visited diagnostic imaging at Southend.
It said it spoke with 104 staff, 12 patients and relatives and reviewed 29 sets of care records.
rust is one of the largest in England, serving a population of more than 1.2 million, with about 1,800 inpatient beds and 15,000 staff.
Across the trust, inspectors found:
•Not all staff completed mandatory training
•Maternity services did not have enough staff with the right qualifications, skills, training and experience to keep women safe
•The trust did not always share learning from incidents
•Women using the trust's maternity services were not always triaged within target times
report however commended the trust for collaboration, its complaints procedure, feedback system and ""effective governance"".
CQC said the Basildon maternity unit did ""not have enough nursing and midwifery staff to keep women and babies safe"".
Data showed that whole-time equivalent midwife vacancies almost doubled to 48 between the 2021 inspection and 31 August this year.
report however noted the unit had two dedicated midwives for triaging, and that 100% of women were triaged within 30 minutes of arrival during five of the first seven months in 2022.
recruited 18 newly qualified midwives, four international midwives and - following the inspection - a further ""four experienced midwives"".
unit delivers up to 350 babies each month.
Acting trust chief executive Hannah Coffey said there were now 52 newly qualified midwives across the three hospitals.
""There are some very positive findings in this report,"" said Ms Coffey.
""We are seeing a sustained improvement which ensures we can always provide women with one-to-one care in labour.""
She added: ""We are an improving organisation with a dedicated workforce committed to providing the very best care.""
CQC also gave the trust a rating of ""good"" when it came to being effective and caring.

health	Gloucestershire midwives call for change in maternity services	"usands of people joined vigils across the country to highlight problems in maternity services.
Midwives and parents joined marches in Stroud and Gloucester, to protest against a ""staffing and safety crisis"".
A recent survey carried out by the the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) shows more than half of staff are considering leaving the profession.
One Gloucester midwife said safer staffing to provide the best quality care was needed.
""We need urgent change to ensure the right quality of care for the people of this country,"" Sharon Newman said.
Dozens of March with Midwives vigils have been held nationwide to highlight issues with staffing and working conditions.
Midwife Maria attended the march in Gloucester.
""Maternity services are not going to improve unless we get the correct staff levels of staff, as well as the right investment and incentives for students to come into our profession,"" she said.
In the survey carried out by the RCM, it found 57% of midwives planned to leave the NHS in the next year.
""Midwives are being driven out of the NHS by understaffing and fears they can't deliver safe care to women in the current system,"" the RCM said.
urvey also found the highest level of dissatisfaction was among midwives who had worked for the NHS for five years or less.
Midwife Paige, from Gloucester, said: ""At the moment, we are providing the best care we can, to the best level we can.
""But it could always be better - we want people to have the very best care possible.""
A spokesperson for The Department of Health and Social Care, said: ""We value the hard work of midwives and are committed to supporting them.
""We are investing 127 million pounds into NHS maternity services to boost the workforce and improve neo-natal care.""

health	Michael Watt: Review finds 'significant failures' in patient treatment	"A review of the clinical records of 44 patients who died under the care of former neurologist Michael Watt has found ""significant failures in their treatment"" and ""poor communication with families"".
While this review looked at a sample of cases in which people died, potentially thousands more could be affected. 
review arises from a 2018 recall of 2,500 outpatients who were in Dr Watt's care at the Belfast Health Trust.
He worked there until 2017.
About one in five patients had to have their diagnoses changed.
rate review into 44 deaths was conducted by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) at the request of the regulator, the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA).
It highlighted concerns over clinical decision-making, prescribing and diagnostics. 
It reveals a misdiagnosis rate of 45% among this group of patients, twice that for living patients.
Speaking to BBC News NI, the RQIA's chair, Christine Collins, said the outcome of the review was ""shocking and gut-wrenching as so many had experienced unpleasant deaths which they ought not to have done"".  
In a litany of complaints, the panel said Michael Watt was often a poor record keeper, that he did not refer to patient notes which were often kept on scraps of paper and that cases were not taken seriously. 
He was also found to be ""rude and unhelpful"". 
Michael Watt review endorses concerns, says watchdog boss
review into deaths was limited and has been likened to a pilot project. 
Its terms of reference was also limited which meant the panel was confined to how much they could investigate. 
It is also unprecedented as no other review on this scale has been carried out on patients in Northern Ireland who died under the care of one doctor.   
In almost half the cases reviewed the panel did not consider the diagnosis to have been secure; also they noted in several cases the review of death certification, or referral to a medical examiner or coroner, was recommended.
Potentially that could mean the reopening of some cases by the coroner if he is approached by families to do so. 
Briege Donaghy, the chief executive of the RQIA, said it was a ""powerful report"" which had ""vindicated"" the concerns of patients and relatives about some of the drugs that were incorrectly prescribed.
""They were boxed in, if you like, into a diagnosis that may not have been their actual condition and that led them down a pathway of treatments that were inappropriate, medications that were inappropriate - for some with devastating consequences,"" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. 
Ms Donaghy said the report ""demands change"" and people were now asking the RQIA to take action. 
""Our questions in future must be more probing. They must get into the culture of an organisation and say to people who work there: 'Are you afraid to speak up? Are you supported to speak up? Are you working with colleagues that worry you - that you're concerned about their practice?'""
Colin Armstrong's late mother Ruth was misdiagnosed by Michael Watt in 2001 and prescribed medication for epilepsy.
""While I'm glad that the RCP have admitted that my mother did not have epilepsy... they have failed to investigate the potential impact on her health of the drugs she was prescribed,"" he said.
Mr Armstrong said the report was ""limited in its scope"" and was ""just the beginning"" of the work that needed to be done.
An independent inquiry and a separate review of those people who had died while in Michael Watt's care was launched in 2018.  
Earlier this year, the inquiry found there were numerous failures, that opportunities were missed by the Belfast Trust to identify problems with the neurologist's practice and that earlier intervention by the trust would have ""made a difference"".   
review into deaths also identified concerns or omissions and their potential to lead to harm in almost half of the cases examined, including that some treatments were unnecessary and invasive. 
Also in several cases, the review team believed patients had been ""denied holistic supportive care that may have made their condition and ultimately end of life care, easier to manage"". 
In October last year, Dr Watt was removed from the medical register after he made a voluntary application - meaning allegations about his work could not be heard in a tribunal by the General Medical Council (GMC).  
Since the launch of the inquiry in 2018, the focus has been on the experience of both patients and families.  
Both the independent inquiry and the review of deceased patients found communication between Michael Watt was poor, as was communication with other consultants.   
found that the overriding theme of Dr Watt's clinical records tended to be ""brief"". 
However, correspondence with private patients held in his private clinics was found to be a lot more ""detailed"". 
A number of recommendations were made including:
PSNI said police were currently considering the findings of the various reviews and investigations, namely: the General Medical Council, The Royal College of Physicians, the RQIA and the Independent Neurology Inquiry. 
""We will continue to liaise with the RQIA, Department of Health and Public Prosecution Service and will consider all relevant material before determining whether or not it will be necessary to conduct a formal investigation,"" a spokesperson said.
Department of Health said the review's findings were ""deeply concerning"" and it apologised to the families affected ""for the significant healthcare failings that have been identified"".
It said that along with the RQIA, it would assess the findings to inform ""next steps in the review of deceased patients' records""."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63784995
health	Cost of Living: UWTSD offers meal deals to support students	"Meal deals and extra support for mental health are part of a university's response to higher living costs.
University of Wales Trinity St David (UWTSD) has seen a ""significant increase"" in the number of applications for hardship funds.
university, in south-west Wales, said Christmas was especially difficult for students with children.
Welsh government said it offered the ""most generous student support in the UK"".
One student said the higher costs were limiting opportunities to socialise and take part in trips and clubs.
udents' union at UWTSD's Carmarthen campus has also seen more people coming to them for advice about money.
Ffion Anderson is in her final year of a primary education degree and said money was a big topic of conversation with friends. 
Ms Anderson lives at home but said her friends had struggled to pay rent and opted out of social activities with friends.
""It limits the freedom students have to enjoy, to go on nights out and trips with the university - it limits a lot,"" she said.
Gibbons, president of the students' union, said it was a ""scary time"".
Rent for university accommodation has been frozen this year, but Ms Gibbons said students living in private rentals had struggled. 
""We've got students coming to us who've only got £50 when they've paid all their bills."" 
Ms Gibbons said going out and socialising should not be considered a luxury and was ""something that students should be able to do"". 
Both Ms Gibbons and Ms Anderson said maintenance support from the government was not sufficient to cover costs. 
A high proportion of students at the university, which has three main campuses in Lampeter, Carmarthen and Swansea, are older and many have families. 
""We've seen an increase in stress and anxiety, which is easy to understand if you're struggling to pay your bills and if you're struggling to feed your family,"" said Rhys Dart, the university's director of student service. 
university has expanded its wellbeing services and more students are applying for bursaries. 
""Lots of our students are mature, so they've got the same pressures that we've got in terms of family life and heating and feeding the family, and then pressures of study on top as well.""
In the university canteens, a new deal offering soup and a roll for £1 has been introduced. 
A food hub offers items for free for students or staff who need it, ""no questions asked"".
""We know that if students are going to lectures hungry they're not going to get the best out of their lectures, and we want to do all we can to support them,"" said Kelly Williams, who is in charge of facilities. 
Universities Wales said institutions across Wales were ""proactively"" helping struggling students through financial and practical support such as ""financial education workshops, warm spaces, and the provision of free food and grocery items"". 
Director Amanda Wilkinson said it was a particularly difficult time for students ""from low-income backgrounds with caring responsibilities or estranged families"". 
Welsh government said it understood the extra cost of living pressures on students. 
It said grants and loans increase each year in line with the National Living Wage and universities had put extra help in place.
""Anyone who's struggling financially should contact their students' union or student support services,"" it added in a statement."	/news/uk-wales-64053322
health	Two NHS Scotland unions accept 7.5% pay deal	"Members of two major NHS unions in Scotland have voted to accept an improved pay offer. 
risk of strike action in the health service by members of Unite and Unison.
But ballots of GMB, Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) and Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members are ongoing. 
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf welcomed the decision by Unite and Unison to accept the ""record pay offer"". 
Last month the Scottish government tabled an improved deal averaging 7.5% to health workers threatening industrial action.
It will see most NHS staff in Scotland get a rise of just over £2,200 a year.
Unite represents about 1,500 Scottish Ambulance Service staff including paramedics, advanced practitioners, planners and administrative workers.
It confirmed 64% of its health membership voted to accept the proposal which was tabled following talks involving unions, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf and NHS Scotland.
Sharon Graham, Unite general secretary, said: ""The improved offer for NHS Scotland workers which is worth over 11% for the lowest pay bands is a testament to the resolve of our members. 
""They were prepared to take the difficult step in taking industrial action but only because they had no other option left. 
""Unite makes no apologies for fighting for better jobs, pay and conditions in the health service because NHS Scotland workers should be fairly rewarded for the outstanding work that they do day in and day out."" 
Unison, Scotland's largest NHS union, announced that 57% of health members voted to accept the offer after a digital ballot closed at noon. 
union said negotiators would now work with the Scottish government, NHS employers and other unions to process the pay award as soon as possible.
Wilma Brown, chairwoman of Unison's Scotland's health committee said: ""Whilst this decision ends the immediate threat of industrial action, it is not a win for government - it is a warning. 
""It was far from a unanimous decision and many of the NHS professional grades feel badly let down. 
""Almost half of Unison NHS staff voted to reject this latest pay offer, and many who did vote to accept, did so reluctantly.""
Unison Scotland represents 50,000 NHS workers including nurses, midwives and support staff, such as domestics, porters and administrative workers. 
Scottish government will be hugely relieved that Unison and Unite members have accepted the latest pay offer.
But it does not mean the threat of industrial action in the NHS has gone.
GMB will say on Wednesday whether its members have voted for the deal. A ballot by the Royal College of Nursing continues until next Monday.
RCN result in particular is not a foregone conclusion.
Still the pay deal accepted by Unison and Unite will be looked at closely by their colleagues in the rest of the UK.
It is likely to be a line in the sand for them - something they can judge their offers against. 
It will also give negotiators an insight into the least amount that might be acceptable to their members.
GMB Scotland last month suspended a 26-hour ambulance strike and has put the new deal to more than 4,000 members in a vote. 
Senior organiser Keir Greenaway said staff needed to be valued to ""tackle the chronic understaffing crisis across NHS front line services"" after a decade of cuts and the Covid pandemic.
union is expected to announce the results of its ballot on 14 December.
CSP's consultation will also close on Wednesday. It has recommended its members accept the pay offer.
Meanwhile, the RCN, which has yet to confirm strike dates after members across the UK voted for action, said the new deal ""still does not meet our members' expectations"". 
It had asked for at least 5% above inflation, which is currently 11.1%. 
RCN's ballot of its 30,000 NHS members closes on 19 December but it is not clear when the result will be announced.
Scottish government previously said the new deal was an unprecedented pay deal for front-line employees, including nurses, paramedics, allied health professionals and healthcare support staff.
Annual pay rises under the latest deal would range from a flat rate payment of £2,205 for staff in Bands 1 to 4 and up to £2,660 for staff in Bands 5 to 7, backdated to April. 
represents an increase of 11.3% for the lowest paid workers and delivers an average uplift of 7.5%, a government spokesperson said. 
Mr Yousaf said: ""We have engaged tirelessly with trade union representatives over recent weeks, leaving no stone unturned to reach an offer which responds to the key concerns of staff across the service.
""This offer of over half a billion pounds underlines our commitment to supporting our fantastic NHS staff.""
He added that a newly qualified nurse would see a pay rise of 8.7%, and experienced nurses and would get uplifts of between £2,450 and £2,75.
retary said: ""We are making this offer at a time of extraordinary financial challenges to the Scottish government to get money into the pockets of hard working staff and to avoid industrial action, in what is already going to be an incredibly challenging winter."""	/news/uk-scotland-63947246
health	Out-of-hours GPs facing most difficult Christmas ever, says BMA	"It has been the most difficult Christmas on record for out-of-hours GP services, a senior doctor has said.
Northern Ireland Chair of the British Medical Association (BMA), Dr Tom Black, said record numbers of patients were attending GP services.
Southern Trust said its out-of-hours department was prioritising urgent calls.
On Christmas Eve, Western Urgent Care received 640 calls - up from 158 calls last year, Dr Black said.
Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said the health service had been overwhelmed. 
""It has been for the last two months,"" he said. ""Since September we've really struggled to keep things going.""
Dr Black said emergency departments have also been very busy.
Almost 800 people were waiting to be seen at EDs at midday on Wednesday, according to Health and Social Care figures. 
Some 333 patients were waiting for more than 12 hours. 
Dr Black said Wednesday was set to be ""the busiest day we've ever seen"" and warned people to only visit EDs in an emergency. 
""It's a shared resource,"" he said.
""We all pay for this through our taxation and we all understand you can't be pushing to the front of the queue because you've got a sore toe - we have to look after the vulnerable people in our society, particularly today.""
Dr Black said a number of different factors were to blame for the pressures being felt across the health service, including strep A, Covid-19, flu and respiratory viruses and vomiting bugs.
""We've seen a confluence of an extraordinary number of infections peaking at this time, all different things - we haven't seen anything like it before.
""We knew coming out of Covid it would be more difficult but we didn't expect this to be so severe.""
He said the situation has meant healthcare staff have been forced to prioritise patients.
""I think that's what we'll have to do for the next few months,"" he added.
""We don't have enough resources to see everybody with a sore throat or a cough - we're trying to make sure the most vulnerable and the sickest are being seen.""
ressures facing Northern Ireland's health service have been well documented. 
Earlier in December, the BBC News NI was given access to the emergency department at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital.
Staff said they were treating the acutely unwell in areas which were ""overcrowded and undignified"" and a senior consultant likened the scenes to ""battlefield"" medicine.
In August the British Medical Association warned almost 100 GP practices in Northern Ireland had sought emergency support or were in crisis.
Meanwhile, a consultant at Londonderry's Altnagelvin hospital said the emergency department there has been ""utterly overrun with patients"".
""I have just done a round of the A&E here and there are 50 patients and 34 cubicles,"" Dr Paul Bayliss told BBC Radio Foyle on Wednesday morning.
""More often than not when I pick up their notes it says 'has been unwell for five or six days'. There are more people here than there is physical space to accommodate them,"" he said.
He urged people with non-urgent conditions to stay away.
""If it isn't an emergency then this isn't the place to come at this time because we are talking 12 hours (wait).
""I am sorry the service is so poor but we are really flat to the mat with emergencies only and doing our very best for the people who are really, really sick,"" he said."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64080298

fection has led to nine deaths of children in the UK in recent months.
Dr Stephen Hughes, of Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, said hospitals in Essex had seen ""very, very high attendances from parents who are very worried"".
NHS advised people to familiarise themselves with the symptoms.
Dr Hughes, a consultant and a senior lecturer in medicine at Anglia Ruskin University, said the rise in children being presented was ""putting particular pressure on hospitals around the county and nationally"".
He said he had been ""briefing his team to make sure they know what they're looking out for"" when presented with poorly children.
Strep A: Broomfield Hospital doctor gives advice to worried parents
mptoms of a strep A infection can include a sore throat, sandpaper-like skin rash, high temperature, swollen glands and muscle aches.
Medical experts said symptoms were usually mild and could be treated with antibiotics.
ria could cause scarlet fever, which mostly affects young children, and could also be treated with antibiotics.
Very rarely, strep A can cause invasive group-A streptococcal infection (iGAS), which can be deadly.
Dr Hughes, who has worked in emergency services for 12 years, said: ""The main message is, most sore throats, mercifully, are self-limiting viral infections.""
He said parents should also look out for the tongue being coated with a red rash and children not wanting to eat which meant ""medical treatment should be sought"".
Dr Hughes said: ""If a child is complaining of a little bit of a sore throat, but is still managing breakfast, is still managing to eat and drink, it probably isn't invasive group A strep.""
Dr Krishna Ramkhelawon, Southend's director of public health, said strep A cases had presented themselves earlier than normal this winter.
me there was a similar outbreak was in 1718, he said.
""The level of immunity in the system is very low, there's a lot of challenges there, a lot of people getting concerned and turning up to hospital because they are concerned,"" said Dr Ramkhelawon.
He added that at this time of year there were a lot of respiratory illnesses and it was important to observe good hygiene, such as washing children's hands and using tissues. 
Worried parents should contact their GP and the NHS 111 service in the first instance before going to hospital, he said. 
Dr Ramkhelawon said there was no reason at present to introduce preventative antibiotics in schools.

health	Dorset patients offered targeted lung cancer tests	"People in Dorset are being offered tests for lung cancer as part of a national screening programme which is being rolled out in the county.
Patients at Royal Manor Health Care GP surgery on Portland are the first to be assessed for possible lung scans.
More than 40 areas in England are trialling the checks for current and former smokers aged 55-74.
NHS England said the Targeted Lung Health Check programme would cover all areas of the country from 2024.
Lead nurse Hana Spencely said patients across Dorset would be texted over the next two to three years and invited for appointments to test their suitability for CT scans.
She said: ""What we want to do is find things at an earlier stage and primarily save more lives.""
In November, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust in Hampshire said it picked up 80% of suspected cancers at a curable stage through the screening, compared to 30% before.
Lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer deaths in the UK, accounting for about a fifth of cases.
Symptoms include a persistent cough, chest infection and breathlessness, although there are usually no signs in the early stages.

health	Cruise ship with 800 Covid cases docks in Sydney	"A holiday cruise ship carrying about 800 passengers with Covid-19 has docked in Sydney, Australia. 
Majestic Princess cruise ship arrived at Circular Quay, having sailed from New Zealand.
About 4,600 passengers and crew were aboard the ship when it docked - meaning around one in five had Covid.
utbreak is reminiscent of the Ruby Princess cruise ship Covid outbreak of early 2020, where at least 900 people tested positive and 28 died.
Marguerite Fitzgerald, the president of cruise operator Carnival Australia, said a large number of cases started to be detected about halfway through the 12-day voyage. 
All cases were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, she said. 
Staff would be assisting all guests who have tested positive ""with accessing private transport and accommodation to complete their isolation period"", she said. The ship will soon depart for Melbourne.
Asked about comparisons between the Majestic Princess and the Ruby Princess - which also belongs to the same operator - Ms Fitzgerald said: ""Since then, we as a community have learnt a lot, a lot more about Covid.""
utbreak comes as Covid cases rise across Australia. 
In New South Wales, 19,800 new cases were detected in the seven days to Friday. "	/news/world-australia-63605824
health	Hull: Families of dementia patients to get unrestricted visits	"Families of patients with dementia will be given unrestricted visiting to Hull hospitals after a national campaign.
Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (HUTH) pledged to uphold John's Campaign - which looks to give families an active role in hospital care.
g with memory impairments may become uncomfortable without familiar family members, or doctors may not spot the early signs of distress.
""Family members are the experts here,"" lead matron Karen Harrison said.
mpaign, which started in 2014, encourages hospitals to allow essential care givers greater access to patients to improve the overall experience for people with dementia.
HUTH said despite the ""unprecedented pressure on hospitals"", it was important to give essential care givers unrestricted access at both Hull Royal Infirmary and Castle Hill Hospital.
""We're shifting mindsets from ""allowing"" family members to visit to actually promoting and encouraging visiting for these often-vulnerable patients while they're in hospital, away from familiar surroundings,"" Ms Harrison said.
""[Family] know these patients best so can tell us what's normal for their loved ones, explain their likes and dislikes and what works to calm and comfort them if they become distressed.""
Covid measures remain at the hospital, including a request for family members to test negative before visits, or the wearing of appropriate PPE if on a ward.
Meal times, which are usually off-limits to visitors, will be open for family members to help relatives eat or drink.
""Other patients on wards who do not have memory impairment or dementia often ask why their families can't benefit from unrestricted visiting too but, once we explain John's Campaign, they understand we're acting in the best interest of these often-vulnerable patients,"" Ms Harrison added.
Staff are to receive training around the campaign, which was set up after Dr John Gerrard died after a ""catastrophic"" stay in hospital, the campaign said.

health	Ex-ministers back bid to end zero hours contracts in social care	"wo former health secretaries have backed a campaign to end the use of zero hours contracts in Scotland's social care system.
Alex Neil and Malcolm Chisholm joined academics and patients' relatives in signing an open letter to the current health secretary Humza Yousaf.
It calls for the eradication of zero hours contracts to be included in the National Care Service Bill.
Scottish government said it opposed ""inappropriate use"" of such contracts.
Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart said companies bidding for government work are evaluated on their fair working practices ""where it is relevant and proportionate to do so"".
r states that, according to the Office for National Statistics, about a million people across the UK are employed on zero hours contracts.
It adds this includes 74,000 in Scotland, of which 20% are employed in the health and social care sector. 
Mr Neil, who served in Alex Salmond's SNP government from 2012 to 2014, branded the contracts ""pernicious"" and warned the health and social care sector was in the midst of a major recruitment crisis.
He said: ""Social care shortages are leaving patients stuck in hospital taking up much needed hospital beds at a cost of £4,000 a week when they should be recovering at home with social care support. 
""Zero hours contracts are a barrier to people working in the care system and should be banned.""
r also claims social care staff shortages are driving delayed discharges in Scotland's NHS.
roblem, often referred to as ""bed blocking"", occurs when a patient continues to occupy a hospital bed despite being clinically able to be discharged. 
Malcolm Chisholm, who held the health brief in the Labour-led coalition between 2001-2004, said social care staff ""performed heroically"" during the Covid pandemic.
He added: ""They deserve to be treated with dignity and respect with a secure contract, fair pay and decent working conditions. 
""The Cabinet Secretary has the opportunity to end the use of these contracts once and for all.""
Zero hours contracts do not oblige employers to provide a minimum number of working hours but neither do they oblige employees to accept any of the hours offered by their employer.
Workers on zero-hours contracts are still entitled to statutory annual leave and the national minimum wage.
Although such contracts have been controversial, some say they provide flexibility to people such as students, parents and those with other caring responsibilities.
But critics say that zero-hours contracts create insecurity for workers and are used by employers to undercut wages and avoid holiday pay and pension contributions.
Chris Peace, campaign director of Zero Hours Justice, said the contracts were a ""stain on Scotland's care system"". 
She added: ""They cause anxiety and fear amongst workers leaving them financially insecure and unable to plan their lives. 
""They are a key factor in the recruitment crisis in the Scottish care system which, according to the Scottish government, has a 43% vacancy rate.""
Ms Peace called for the contracts to be scrapped in the National Care Service Bill.
Scottish government last month defended its plans for a new National Care Service.
government says the system will be the biggest shakeup of public services since the creation of the NHS and will end a social care ""postcode lottery"".
But questions have been raised about the cost of setting it up and what it means for local decision-making.
Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart said the fair working practices of companies bidding for Scottish government work were already evaluated.
He added:  ""This includes the inappropriate use of zero hours contracts and this will be extended to the National Care Service. 
""The Fair Work in Social Care group has developed a set of minimum terms and conditions, including investigating ways to end the misuse of zero hours contracts within the social care sector, and work to deliver these standards with key stakeholders has begun."" "	/news/uk-scotland-63922257
health	Urology inquiry: 'Fear' prevented colleague challenging Aidan O'Brien	"A consultant urologist has said he personally regretted not recognising that a deeper look was required in to the work of a   fellow doctor.
Mark Haynes said fear prevented him from tackling Aidan O'Brien personally. 
He was giving evidence to a urology inquiry examining the work of Mr O'Brien, a consultant urologist.
quiry is also examining the Southern Health and Social Care Trust's handling of urology services before May 2020.
Mr Haynes took up a post as consultant urological surgeon at Craigavon Area Hospital in 2014, joining a team which included Mr O'Brien. 
In October 2017, Mr Haynes took up a managerial position of Associate Medical Director within surgery and elective care, which covered urology. 
Counsel for the inquiry, Martin Wolfe KC, said that through Mr Haynes' evidence the inquiry wished to obtain ""a better sense of the clinical and administrative issues in instants of concern relating to Mr O'Brien and the way he practised which lead eventually to the events of 2020 - the early alert and the announcement of this inquiry"".
Mr Haynes told the inquiry that he was a colleague of Mr O'Brien and aware of how he worked. He said he was also aware that ""he was a challenge to challenge"".
""I also had an awareness of his personal connections with members of his family within the legal profession, his personal connections with the chair of the board and the rumour mill had told me that a previous AMD (Associate Medical Director) had been accused of bullying when trying to tackle Mr O'Brien. 
""So I guess the answer to why didn't I personally tackle him is because I had to work within a team with him, essentially it was a fear thing,"" he said. 
Mr Haynes told the inquiry he didn't want to find himself in a difficult working relationship as a result of things he had heard on the rumour mill or grapevine rather than anything documented.
""I should have tackled him personally but I was coming in late to this with a many-year history of other people attempting to tackle it to no success and it becoming part of normal working arrangements for him,"" he said.
Counsel for the inquiry spoke about urology services in Northern Ireland and specifically in the southern trust, saying ""the resources to meet the demand is wholly inadequate"". Mr Haynes agreed.
Mr Wolfe, the counsel for the inquiry, said that the inquiry ""may well understand that the pressure created by the absence of resources to deal with demand"" but that ""issues [in relation to Mr O'Brien] were there to be discovered and could have been discovered with relative ease"".
Mr Haynes again agreed and said: ""I personally regret not recognising that a deeper look into Mr O'Brien's practice was required at the time of the MHPS (Maintaining High Professional Standards) investigation being instigated. 
""What was looked into were the issues that had been identified but we didn't proactively look for other things"".

health	Scarlet fever cluster found at County Down school	"Dozens of children at a County Down primary school are suffering from strep A bacterial infections, including cases of scarlet fever, a principal has said.
Michael Peacock, from Brackenagh West Primary School near Kilkeel, said that two children had been hospitalised.
Most strep A infections are mild and get better with antibiotics, but some people who catch it can get very sick. 
mother of a five-year-old boy at the school with scarlet fever urged parents to watch out for the symptoms.
Nikol Chambers' son AJ is now recovering, but she worried something was ""badly wrong"". 
Public Health Agency (PHA) says the number of cases of scarlet fever in Northern Ireland had been rising in the ""past few months"".
Figures show there were at least 104 cases in November, up from 43 in October. 
Mr Peacock said most of the cases at his school involved children in primaries one and two. 
""We've had quite a lot of sickness over the last week or two which is not unusual for this time of year in schools,"" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.
""But we discovered this morning just a raft of cases connected to the strep A bacterium and we have a total of 32 children off today.""
Elsewhere, the Public Health Authority has recommended ""all children in P1-P3"" at Black Mountain Primary in Belfast take a preventative course of antibiotics. 
It issued a letter to parents at the school after a pupil was diagnosed with ""a severe form"" of ""Group A strep"". 
re had also been a case of chickenpox at the school. Developing both conditions at the same time can cause a more serious infection. 
Strep A can cause a range of illnesses. Most cases are mild - a sore throat or a skin infection that can be easily treated with antibiotics.
Some people develop scarlet fever, which causes a skin rash (that feels like sandpaper) and flu-like symptoms, including a high temperature.
Very rarely, strep A can cause something called invasive group A streptococcal infection or iGAS, which can be deadly.
PHA said it had received reports of 29 cases of iGAS so far this year. This figure, while higher than last year, is lower than in previous years, it said.
In the rest of the UK, eight children have died due to complications from strep A bacterial infections since September.
Of those, seven were  in England and the other was a seven-year-old in Wales.
Mr Peacock said that while the vast majority of the sick pupils at Brackenagh West were being cared for at home, two had been hospitalised as a result. 
Most of those affected in the school are young children with 21 cases in primary one and two classes and a further 11 spread across other classes.
""This would be quite typical as obviously younger children are more susceptible to germs. Their immune systems are less mature,"" Mr Peacock said.
Ms Chambers said she didn't suspect scarlet fever when her son became sick. 
""He had the cold, he had a runny nose, he had a bad cough. He just wasn't feeling great and then he got a temperature,"" she said.
""Then he started with a rash on his chest and it coated him right down to his toes, like a blanket and about six hours. 
""His was tongue turned white, he wouldn't drink anything, and the temperature just was through the roof.""
Ms Chambers said she then took AJ to the out-of-hours GP in Newry on Saturday where he received antibiotics to treat the infection.
""I just knew there was something really badly wrong,"" she added.
Ms Chambers said AJ is now recovering from the infection with treatment. 
Parents need to be vigilant - that is the message from health officials and local doctors.  
While those looking after children may be nervous about this unfolding story, it is important to remember a majority of cases are mild. 
UK is experiencing an outbreak because for two years, and during the pandemic, children didn't mix and their systems are not immune to a number of different infections.  
re is a warning that the number of cases of both strep A and scarlet fever will rise over the coming weeks.
It is highly contagious so the advice from experts is keep sick children at home.  
Parents of children who deteriorate quickly should seek urgent medical advice.
Mr Peacock said that he is aware of other schools in the area that have reported higher than normal cases of the infection. 
""We know that there are still a large number of our parents who are waiting to see their GPs about this, so at the moment we don't have a full picture,"" he added.
As a parent, if you feel that your child seems seriously unwell, you should trust your own judgement. Contact your GP if:

health	Major incident declared on Saturday by Northern Health Trust	"Northern Health Trust declared a major incident on Saturday night, BBC News NI understands.
A major incident means there are too many patients for staff to deal with safely. 
Senior trust executives took the decision after the emergency department at Antrim Area Hospital reached full capacity. 
On Sunday the Belfast Trust appealed to any available nursing staff for help during the nightshift.
rust said it was ""under extreme pressure"" due to an increasing number of sick patients.
Northern Trust used social media to appeal to the public ""not to attend under any circumstances. ""
In a statement on Sunday, the trust said it had warned for some time that such a situation could happen.
A spokesperson said a ""disproportionately high number"" of critically ill patients arrived at Antrim Area Hospital in quick succession, leading to the senior emergency department consultant that the department could no longer operate safely.
""This was a regrettable position to be in, but in the circumstances it was the only safe and appropriate response,"" they added.
""The trust is continuing to work closely with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and other Trusts to coordinate an appropriate response given regional pressures.""
Declaring a major incident is rare and a sign the hospital is under extreme pressure.  
Under such circumstances there is a call out for staff to come into work. 
Ambulances were also redirected to use other hospitals. 
A potential major incident was declared at Antrim Area Hospital in February but was stood down after several hours.
On Sunday morning the trust said the emergency department remained under extreme pressure and asked people only to attend if their condition was life-threatening or urgent.
It stressed that people in such circumstances should attend, but anyone else should stay away.
""The Antrim site currently has a high number of very ill patients who require admission into the hospital and therefore our priority today has to be patient discharge,"" the trust spokesperson said.
Alliance Party assembly member for East Antrim, Danny Donnelly, said urgent action was needed to prevent a major incident happening again."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63607776
health	A&E wait: Frustration over disabled man's 48-hour ordeal	"A care agency boss has described the NHS as ""a joke"" after a disabled man was forced to wait for 48 hours in A&E.
One of David Williams' clients, who has severe epilepsy, had been taken to the Grange Hospital near Cwmbran, Torfaen, complaining of chest pain.
Mr Williams said he had to wait in a chair with no food for 36 hours.
Aneurin Bevan health board said delayed hospital discharges and winter viruses had led to longer waits at A&E.
Mr Williams, the responsible individual and director of Prestige Care Agency Services, said the NHS was a ""failed system"".
In November, Healthcare Inspectorate Wales' (HIW) said urgent improvements were needed at the hospital, which opened only two years ago.
Recalling the incident on 5 December, Mr Williams said: ""He was held for 36 hours in a chair and for about 12 hours in a side room whilst they tried to admit him into hospital for tests. 
""He didn't understand really what was happening, he wouldn't have been comfortable.
""How we as a company funded by local authority end up with the ultimate responsibility in that situation was very, very frustrating.""
He said one member of his staff stayed with the man for more than 24 hours before handing over to another member of staff. 
He added the patient missed out on food and drink as he was asleep each time the food trolley went by, and when he was awake, staff were too busy to bring him any refreshments.
Not only this, his staff were unable to leave his side and get food and drink for themselves.
""I think next time it happens we'll certainly be sending down food and drink because it's a long time just sat there waiting for something to happen, being hungry and thirsty,"" he said.
rompted him to write to the Western Mail newspaper, where he described the NHS as ""a failed system"" and ""a joke"". 
But he does have some sympathy for hospital staff.
""A&E is carnage, they're rushed off their feet,"" he said.
""I don't think it was any fault of the hospital, I think it's a fault with the system.""
He added: ""There's a fear of destroying the myth that the NHS is fantastic and the best in the world... I think it needs a fundamental shake-up.""
Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said: ""We are sorry that Mr Williams is unhappy with the care that his service users have received and the long waits they experienced.""
It said it was experiencing ""unprecedented demand"" for its services.
""With high numbers of winter viruses spreading throughout our local communities, this is putting severe pressure right across our system, which has, unfortunately, meant that patients are waiting longer to receive care in the emergency department than we would want,"" it added. 
It said its hospitals had at least 300 patients who were medically fit for discharge but were awaiting some form of support at home before they could leave hospital due to the significant challenges facing social care.
""This results in a delay for these patients returning home, which, in turn, is affecting the overall flow of patients through our hospitals.""
It asked Mr Williams to contact the health board directly to discuss any concerns.
Mr Williams, whose company provides supported living services to 17 people and employs 40 staff across five homes in Torfaen, said situations like this were leaving people working in his industry with the ""horrendous decision"" over whether taking a service user to A&E was in their best interest. 
""You have to make these unqualified decisions really, which is pretty uncomfortable I have to say,"" he said. 
He said recently when an elderly man fell out of bed, staff called for an ambulance and were told there was not one available.
""The guidance says you leave him on the floor. You cannot leave an 88-year-old man on the floor for hours and hours so in the end I said 'just pick him up',"" he said. 
""We're at the point where we're having to make decisions which we shouldn't be making."" 
He said if services like his could access GPs over Zoom where they could actually see the patient it would be a big help, adding: ""But I guess it's all about the money at the end of the day.""
Welsh government said: ""We were sorry to learn about the patients' experiences and we are supporting the health board and partners in providing better outcomes for patients who need access to urgent and emergency care.""  
It said the health board was receiving an additional £3m annually as part of an investment of £25m it was making to transform urgent and emergency services across Wales. 
Mr Williams believes the solution to ending long waiting time at A&E is a properly funded care system.
""The care sector is not funded properly,"" he said.
""The care sector is largely a fragmented private industry which has organically grown to meet the need of society.""
Mr Williams said although there was a ""lot of pleasure in helping somebody who's got a disability"", until carers received better pay there would always be a problem with recruitment and retention in his industry.
""I don't think £9.90 or £10 an hour is enough for the level of responsibility that they have,"" he said. 
""We have a lot of service users with choking risk, it's a constant worry, you have to be watching people all the time.
""It never lets up - there's no Christmas, there's no Easter.
""When people can go and work in retail for more for almost zero responsibility by comparison we see people going in that direction,"" he said. 
In November, 67.3% of people were seen within four hours at A&E, higher than October but still significantly worse than the pre-pandemic performance. The target, which has never been met, is 95%.
month also saw more than 10,000 people waiting more than 12 hours in A&E; the target is that no-one should wait that long.
Meanwhile, ambulance response times were the joint worst on record - with only 48% of ""red"" life-threatening calls arriving within eight minutes. 
Although the number of hours lost to handover delays outside A&E units had improved on the previous two months, 24,250 hours were still ""lost"" with ambulances unable to hand patients over at emergency units beyond the 15-minute target time. 
So far this year, more than 260,000 hours have been lost."	/news/uk-wales-64038636

health	Northampton Covid drug trial starts for immuno-compromised patients	"A man with blood cancer has received his first treatment in trial of a new Covid-19 drug that aims to protect immuno-compromised patients.
John, 57, from Northampton, said he hoped it would provide ""protection"".
University Hospitals of Northamptonshire NHS Group has become the first UK trust to set up the trial. 
It is looking at the use of Covid vaccines alongside Evusheld - a new antibody treatment that aims to prevent Covid infection.
Rapid-Protection study, to run across the UK, aims to recruit 350 patients in total.
It is for people with weakened immune systems - caused by cancer, inflammatory conditions, as a result of organ transplants or other serious health conditions - who remain at high risk of catching Covid-19, said the NHS trust, which runs Northampton General Hospital and Kettering General Hospital.
John was eligible due to having myeloma and has had to shield during the Covid-19 pandemic.
""Covid remains a real worry for immuno-supressed people and I hope that by taking part in the trial it will help to support future treatments for people with these conditions,"" he said.
""Of course it also gives me additional protection and enables me to feel a bit more relaxed about Covid.""
Dr Jane Parker, consultant haematologist leading the study, said: ""The opportunity to get Evusheld to better protect against Covid-19 is monumental for our immuno-compromised patients, especially as many have continued to shield or significantly restrict their lifestyle since the beginning of the pandemic.
""Hopefully, our patients can now start to get their lives more back to normal and enjoy some of the freedoms the rest of us have experienced since the Covid rules were relaxed.""
Evusheld is a combination of two long-acting antibodies that bind to the spike protein on the outside of the SARS-CoV2 virus and prevent the virus from entering human cells, the trust said. 
It has been shown in clinical trials to prevent Covid-19 infection for up to a year after a single dose of two injections, giving protection within a few hours.
udy, sponsored by the Centre for Trials Research at Cardiff University, was being led by Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

health	Autumn Statement: Is money for schools, social care and NHS enough?	"Alongside the tax rises and deep spending cuts announced by the government in the Autumn Statement, more money was also set out for three key areas.
Our correspondents look at what impact additional funding for schools, social care, and the NHS might have.
More investment in a ""public service that defines all our futures"". That's the chancellor's approach to funding schools in England. Jeremy Hunt has promised an extra £2.3bn per year for schools for the next two years.
School leaders say it sounds like positive news, but they'll be looking closely at the detail.
Among the financial pressures facing schools is the government's promise of a 5% pay rise for most teachers - which they have to find cash for in existing budgets. And they have to help pupils catch up after school closures during the pandemic. 
School spending per pupil dropped in real terms during the 2010s. Today's cash increase means that it will be back at where it was in 2010, according to analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).
School funding, the think tank says, it now predicted to be greater than the growth in schools' costs. But the question teachers will still be asking is: will it be enough to take on all the challenges they face?
udget for the NHS in England was already due to increase by nearly £5bn next year to more than £157bn. A similar rise was planned the following year - the final one of a five-year settlement agreed under Theresa May's government.
But despite this, NHS bosses had warned the health service was still facing a £7bn shortfall in 2023-24 because of inflationary pressures. So by giving an extra £3.3bn next year - and the same the following year - the chancellor has gone some way to plugging the gap.
funding has been welcomed by NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard. But huge challenges remain. 
NHS is desperately short of staff - one in 10 posts are vacant - while the backlog in cancer care and hospital treatment continues to grow.
roblems cannot be solved by money alone. They require more staff to be trained and equipment and buildings to be upgraded - things that can take many years to achieve.
For many older or disabled people - and their families - the chancellor's statement should ease the immediate problems of getting support from a care system in crisis. But it also delays the promised help with the long-term catastrophic costs some face. 
£86,000 cap on care costs was due to start next autumn, but it will now be pushed back by two years. 
Sir Andrew Dilnot, who devised the policy more than a decade ago, says the delay is ""extraordinarily disappointing"". He describes the need for reform as ""critical and urgent"" and says without it, the most vulnerable are left with no idea how they will cope financially, should they need care. He also believes it breaches a Conservative Party manifesto pledge. 
government says the reform money and council tax flexibility will provide the care sector with up to £2.8bn extra next year and £4.7bn the year after. But nearly two-thirds of that money is dependent on England's councils increasing local taxes by the maximum allowed. That is unlikely to happen. 
A large chunk of the money will be needed for wages in a care sector that has 165,000 vacancies. The rise in the minimum wage to £10.42 an hour will be welcomed. But to compete with supermarkets and hospitality, care companies are likely to have to pay more."	/news/uk-63662726
health	Calls for mental health support for unpaid carers	"A woman who became a full-time carer to her husband after he became paralysed has said that mental health is ""a big problem"" among unpaid carers.
Nicky Probert-Thompson, 59, from Swindon, worked as a catering manager until her husband, Mick, 75, had a stroke in 2014, just 14 months after retiring from a military career.
She is calling for mental health support to be more accessible.
""Until you care for someone, you don't realise how lonely it is,"" she said.
After suffering a stroke, Mick was left paralysed down his left side and Ms Probert-Thompson said their situation had become more difficult since the pandemic.
""Before retiring, Mick's role in the RAF allowed him to travel the world. Getting out and about, as well as catching up with life-long friends was so important to us,"" she said.
""But with the pandemic, it has been harder. I am still worried about contracting Covid-19 because if I passed it onto him he would be seriously ill.
""It has been quite isolating for us, and not being able to interact with other people has really affected my mental health,"" added Ms Probert-Thompson.
She has received support from Swindon Carers Centre which has provided welfare and benefit advice and organised social events with other carers.
Ms Probert-Thompson said the charity, which supports more than 21,000 unpaid carers, had been ""an absolute lifeline"".
It will soon be able to offer further support after being awarded £40,000 to employ a specialist mental health practitioner.
grant, from RUHX (the official charity of the Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) and NHS Charities Together, will fund the position for two years.
Stuart Ilbury, head of service delivery at Swindon Carers Centre, said the people it supports are reporting increased anxiety, stress, depression and loneliness following the pandemic
""Some unpaid carers are near crisis point. They feel like they can't go on - they also feel guilty for thinking this.
""The new practitioner will be helping carers with concerns or issues they have and identifying their mental health needs and what support may be needed,"" added Mr Ilbury.
Ms Probert-Thompson said that mental health support is ""absolutely vital for unpaid carers"".
""I need the opportunity to talk confidentially about my feelings, with someone who can understand my situation but remains separate from it.
""Unpaid carers often feel forgotten but this support makes our hard work and bravery feel that little bit more recognised,"" she added.

health	Nottingham nurses take to picket line 'with heavy heart'	"Nurses in Nottingham have joined industrial action across Britain - in their biggest strike in NHS history. 
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is calling for a 19% pay increase  - which the government says is unaffordable. 
Nurses at the Queen's Medical Centre and City Hospital voted for action but colleagues at King's Mill in Nottinghamshire will work as normal. 
monstrating said offering higher wages was a key part of retaining staff and offering safe care.
government has said it is ""hugely grateful"" to nurses but the pay rise being demanded is unaffordable.
Nurses in a picket line outside Lings Bar Community Hospital in Gamston are part of action across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
RCN official Neil Thompson, who has 46 years experience as a district nurse, said the decision was taken with a ""heavy heart"". 
""When it came to actually completing the ballot paper I was in tears,"" he said.
""This is probably the most emotional thing we have ever done and it is awful, it is really dreadful we are having to do this - but we feel we have no choice.
""We want to achieve safe staffing for our patients and unless we get paid fairly we won't be able to persuade people to stay in nursing.""
Healthcare assistant Daisy James said she earned just over £10 an hour and felt she could make more in a supermarket.
""That's quite bad if you think about it, with the amount of responsibilities we have day in, day out,"" she said.
""I'm not taking anything away from supermarket workers who do a fantastic job but we are responsible for patient safety and our pay doesn't reflect that at all.
""With the cost of living, staff are leaving because they can't afford to do the job they are doing.""
As a specialist renal nurse, Rachel Humphreys said she earned more but the problem was wider than individual salaries
""There is not enough staff to care for the patients - nationwide there are over 40,000 nurse vacancies.
""We are passionate about our jobs and it has been really difficult to make the decision to come out but we feel as if we have no choice.""
Katie Manning, a lung cancer nurse, said it took a lot to convince her to come out on strike.
""Our patients are suffering everyday and I think to myself how many patients die or are not being cared for adequately on wards across the country,"" she said.
""We know it because we work there and see it, making decisions about which patients get painkillers or which get drips or do you care for the old lady that has been incontinent in the bed, or care for the dying patient and their family?
""You are reprioritising all day long and usually with three or four nurses off - it is draining and demoralising.""
NHS Nottinghamshire said planned surgery and outpatient appointments would be affected by the nurses' strike action.
Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Integrated Care Board, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust will see services affected due to the ""reduction in staff"".
Patients were told to ""attend your appointment as planned"" unless contacted by the NHS.

health	Mum's bid to raise awareness of pregnancy-related heart condition	"A mother who nearly died from a rare heart disease that affects pregnant women is campaigning to raise more awareness about it.
Paige Wilson from Coleshill in Warwickshire, was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy days after giving birth to her first child.
She said she wanted parents and health professionals to understand the dangers if not diagnosed quickly enough.
use the heart to enlarge, and cause heart failure.
Mrs Wilson said she fell ill four days after a healthy pregnancy and routine birth at George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton three years ago.
""I started to feel really unwell,"" she said.
""I just felt like I couldn't get out of bed and there was something that wasn't quite right and I didn't necessarily know what was wrong.""
She was rushed back to hospital where doctors initially diagnosed sepsis, but two days later it was confirmed she had peripartum cardiomyopathy. 
Her condition declined rapidly, leading to her family being called to her bedside.
""They were basically having to call my mum and my husband to come and say goodbye because I'd got that ill,"" she said.
""I was on oxygen, I had a catheter in, I couldn't move, I couldn't breath and I did think I was going to die.""
She went on to recover but missing out on the first few weeks of her son's life took its toll mentally, she said.
""I just couldn't cope and I genuinely felt like I didn't want to wake up every morning,"" she said.
""I felt like I didn't bond with [her son] because I felt like this awful mum because I'd missed practically his first couple of weeks.""
Experts at the hospital where she gave birth said more needs to be done to spot the signs of peripartum cardiomyopathy early.
About one in 2,000 pregnant women will develop the condition either before or after giving birth, Dr Dawn Adamson, consultant cardiologist at University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire, said.
""We're doing a lot of work to train the future generations who are looking after the maternity services, the obstetricians, the cardiologists, the GPs, primary care, to try and be aware of all these different conditions that they're not going to see that frequently,"" she added.
Maternal, Newborn and Infant Clinical Outcome Review released this month - found 229 women died within six weeks of giving birth between 2018 and 2020 - a 24% increase on the previous three years. 
Of those deaths, 61 were related to heart disease - a quarter of which were from cardiomyopathy - and 90% of the women who died from heart disease had no pre-existing condition. 
Mrs Wilson said she hoped raising awareness could save lives. 
""I'm hoping this is just another way of getting people to think about it and want to learn more and hopefully save people's lives.""

health	South West Acute Hospital: Surgeon hits out at 'parish pump politics'	"Surgeons have ""voted with their feet"" to temporarily withdraw emergency general surgery from an Enniskillen hospital, a surgeon has said.
Western Trust said it made the call for public safety reasons as it had problems recruiting surgical staff to South West Acute Hospital (SWAH).
Barry McAree accused some politicians of engaging in ""parish pump politics"". 
Sinn Féin's Colm Gildernew said this was a ""disgraceful"" way to refer to ""genuine concerns"" about the decision.
former chairman of Stormont's health committee said it was an ""extremely disappointing failure by the trust to recruit surgeons"" where a need had been identified. 
""This is not and nor should it be represented as any kind of transformation,"" Mr Gildernew told BBC's Good Morning programme. 
He said it was an ""unplanned collapse"".
Mr Gildernew added that assurances had been given that this was a temporary situation. 
However consultant colorectal and general surgeon, Barry McAree, said he hoped the decision would not be temporary.
""I believe that this should have happened a long time ago, as do many others,"" he said.
He added that had the Bengoa review been ""properly implemented"", it would have happened in a more controlled fashion.
Bengoa was a major report into the health service in Northern Ireland in 2016.
""The fact is that surgeons and patients are better looked after in bigger units with longer travel times even taken into the mix,"" Mr McAree said.
""The word emergency has been overplayed by many with regards to emergency general surgery,"" he said. 
""Unfortunately, realistically, us general surgeons just aren't that important and the majority of what we deal with is classified as urgent.
""Even hours travelled to bigger units gives better results than continuing with small poorly resourced units.""
He said surgeons wanted to work in bigger, better staffed and better equipped units.
Dr Brendan Lavery, director of the Western Trust, said the decision was not going to lead to ""adverse outcomes"", and denied that this was a permanent measure.
He said he accepted that many people would be disappointed.
""This has happened because we were unable to recruit general surgeons.
""We have tried everything we can. In an ideal world, I would prefer to leave things as they are.""
He said the trust was currently trying to recruit surgeons. 
Despite saying the move was temporary, the trust did not say when it expected emergency general surgery would resume.
mergency department and other services will continue to operate as normal. 
Other - mostly lower grade - surgeons will remain on site at the County Fermanagh hospital.
will stabilise patients before they are transferred by ambulance to the likes of Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Londonderry, Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh or Sligo University Hospital across the border in the Republic of Ireland.
Local groups have said they are concerned that the road infrastructure does not support a quick transfer of patients from Enniskillen to Altnagelvin, Craigavon or hospitals in Belfast.  
In a further move, it has been confirmed the hospital is to become Northern Ireland's third elective surgical hub.
In October, emergency general surgery was ""temporarily"" moved from Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry to Craigavon Area Hospital. 
Emergency general surgery relates to the treatment of patients with conditions such as acute abdominal pain, infections, bleeding and trauma.
It includes operations such as removing a patient's gall bladder, appendix or part of the bowel.  
Western Trust said existing services including its emergency department and obstetrics remained unchanged.
It added there would be ""minimal to no impact"" on the other existing services at SWAH.

health	GPs in Northern Ireland an endangered species, senior doctor says	"GPs in Northern Ireland are an endangered species, a senior doctor has said. 
Dr Frances O'Hagan, a partner GP at the Friary Surgery in County Armagh, said most surgeries did not have enough GPs or reception staff to meet demand.
umber of GP practices in Northern Ireland has fallen by about 9% and nine surgeries have recently handed back their contracts.
However the number of individual GPs has increased.
Dr O'Hagan said GP practices were on their knees.
Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Dr O'Hagan said low staffing was the main reason people would struggle to get an appointment.
""All we want to do is give good care to our patients, but the problem is we have no GPs and no reception staff,"" she said.
""GPs are an endangered species. There are not enough of us, they are not training enough of us and they're not facilitating keeping more of us in practice.""
Dr O'Hagan said she worked more than 50 hours a week, despite officially only working for three days part-time.
remaining two days are spent on administration and following up with patient's conditions. 
She said a GP's workload would make it impossible to see patients face-to-face on a full-time basis. 
""We have to be very careful,"" she said.
""If we don't make general practice an attractive place to work, if we don't bring young GPs in and we don't stop GPs like myself retiring, we're going to have nobody left.""
Friary GP Surgery has 9,000 patients on its books who live within a six mile radius and is one of three GP surgeries on the same site. 
Patients can call to arrange an appointment on weekdays between 08:30 and 09:00 GMT.
Reception staff Mary McIlroy and Rosie Prunty told the BBC the surgery usually received up to 130 calls during this period.
""You can feel your stomach churning a wee bit just before the phones start,"" Ms McIlroy said. 
""It's stressful. You feel under pressure because the phones ring all the time and you're trying to get people sorted as best you can.""
Ms Prunty said patients could become frustrated when appointments filled up.
""Most of the time they're good, but there's the occasional time that people don't react well whenever they're told the appointments are all gone for the day,"" she said. 
At the end of March 2022 there were 319 GP surgeries in Northern Ireland, down from 350 in 2014. 
umber of registered patients per practice rose by about 15% - from 5,500 to 6,340 - in the same period.
Despite the decrease in practices, the number of GPs, excluding locums, went up by 20% to 1,419 since 2014.
rman of the British Medical Association's Northern Ireland GP committee Dr Alan Stout said GPs' workload had increased dramatically over recent years. 
""We're trying to deliver a better service for our patients and we are more frustrated than anybody else whenever we can't deliver that. 
""The problem that we have at the moment is no matter what way you do it, whether its an appointment system, whether its phone-first, we just don't have the capacity to meet the demand - the demand is just phenomenal.""
Dr Stout said he believed GPs could deliver a much better level of primary care but practices needed to be realistic over the service they could provide.
""We need the whole system to change and to pivot to out-hospital care, keeping people at home and having the staff and the resource within primary and community care to achieve that,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Department of Health has confirmed a potential new contractor has been found to take over a County Antrim GP practice that was earmarked for closure.
Ballymena Family Practice was due to close in January after its doctor handed back their contract.
A total of 3,204 patients were to be moved to other surgeries, but the Department of Health said it is finalising arrangements for a takeover and it hoped this process will be completed by 31 January.
""The existing contract holder has agreed to maintain the contract for the month of January until this process is completed,"" it added.
A second GP practice in Ballymena, which has 3,840 registered patients, is due to hand back its contract on 31 May.
Department of Health said the contract would be advertised imminently, and applications sought from interested parties.
It said ""both practices are continuing to offer services as normal""."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63954968

University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust said it was also down to challenges with ambulance handovers and difficulties discharging patients.

health	Health secretary hints NHS will get more money	"Health Secretary Steve Barclay has strongly hinted that the NHS will be given more money in the chancellor's Autumn Statement on Thursday.
At a conference of NHS managers, he denied reports at the weekend he had suggested the NHS did not need any more funding than already planned.
He said he had been having lots of talks with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt.
And he suggested he should be judged tomorrow on whether he had succeeded in getting extra for the NHS.
As part of the Autumn Statement, the chancellor is expected to announce a swathe of cuts to public spending.
NHS England's budget is already due to rise by nearly £5bn next year to £157.4bn under a five-year spending deal agreed four years ago.
But NHS bosses have warned it is still facing a £7bn shortfall next year because of inflationary pressures.
Speaking at the annual conference of NHS Providers in Liverpool, Mr Barclay took issue with a newspaper report that suggested he did not think the NHS needed extra.
""That is completely incorrect,"" he said. ""The good thing about this is colleagues in the room will be able to see tomorrow. 
""I can assure you that the Treasury wouldn't allocate any money to the department if the department said it didn't need it, given the fiscal situation.""
He said there had been a ""lot of discussion"" with the chancellor, adding one of the things he could bring to this role having held ministerial positions in No 10 and the Treasury was being ""very good at understanding how best to make the case"" for health.
""I can absolutely confirm that we do need support to meet those inflationary pressures,"" the health secretary said.
And he went on to urge delegates to judge him on the results of Thursday's announcement, saying they should see whether ""it is true or not that we don't get a penny and I've not asked for a penny"".
If the NHS budget did rise, it would also lead to more money for health in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as well as England.
But he once again re-iterated his stance that the 17% pay rise the Royal College of Nursing had asked for was unaffordable, saying it would take money away from other parts of the NHS.
He also gave details of when an emergency winter pot of £500m to help hospitals would be released.
money was announced in September, but there had been growing concerns among health managers that the funding had not yet reached the frontline.
Mr Barclay said it would come in two tranches - the first in early December and the second in late January.
money has been earmarked to tackle delayed discharges - where patients who are ready to leave hospital cannot because of a lack of support in the community.
Saffron Cordery, interim chief executive of NHS Providers, said: ""Trust leaders will welcome reassurances from the health secretary that he has been batting on the NHS's behalf in negotiations with the chancellor."""	/news/health-63648936
health	Northern Ireland faces 'cancer epidemic' without strategy - study	"Northern Ireland is facing a ""cancer epidemic"" if an effective strategy is not implemented, it has been warned.
A study has found that Northern Ireland is at the bottom of an international league table for cancer plans and policies.
Prof Mark Lawler said outcomes for breast cancer patients have gone from the best in the UK to the worst in the last decade.
report's authors have called for reforms of cancer services.
Prof Lawler, from Queen's University, is a senior author of the report which has been published in the medical journal Lancet Oncology.
udy looked at the relationship between consistency of cancer policy and improvements in five-year survival for seven cancers in 10 countries or jurisdictions across the world.
uthors found a correlation between consistent cancer control policies and better five-year survival for cancer patients over time.
Financial Times reported that the research shows the UK as a whole lagged behind other counties when it comes to cancer survival rates.
But, speaking to Good Morning Ulster on Wednesday, Prof Lawler said ""Northern Ireland was bottom of the league table in relation to consistent cancer control policies and their relation to outcomes"". 
He said that the health service in Northern Ireland has only implemented one cancer strategy in the last 20 years but that this was effective. 
""Ten years ago I would have been presenting on this and talking about Northern Ireland, for example, having the best outcomes for breast cancer in the United Kingdom,"" Prof Lawler added.
He described the findings of the report as ""very disappointing"" and said authorities are failing cancer patients. 
Prof Lawler said: ""We've had a vacuum in relation to policy, in relation to investment and that has led to significant challenges for our health system.""
re is an existing cancer strategy ""sitting on the shelf"", Prof Lawler said, but it has not been financed or implemented. 
""We can do it, but we need to do it now. If we don't do it now, we're going to have a cancer epidemic that's going to follow us in Northern Ireland and that's just not good enough,"" he added.
Department of Health said it ""fully agrees"" with Prof Lawler on the importance of having the necessary funding in place to implement the cancer strategy.
In March, the then-health minister Robin Swann announced a new 10-year cancer strategy with an estimated initial investment of £2.3m for the first year.
A department spokesperson added: ""The former minister also approved new governance structures that would provide strategic direction, oversight and ensure effective decision making to support implementation of the cancer strategy.
""However, in the absence of an agreed multi-year budget for health and a significant projected overspend for the year, the ability to strategically plan beyond 2022/23 is extremely challenging."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63638453

Around 250 brightly-illuminated farm vehicles will drive along a 19-mile (30km) circuit through Leicestershire on Saturday.
ractor run is taking place in the memory of Keiran Hopkins, 19, who died in September.
Money is being raised for mental health charity Mind. 
Keiran's brother Liam Hopkins, from Elmesthorpe, has arranged the event.
He said: ""I think Keiran would smile if he saw our tractors.  He absolutely loved tractors and farming.  I've got mine ready and it looks like the Blackpool Illuminations.
""It's pretty hard to explain how Keiran's death has hit us as a family.
""We didn't see any of the signs that he wasn't feeling right and I wish we had because we might have been able to help.
""All we can do now is try to get something good out of a tragedy.
""We're raising money for Mind to help it set up a base in Leicester. We want people to have more access to the help and support that could have helped Keiran.""
fundraising target was £5,000 but more than £7,000 has been pledged and the organisers hope the final total will top £10,000.
Liam added: ""It's going to be quite a sight. We'll be going pretty slowly and collecting money in buckets along the way.  
""We're going to have a great laugh because we know that's exactly what Keiran would want.""

health	Malawi starts landmark malaria vaccination drive	"Malawi has expanded a vaccination programme for children as part of a world-first, large-scale campaign against malaria.
RTS,S vaccine - more than three decades in the making - was developed by pharmaceutical company GSK.
Previous trials show it reduced cases of malaria by about 40% of the five to 17-month-olds who received it.
But Malawi believes it will still play a key role in the fight against the disease, which killed some 2,500 infants in the country two years ago.
""We're quite aware of its low efficacy... [but] in malaria control there is no single intervention that does it all,""  Dr Michael Kayange, the country's national malaria control programme manager, told the BBC's Focus on Africa.
""We're not saying that the malaria vaccine has come to eliminate malaria but it's one tool towards malaria elimination.""
Malaria has been one of the biggest scourges on humanity for millennia and mostly kills babies and infants.
But the disease, caused by parasites transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, disproportionately affects Africa: in 2020, the continent recorded 95% of malaria cases and 96% of malaria deaths. 
Children under five accounted for about 80% of all malaria deaths in Africa, according to the World Health Organization.
Dr Kayange said the new immunisation campaign will ensure that all children under five, even in the remotest parts of the country, will be covered.
first part will see 11 of the country's 28 districts will be covered, with 330,000 children expected to be vaccinated in this phase alone.
, which is being delivered through routine immunization programmes in Malawi, Ghana and Kenya, needs to be given four times - once a month for three months and then a fourth dose 18 months later.
RTS,S shares similarities with another malaria vaccine developed by University of Oxford. Both target the first stage of the malaria-causing parasite's lifecycle by intercepting it before it gets to the liver and establishes a foothold in the body.
re built using a combination of proteins from the malaria parasite and the hepatitis B virus, but Oxford's version has a higher proportion of malaria proteins. The team think this helps the immune system to focus on malaria rather than the hepatitis. 
rial results of the Oxford vaccine from 409 children in Nanoro, Burkina Faso, have been published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases. It shows three initial doses followed by a booster a year later gives up to 80% protection. "	/news/world-africa-63797178

health	Scientists say eight glasses of water a day may be too much	"New research has found that the recommended eight glasses of water a day may be too much.
Scientists from the University of Aberdeen discovered the recommended intake of two litres of water a day was often more than people needed.
Given around half of the daily intake of water comes from food, scientists estimate people only really need about 1.5 to 1.8 litres per day.
findings were published in Science this week.
Previous research into water requirements used surveys applied to small samples of people.
Prof John Speakman from the University of Aberdeen told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""The original estimate of two litres a day comes from a slight miscalculation.
""The water that we'd need to drink is the difference between the total water that we need to ingest and the amount that we get from our food.
""The way they estimated the amount from food was by asking people how much they eat.
""Because people under-report how much they eat, there's a misestimate and so you overestimate the amount of water that's needed.""
But scientists have now collaborated across the world to measure exact water turnover using a stable isotope technique.
urveyed 5,604 people from 23 different countries and aged between eight days and 96 years old.
Research involved people drinking a glass of water in which some of the hydrogen molecules were replaced by a stable isotope of the element called deuterium. 
It is found naturally in the human body and is completely harmless.
rate of elimination of the extra deuterium shows how quickly water in the body is turning over.
People with a higher water turnover usually need to drink more water.
Research found that this included those living in hot and humid environments and at high altitudes, as well as athletes and pregnant and breastfeeding women.
Energy expenditure is the biggest factor in water turnover. The highest values were observed in men aged 20-35, who turned over an average of 4.2 litres per day.
reased with age, averaging 2.5 litres per day for men in their 90s.
Women aged 20-40 averaged a turnover of 3.3 litres, which also declined to 2.5 litres by the age of 90.
But water turnover is not exactly equal to the requirement for drinking water, Prof Speakman said.
He said: ""Even if a male in his 20s has a water turnover of 4.2 litres per day, he does not need to drink 4.2 litres of water each day.
""About 15% of this value reflects surface water exchange and water produced from metabolism.
""The actual required water intake is about 3.6 litres per day. Since most foods also contain water, a substantial amount of water is provided just by eating.
""This study shows that the common suggestion that we should all be drinking eight glasses of water is probably too high for most people in most situations and a 'one-size-fits-all policy' for water intake is not supported by this data.""
He said the research represented a big step forwards in predicting future water needs.
But there can be negatives in drinking too much water.
""Clean drinking water isn't free,"" Prof Speakman said.
""If people on average drink half a litre more than they need and you multiply that by 40 million adults in the UK, that means that we're needlessly drinking and peeing 20 million litres of water that we have to supply. 
""There is a cost in doing that."""	/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-63755475

Of these, 267 people needed specialised care in critical care beds last week.
NHS England warns pressures on the health service continue to grow as viruses like flu re-circulate after a hiatus during the pandemic.
me last year, when social mixing was low, there were only 34 patients in hospital a day with flu.
Prof Sir Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: ""Sadly, these latest flu numbers show our fears of a 'twindemic' have been realised, with cases up seven-fold in just a month and the continued impact of Covid hitting staff hard, with related absences up almost 50% on the end of November.""
He warned this was ""no time to be complacent"" with the risk of serious illness being ""very real"" and encouraged those eligible to take up their flu and Covid jabs as soon as possible. 
Admissions among children under 5 have been high this flu season, as well as among older people. 
figures show, last week: 
report suggests NHS staff have also been affected by the spread of viruses during winter, with staff absences from all causes sitting at around 63,296 a day. This compares to 52,556 at the end of last month. 
In Wales, admissions with flu have been rising since the beginning of December, with 702 people in hospital with flu on Christmas day and 29 of those patients required critical care support.
Flu-related hospital admissions in Scotland have also been steadily increasing over the winter with the rate at 7.5 patients per 100,000 of the population, according to the latest figures. This is the highest on record since 2017.
figures published for Northern Ireland, for mid-December, show the number of positive flu tests in hospital have risen sharply compared to previous weeks. "	/news/health-64126654
health	All GPs to receive direct access to cancer tests	"All GP practices in England will be able to book cancer tests directly for their patients from later this month, NHS bosses say.
f GPs booking CT scans, ultrasounds and MRIs has been gradually rolled out in recent years, as community testing centres have opened.
NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard will announce later all GPs will now be able to do this.
GPs have previously relied on referring on to specialist hospital doctors.
Before referring, they have to identify clear symptoms the patient may have a specific type of cancer.
But only one out of every five cancer cases is diagnosed through these urgent GP referrals.
Patients with less clear symptoms face long waits for check-ups or are diagnosed only after presenting at an accident-and-emergency (A&E) unit or being referred to hospital for something else.
wo out of every five cancer cases are not diagnosed until they are at a later stage.
And Ms Pritchard will tell delegates at the NHS Providers annual conference of health managers, in Liverpool, on Wednesday, she hopes the new initiative will lead to tens of thousands of cancer cases every year being detected sooner.
re have been fewer than expected diagnoses since the start of the Covid pandemic, as fewer people attended checks.
And last week, the Macmillan charity warned of about 30,000 missing cancer cases.
Dr Martin Marshall, who chairs the Royal College of General Practitioners, said GPs were beginning to see more patients coming forward with cancer symptoms - and direct access to testing would help those whose symptoms were less clear cut. 
""The college has long been calling for GPs to have better access to diagnostic testing in the community,"" he said.
But patients also need faster access to treatment.
A BBC News analysis last week found the number waiting more than the target time of 62 days for treatment to start had doubled in the past four years across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Cancer doctors blamed, in part, a shortage of staff to provide treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Also at the conference on Wednesday, in his first major speech as Health Secretary, Steve Barclay is expected to set out more detail about how the government will tackle the growing backlog in both cancer care and routine operations as well as plans to reduce the high number of delayed discharges.
fact most patients ready to leave hospital cannot because of a lack of care in the community is cited as one of the key reasons for long waits in other parts of the hospital, including A&E.
On Tuesday, Labour shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told the conference 12 years of Conservative mismanagement had left the NHS and care system ""gridlocked"".
A Labour government would train more doctors and nurses - funded by abolishing non-domiciled status, under which UK residents whose permanent home is elsewhere may not have to pay UK tax on foreign income, he added."	/news/health-63642448
health	Strep A death of eighth child confirmed	"An eighth child has died from a severe strep A bacterial infection, it has been confirmed.
Morelands Primary, in Waterlooville, Hampshire, said it was ""absolutely devastated"" by the loss of one of its pupils.
Such deaths are rare, but, since September, seven other UK children have lost their lives due to complications of the disease.
Earlier, it emerged a 12-year-old pupil in south-east London had also died.
And there have been five deaths of under-fives in England and a death of a seven-year-old in Wales.
Reports say there are eight cases of severe strep disease in Scotland, but no deaths. It is not known whether there are any ongoing severe cases in Wales and Northern Ireland.
However, a cluster of scarlet fever cases has been identified at a primary school in County Down. Some people who have Strep A develop scarlet fever, which causes a skin rash (that feels like sandpaper) and flu-like symptoms, including a high temperature.
Morelands Primary School head teacher Alison Syred-Paul said: ""We are absolutely devastated by the loss of one of our young pupils and offer our sincere and heartfelt condolences to the child's family at this extremely sad time. We ask that the privacy of the family is respected. 
""As a precaution, we have been raising awareness amongst parents, carers and our school community of the signs and symptoms...and what to do if a child develops these.""
Richard Russell, head of Colfe's School in Lee, London, where the 12-year-old Year 8 pupil died, said the tragedy was ""wholly unexpected"" and had affected ""all members of the school community"".
He said the school was doing what it could to support the pupil's family ""who are seeking to come to terms with their devastating loss"".
Health experts say parents and doctors need to be vigilant and have a low bar for treating the contagious disease that is circulating earlier than usual this year. 
UK must brace itself for more cases, as levels of the bacteria circulating are thought currently to be high.
Most strep A infections are mild and get better with antibiotics. But some people who catch it can get very sick.
Four-year-old Camila Rose Burns is critically ill and on a ventilator in hospital because of a severe strep A infection, known as invasive group A Strep (iGAS). 
Her father, Dean Burns, from Liverpool, told the BBC's Today programme: ""She is still fighting for her life. She is really poorly, it is just devastating to us as a family. We can't believe this has happened.
""It progressed to something called invasive group A strep, which has now gone into her bloodstream and has devastated her body.
""I'm at a loss with it all, I just want our family back. The pain is unimaginable. She is just so beautiful and precious. She is just our special little girl.""
UK Health Security Agency's (UKHSA) chief medical adviser, Dr Susan Hopkins, said: ""We are concerned, and concerned enough to ensure that we wanted to make the public aware of the signs and symptoms that they should watch out for and of course to alert clinicians to prescribe antibiotics for these conditions.""
She says an early start to the strep A infections season in the UK could be a side effect of the easing of pandemic restrictions. 
""We are back to normal social mixing and the patterns of diseases that we are seeing at the moment are out of sync with the normal seasons, as people mix back to normal and move around and pass infections on.""
Strep A can cause a range of illnesses. Most cases are mild - a sore throat or a skin infection that can be easily treated with antibiotics.
Some people develop scarlet fever, which causes a skin rash (that feels like sandpaper) and flu-like symptoms, including a high temperature. 
Very rarely, strep A can cause something called invasive group A streptococcal infection or iGAS, which can be deadly. 
Invasive disease happens when the bacteria get past your body's immune defences.
Warning signs of invasive disease include:
Urgent, early medical help is essential.
UKHSA advises that anyone with a high fever, severe muscle aches, pain in one area of the body and unexplained vomiting or diarrhoea should call NHS 111 and seek medical help immediately.
Strep A can be treated with antibiotics.
Prof Jim McManus, current president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said the UK should expect more cases: ""It is a function of numbers. There are many more cases of group A strep around, and because there are many more cases, the number of severe cases will rise.
""We had four deaths in 2017-18,"" he added, comparing that figure to this year's total.
""It is a case for real vigilance. We seem to have forgotten that strep A is around, so we have to think strep A when children present with symptoms that could be Strep A. In some cases perhaps we had thought this had gone away because we had been thinking about other infections.""
As a parent, if you feel that your child seems seriously unwell, you should trust your own judgement. Contact NHS 111 or your GP if:

health	Medical group to end Moffat and Lockerbie GP services after a year	"A medical group has decided to stop providing GP services at two south of Scotland practices less than a year after taking them over.
Alba Medical Group started running the Moffat and Lockerbie sites in April.
It will end its contract on 31 May next year, prompting a tendering process to find new providers.
ractices - which serve nearly 10,000 people - were run by the local health board for a number of years prior to Alba taking over.
NHS Dumfries and Galloway's deputy medical director Dr Grecy Bell said the group felt it had ""no option"" but to make the decision.
""It follows the awarding of the contract in April, when Alba took on the challenge of strengthening the services offered at these practices,"" she said.
""This came after staffing had decreased within both practices, and the board had assumed direct control and management.
""Restoring them was always going to be a challenge, and it was always going to take time.""
She said Alba had tried to make changes to make the practices more sustainable and establish a team with a ""wide range of skills"".
However, she said it had come at an ""incredibly challenging time"" to achieve ""understanding and acceptance"" of the changes needed.
""Alba are within their rights to relinquish the contract for these practices, but it means that just eight months after the process to award the contract the work now begins to attract an alternate provider,"" added Dr Bell.
""Work has begun to invite expressions of interest from GP providers who would wish to assume responsibility for GP services out of Moffat and Lockerbie.
""As is well established, GPs nationally are in short supply, and finding GP partnerships to take on practices can be very difficult - especially once a practice becomes board-managed.""
She said efforts would be made to promote the contracts for the two towns ""as vocally and widely as possible""."	/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-63893646
health	Covid: Wales autumn vaccine boosters hit a million	"utumn booster programme for Covid vaccinations has passed the one million mark in Wales.
w stands at 1,023,594 boosters given out, according to the latest Public Health Wales figures.
But smaller proportions of key groups have been reached than earlier phases of the vaccine programme, which started two years ago this week.
Just under 78% of the over-65s have had the autumn booster and more than 86% of care home residents.
rs started being rolled out in September and around 8,300 doses are still being given out a day.
Around half of people in their 50s and early 60s have now been reached.
But this is far fewer than those who took up earlier doses of the vaccine.
Similar trends can be seen in other key groups, apart from care home residents, who have still been reached in high numbers.
So far, only just over half of healthcare workers have taken up the autumn booster offer.
re are also still more than 15,000 people - 30% - of people with a weakened immune system who have not taken up a booster yet.
Public health officials have admitted challenges in persuading people to take boosters this time round, with lives returning to normal and many people also having had the virus.
most recent infection survey from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests 95.9% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.
Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the vaccine programme meant far fewer cases of Covid were expected this winter.
""But we are not fully immune to the virus and we must keep our defences up,"" she said. ""Covid-19 and flu remain a threat, especially to older people and people with other health conditions.""
Wales has reached more of those in key groups than England with autumn boosters, although in a similar trend to earlier phases of the vaccine programme it is behind Scotland.
Meanwhile, figures for the flu vaccine programme, which has been run in parallel, shows similar uptake in older groups compared to the same point as last year.
But only a third of two and three-year-olds have had a flu vaccine so far, compared to more than 38% at the same point in 2021.
It was lowest in the Cardiff and Vale health board area, with less than 28% of children aged two and three being given a dose.
Only a third of NHS staff have also taken up a flu vaccine, compared to about 46% at the same point last year.
Dr Sir Frank Atherton, chief medical officer for Wales, urged people to take advantage of walk-in appointments - and for those who had not received an appointment to check with their health board.
""It's important to remember that Covid-19 has not gone away. Vaccination is still important for those in priority groups and remains our best form of defence against the virus.""
Dr Chris Johnson, interim head of the vaccine programme at Public Health Wales, said it was ""promising"" so many people had come forward for Covid boosters.
""It is vital that people take up the offer of their Covid-19 booster and their annual flu vaccine when they receive their invitation, so that we can continue to protect the NHS this winter,"" he said.
figures in Wales come as NHS England has urged people with weakened immune systems to take up boosters, with a third eligible still not coming forward there.
Douglas Twenefour, head of care at Diabetes UK, described vaccines as ""the safest, most effective way of protecting us from coronavirus and flu"", adding: ""People with diabetes have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if they get coronavirus.
""People with diabetes are also at a higher risk of developing serious complications from flu."""	/news/uk-wales-63860682

health	Strep A: Fundraiser in Muhammad Ibrahim Ali memory reaches £4,500	"A fundraising effort in memory of a four-year-old pupil who died from a strep A infection has raised nine times more than its target.
Muhammad Ibrahim Ali, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, died last month from the infection.
Described as a ""kind and thoughtful"" child, Muhammad attended Oakridge School and Nursery in the town.
Head teacher Stuart Cook initially hoped to raise £500. The current amount raised is more than £4,500.
money will be spent by the school on a ""lasting memorial"" to Muhammad with the remainder being donated to a charity of his family's choice.
Infections caused by Group A Streptococcus bacteria are usually mild with symptoms such as a sore throat or skin infections.
ug can also cause scarlet fever which can, in the majority of cases, be treated successfully with antibiotics and people make a full recovery.
However, in a very small number of cases, group A strep infection can get deeper into the body - for example, into the lungs and bloodstream - causing an illness known as invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS), which is much harder to treat.
Mr Cook described Muhammad as having a ""lot of life and energy"" and ""always smiling"".
""He was a very kind and thoughtful boy and always wanted to help his friends,"" he said. 
""It's been a tough couple of weeks but the whole school community has come together, supporting parents, and probably most importantly the children, perhaps who are worried and have questions.

memorial is due to be installed in Balm Green Gardens in spring next year.
Artists had been asked to propose ideas for a memorial tree reflecting themes gathered in the first phase of Sheffield's Covid memorial programme, known as Stories from the Pandemic.
Mr King, an architect and sculptor, said of his winning design: ""A willow has a strong trunk, which symbolises how people worked together to create the strength needed at such a difficult time.
""It's an honour to have been selected to create this sculpture and it's a big responsibility.""
He said his practice, George King Architects, would work with Sheffield steel fabricators on the piece to reflect the city's heritage.
ulpture would allow people to read stories of those affected by the pandemic and to attach temporary messages or ribbons, according to Sheffield City Council.
Balm Green Gardens, next to Barker's Pool, would be upgraded when the piece was installed to make it more accessible for people with disabilities, it added.
Council leader Terry Fox said: ""We've worked hard to get this point, so I'm really pleased work can now begin on the sculpture which will serve as a permanent memorial to those who have lost their lives, those who have worked above and beyond to keep people as safe as possible and those who have been affected by Covid.
""It sounds wonderful and I look forward to seeing it in place, as somewhere where anyone can go and just stand and look at it or inside it, to reflect, be thoughtful and show compassion.""

rried out last year at Basildon University Hospital in Essex revealed the high levels but the installation of a new ventilation system was delayed.
mixture, Entonox, was expected to be unavailable for three weeks.
Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust said there was no harm to mothers and babies.
rust also said other pain relief methods would be available.
""We're very sorry that women using the service won't have access to Entonox,"" said acting chief executive Hannah Coffey.
""While there has been no risk of harm at all to mothers and babies who have used the unit, prolonged exposure to the gas can lead to issues with vitamin B12 deficiency.
""We need to be sure that we are keeping our staff safe, so while we urgently install a new ventilation system we have taken the difficult decision to suspend the use of Entonox.""
Acute exposure to nitrous oxide can lead to anaemia, due to the vitamin B12 depletion, and has been linked to fertility issues.
In correspondence sent to staff in October, seen by the BBC, Ms Coffey said the delay to install a new ventilation system, following the tests conducted in Basildon's delivery suite in June 2021, was ""unacceptable"".
Ms Coffey said all maternity units in the trust, including community sites, would be regularly tested.
Windows were kept open and fans kept on during the investigations.
Pregnant members of staff were redeployed to other hospital areas.
In a statement released on Thursday, she added: ""Our midwives are contacting the families we expect to have their babies at Basildon over the next three weeks to talk to them about the options available to them.""
Val Wilcox, from the Essex branch of the National Childbirth Trust, told BBC Essex: ""It's going to be really disappointing for local women who are expecting to give birth in the next few weeks because they're going to have to rethink their options.
""But it's also really disappointing that the health of our precious midwifery team has been put at risk and put at risk for quite a while.""
Another maternity department in Kent, the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, suspended use of Entonox earlier in the week.

health	Why we should worry about what is happening in A&E	"A&E waiting time figures are once again the worst on record.
In the week ending 27 November just 61.9% of patients attending emergency departments were dealt with within the four-hour target.
And the problem is far more acute at Scotland's busiest A&Es.
risis in A&E shows what is happening across the whole system.
Separately, the number of hospital beds occupied by people who are medically well enough to go home is also at a record high.
means patients can't get into hospital because there are no beds and they can't get out because there is not enough social care. 
ressure this causes seeps into every single part of the system. 
Staff are stressed and burnt out while patients are at risk because they can't access the care they need. 
It is pretty obvious that when you are very ill, waiting for a long time in an emergency department is not a good idea.  
You only need to look at social media to see regular posts from A&E staff who describe how stressful and dangerous they feel things are. 
I get regular calls from emergency medicine doctors telling me they are in despair and can't cope with the relentless demand.
One consultant told me that they are taking more and more risks. 
g ensured a patient is not facing a life-threatening situation they are making the call that it is probably better to send them home to follow-up with their GP.
rnative could be the patient languishing on a trolley in a brightly-lit corridor for many hours before a bed becomes free. 
In Glasgow, doctors who feel they cannot speak publicly have talked me through the pattern of their daily handovers. They say phrases such as ""an unsafe environment"", ""no available resus (resuscitation) beds"" and ""patient's life is at risk"" are routinely documented.  
rs say they have seen patients die simply because they could not get to them in time. 
Last week the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) in Glasgow recorded its worst ever performance for A&E. Only 35.1% were attended to within four hours. The latest figures were only slightly better.
Scotland's busiest A&E - Edinburgh Royal Infirmary - and Forth Valley Royal near Falkirk have both had more than six out of every 10 patients waiting more than four hours.
Some days were even worse than the stats show.
A performance chart shared with me shows that at the QEUH, on Saturday 19 November, of 233 patients who showed up at the emergency department, only 21.9% of patients were seen within the target time.
One internal document I have been shown makes reference to 11 ambulances queued outside the hospital when there were no available spaces in A&E, which was four nurses and a consultant down. 
Some of the proposals outlined to stop ambulances getting stuck outside the hospital include offloading patients into corridors. 
One doctor spells it out - if this was an operating theatre, the staff would simply not be allowed to carry out surgery because it is not safe. But A&E can't close. 
""There needs to be a full inquiry into what is happening in our emergency departments,"" they say.
Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) has long said that delays in A&E lead to people dying unnecessarily.
It carried out research that suggests there could be one avoidable death for every 72 patients waiting between eight and 12 hours in A&E.
monthly figures show that in October there were 15,467 patients who waited more than eight hours.
re were 6,814 who waited more than 12 hours.
Both of these figures are record highs and, according to RCEM calculations, could be resulting in as many as 200 avoidable deaths in a month.
Last month the BBC revealed documents that showed senior health board leaders were concerned unscheduled care was ""going to fall over in the near-term before planned care falls over"". 
Minutes of a meeting of Scotland's NHS leaders in September show ideas on how to address this include discharging people from hospital after 23 hours.  
NHS is not actually overwhelmed, with the number of people arriving at hospital not radically different to any other time.  
real issue, they say, is delayed discharge - getting people home when they no longer need acute hospital care. 
But to fix that requires a radical improvement in social care and access to community health care. 
rge figures show that in October the average number of beds occupied by people who no longer need hospital care was 1,898, the highest figure since the current guidance came into place in July 2016.
As many as one in every six beds in a hospital is occupied by a patient who is medically ready to go home but can't. 
Of course it is not always straightforward to discharge patients who no longer require treatment in hospital. They may need major adjustments to their home if they can no longer manage stairs, for example, or need carers to help them dress, shower or eat. 
One doctor in Lanarkshire told me that things are so bad now, they can assess a patient on one shift and come back 24 hours later to find that same patient still in A&E waiting for a bed. That is despite the board adding extra beds into wards to try to increase capacity in their hospital to admit new patients.
As I said at the start, what is happening at A&E reflects the health of the whole system.
A nurse working in Edinburgh told me there can be many tears on a shift but staff support each other, pick themselves up and get on with the next shift. 
Patients are deeply frustrated they can't get through to their GP, or spend hours on the phone after dialling 111 - so they end up at A&E.  
Meanwhile health boards continue to call for patients to avoid coming unless it is a life threatening emergency. 
None of this shows signs of getting any better, any time soon. "	/news/uk-scotland-63859908

He has raised more than £1,000 for the charity OcuMel which supports people with ocular melanoma, a type of eye cancer.
Dylan's grandmother Pat died of an ocular melanoma in July 2020 and Dylan is doing the run in her memory.
""I miss her and feel sad that she is gone every day,"" Dylan said. ""But the reason I am doing this is so that others will not have to lose people like we did when my nanny died.
""Even though I feel sad, when I run I feel happy.""
Dylan decided to run 1,000 miles in a year on his 12th birthday in January.
His parents were surprised at first but they were moved when he said he was doing it ""for nanny Pat"".
Dylan's mother Sarah said Dylan was very close to his grandmother and found it difficult to cope with her death.
Running helped to clear his mind and improved his mental health, Sarah added.
Dylan started running four times a week.
""We were surprised and impressed - he managed to run on top of his chores, school work and rugby practice,"" Sarah said.           
""Ever since he started this challenge, he has been stronger and fitter than ever,"" she added.
Dylan will be running his last few metres during half time at the Bath Rugby game on 31 December.
""His picture will be up on the screen along with the fundraiser,"" Sarah said. ""We hope this will raise awareness around ocular melanoma.""

health	Fake Covid protection kits: 'How my undercover work helped convict preacher'	"A bishop who told his congregation they would ""drop dead"" from Covid if they did not buy his £91 protection kits has been found guilty of fraud. 
Bishop Climate Wiseman, 47, of Kingdom Church in Camberwell, south London, sold red yarn and bottles of oil, Inner London Crown Court heard.
Evidence against him included secret phone recordings and testimony from a BBC London investigation. 
Investigative reporter Guy Lynn explains how he exposed the fraud.
As I made my way to the stand in one of London's oldest crown courts, I looked up to see the packed public gallery of Bishop Climate Wiseman's supporters. 
I could feel them glaring down at me intensely. And in front of me, the man himself, accused of fraud, whose fate hung in the balance, seemingly staring through me as I moved to speak. 
As a journalist working on an undercover investigation, my first priority is to get the story right for the public. We are thorough and diligent, particularly with anything involving secret recording. 
But journalists aren't police officers - and the requirements of a TV investigation are not in the same league as law enforcement. 
I remember feeling my heart racing as I went up to give my oath, and nervous that this was something which was entirely out of my comfort zone. I would be addressing barristers and a jury about how we do journalism of this kind at the BBC and, in the case of Bishop Wiseman, how this work was absolutely critical for the fate of one man, who could potentially go to jail as a result of it. 
On the stand, I was first asked questions by the prosecuting lawyer Richard Heller about the genesis of this story which, I recounted, came in April 2020. 
We all remember that period, I said, shortly after the then Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, told the country they must stay at home, while large numbers of people were seriously ill in hospital as the best medical minds raced to better understand Covid-19. 
At the time, I had heard of many stories of scams targeting vulnerable people desperate for some protection from the virus. 
But the one that worried me most was about a church in Camberwell, led by a charismatic preacher, Bishop Climate Wiseman, who was seemingly trying to profit by selling very expensive bottles of oil that had first been sold as ""plague protection kits"". 
He and his employees - who were not on trial - claimed that anyone who purchased the kits for about £90 each would be ""protected"" from the raging virus and would have no need for social distancing, as they were fully protected and could not spread Covid.
I knew that I would be asked lots of questions about secret recording which, contrary to what many think or assume, is a highly complex process at the BBC. Such an investigation requires very high levels of evidence to even begin and a very high level of public interest to justify pursuing the story. 
Defence barrister Charles Burton seemed to suggest that this had been some kind of fishing ""exercise"", which had involved a level of deception by the BBC approaching the church- posing as migrant workers who had heard of the oil and were interested in it.
I explained the BBC never secretly carried out such an investigation without strong reasons for doing so and needed evidence in advance that can only be tested with undercover recording. I told him that any deception carried out had to be proportionate to the seriousness of what was being looked at, and kept to a bare minimum. 
ret recording at all, the topic needed to be firmly in the public interest - something I felt very strongly about in this case.
I explained to the court that at the time, in April 2020, we had received confidential tip-offs and reports that the church was touting this oil as a cure for Covid, despite having previously been warned by Southwark Council and being under investigation by the Charity Commission. However, these were just reports and we needed to test them.
In order not to arouse suspicion, it was essential to engage in a small level of deception and so a decision was made to approach the church by posing as migrant construction workers who were interested in buying the substance, and secretly recording what was said.
A Romanian journalist would go in and make a purchase. I would adopt an accent on the phone to conduct further questioning and appear as if I was a migrant worker in order to test and gather the evidence. The scene would then be set for the oil to be bought. 
As part of the evidence presented in court, the undercover recording we obtained through phone conversations with employees of Bishop Climate Wiseman's church - who, it was argued, were under his control - was played in open court. 
It is important to say that the BBC does not hand over its evidence from its stories lightly. It always considers very carefully the implications of doing so to the authorities, and that the bodies involved meet the legal criteria to be able to receive it. 
Romanian journalist was the one who went to the church to make the purchase. The oil, which came in a small bottle, labelled ""divine cleansing oil"" and some red yarn, was sold to him for £91. 
Although it was suspected the church had fraudulently made hundreds of sales to its flock promising protection from Covid, the sale on which the fraud charge was framed around was the purchase that the BBC made on 21 April 2020. This was the basis of the charges against Bishop Wiseman, who was in charge of the church and overseeing the sale. 
I was also pushed hard on the various conversations I have had with the church, which were recorded on a phone and also played in open court. I had posed as someone called Javier and had adopted a kind of Italian-Spanish accent.
I explained this was required because whenever we do an undercover recording at the BBC, we need to use only the amount of deception that is necessary. 
All the reports that had come in had repeatedly confirmed that while the church was seemingly selling the oil to its flock, and was openly advertising the product on a website, those who were not members and had been born abroad were the ones to whom the outlandish claims were being made. 
I needed to test those claims and this was one way, on the phone. In a moment of amusement, which led to a wave of laughter throughout the court, the defence conceded after nearly half an hour of the secret recording that my accent was ""pretty convincing"". 
I was asked to talk about those secretly recorded conversations, undertaken by ""Javier"" with the church's employees, and what was the thinking behind my questioning. Secret recording of anyone by the BBC is never for entertainment. The sole reason for it is to gain and test evidence. 
For me, the most important aspect of all this was to truly check whether the church was genuinely claiming that Covid could be cured. Were they really suggesting to those who might take the £91 ""cure"" that they were protected and would not have to socially distance? Had they actually done it already?
If so, this would be of huge public concern, particularly as the oil had seemingly been sold to a lot of people.  
Witnesses from the congregation, including nurses, said they were cured or prevented from getting Covid after using the oil by steam inhalation or rubbing it on their skin.
Wiseman also offered other products for sale, including an oil to help in court cases.
My calls were played loudly in court. One was with an employee who referred to herself as a minister, and there were more with others.
All of them explained to Javier how the divine cleansing oil would cure anyone of Covid and how users needed to inhale it through a hot towel after mixing it with some hot water.
""You've got your cleansing oil,"" said the minister who referred to herself as Sharon (and who was not accused in court of any wrongdoing herself). ""Inhale. Inhale. You're going to cough. Give them that product, you'll see the effect. You'll see that they'll recover from the Corona.""
One aspect of Bishop Wiseman's defence was that he was acting as a religious leader only. However, there was evidence from the BBC's recording that this was being framed as a commercial operation, which was a key aspect of the fraud case against him.
For example, we were told that if we bought a number of bottles, the price for them would fall dramatically - from £90 to £60 - as long as we purchased a few for those who needed them. 
And when another employee was asked whether people had been genuinely cured of Covid, the response was: ""So many. So many have been cured. Make sure they inhale properly and they know they're cleansed from it, so at least they can work together."" 
, the employees at the church were seemingly not oblivious to the attention of the authorities at the time, with one of them explaining how to act with regard to social distancing, saying that after buying the oil it would be fine to mix and ignore the rules inside, but more care was needed outdoors.
""When everyone's outside, you have to be cautious because the government put down those social-distancing rules,"" one said. ""You don't want the police to rock up there because somebody report you."" 
Southwark Trading Standards had launched its investigation using the BBC's evidence, following numerous warnings made to Wiseman. 
Indeed, in his own evidence at court, the preacher claimed his mixture, made from cedar wood, hyssop oil and olive oil, had cured at least 10 people who had the virus. He also claimed the investigators probing him were the ""antichrist"". 
Judge Nigel Peters KC told the court that Wiseman had carried out the fraud when ""there was fear amongst the public in this country"".
""This was being touted at a time when the public in this country were under the most intense pressure as to what would happen tomorrow,"" he said.
Speaking after the trial, Southwark councillor Evelyn Akoto said that there were a lot of vulnerable people at that time who were really scared and didn't know where to turn.
""And this was a potential cure, so a lot of people believed in it, unfortunately, and succumbed to pay high costs for something we know doesn't work.""
Wiseman will be sentenced on 13 January.

health	Great Yarmouth ambulance patient transport service suspended	"A private ambulance service has been suspended from transporting patients after inspectors said there was an ""unacceptable risk"" of harm.
Care Quality Commission (CQC) rated Grange Farm in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, as inadequate.
watchdog said 16 staff were suspended and its registered manager resigned after the inspection.
Ikon Ambulance Services Ltd, which runs the Grange Farm service, said it had employed ""new policies and procedures"".
""When we aren't assured people can be cared for safely, we don't hesitate to act,"" said the CQC's head of hospital inspection, Zoe Robinson.
""Grange Farm's operating procedures were unfit for purpose, which exposed people using it to an unacceptable risk of avoidable harm.""
Ikon Ambulance Services typically provides first aid support at events such as stock car racing, horse shows and agricultural shows - a service which is not part of its registration with the CQC.
However, inspectors said any medical transportation of patients from events, such as to hospital emergency departments, was regulated by the CQC.
Following the inspection at Grange Farm on 6 September, the watchdog concluded:
CQC said the service suspended 16 members of staff after the visit because there was no record of a DBS check in their file.
registered manager was not available during the inspection and by the following day they had resigned, inspectors reported.
CQC said Grange Farm's operating base was a static caravan, using water from a tap and hose, and said the staff portable toilet was covered in spider webs.
It said the interior of all five vehicles was ""visibly dirty"".
report noted Grange Farm had key services available seven days a week, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and enough staff to care for patients.
CQC's 12-week suspension of Grange Farm's registration, which covered patient transport and urgent and emergency care, ended last month and it said a second inspection took place on 29 November.
uspension continues until the CQC ""is assured the service can provide safe care"".
An Ikon Ambulance Services spokesman said: ""We acknowledge that the way in which we document and evidence our governance needed overhauling and have employed new reporting systems, new senior managers and new policies and procedures.
""These developments have enabled us to complete all the recommended actions within the report.""
kesman claimed the vehicles had returned from an equestrian event when they were inspected, and added: ""To deem a vehicle unclean without consideration for our business model is unfair and inaccurate.""
CQC said the company did not have an NHS contract at the time of the September inspection, but it started a contract in November with the James Paget University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust providing staffing support in its new ambulance handover unit - a service that was not subject to the suspension.
Great Yarmouth Borough Council confirmed it used Ikon to provide medical support at previous events, such as the 2022 Easter Fair, but had no ""ongoing agreement"".

In his new diaries on the pandemic, the MP says in January 2020 he was told by England's chief medical officer the toll was ""a reasonable case scenario""  if restrictions were not introduced.
Figures show more than 200,000 people with Covid have died in the UK to date.
government has set up an inquiry into its handling of the pandemic.
In his new book, Mr Hancock says that when he mentioned the projected death toll to other cabinet ministers, their reaction was ""somewhat 'shrug shrug' - essentially because they didn't really believe it"".
He wrote: ""I am constantly feeling that others, who aren't focused on this every day, are weeks behind what's going on.""
He said that 11 days later, England's chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty also warned transmission would be so high that ""almost everyone would catch it"".
Mr Hancock wrote: ""In his characteristically understated way, sitting at the back peeling a tangerine, Chris Whitty quietly informed everyone that in the reasonable worst-case scenario as many as 820,000 people in the UK may die.... The whole room froze. We are looking at a human catastrophe on a scale not seen here for a century.""
Mr Hancock's Pandemic Diaries: The Inside Story Of Britain's Battle Against Covid, is being serialised in the Daily Mail, with the West Suffolk MP set to donate all proceeds to NHS charities and causes supporting dyslexia.
first extract was published in the paper on Saturday and comes shortly after Mr Hancock reappeared in Westminster following his controversial appearance on ITV's reality show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.
Mr Hancock was criticised by MPs for his three-week stint in the jungle, where he placed third. 
He was suspended from the parliamentary Conservative Party after joining the show, and now sits as an independent MP.
In the book, the former health secretary also defended his handling of one of the most controversial episodes of the pandemic - the decision to release care home residents from hospital without testing, which was blamed for thousands of deaths.

health	Swindon woman warns over endometrial cancer signs	"A woman from Swindon is urging people to look out for the signs of endometrial cancer. 
Mo Squires had an unexpected bleed, 10 years after menopause and was diagnosed with grade three endometrial cancer.
Womb cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women in the UK and the most common of the five gynaecological cancers, more than 9,700 people are diagnosed each year in the UK.
Ms Squires said she had not felt ill making the diagnosis ""bizarre"".
She had a three-day post-menopausal bleed in July and after reporting it quickly to her GP surgery she was referred to the rapid gynae assessment unit.
After two biopsies Ms Squires was diagnosed with endometrial cancer commonly known as cancer of the womb.
Listen to Mo talking to Ben Prater on BBC Radio Wiltshire here
""I hadn't been feeling ill in fact I was feeling very well and to this day I'm still feeling very well so it's all a little bizarre,"" she said.
A former project manager, Ms Squires, admitted that her pragmatic approach was a gift in dealing with the diagnosis.
""It was just another project with a series of tasks and we tick them off as we go,"" she added.
Cancer of the womb is the most common cancer of the female genital tract and the forth most common cancer in women, Ms Keightley explained.
""It's both on the rise with the number of people being diagnosed but also unfortunately the number of people that are dying from this kind of cancer this is probably related to lifestyle factors particularly being more overweight,"" Ms Keightley said.
""If you have bleeding again after you've had no period for 12 months [menopause] it's really important that you go and see your GP. 
""It's also worth thinking about healthy lifestyle because particularly for this cancer it makes a really big difference both in terms of reducing your risk but also then what treatments we can offer you afterwards.""
Ms Squires had a CT scan two days after diagnosis that confirmed the cancer had not spread and she took the decision to have a full hysterectomy.
Ms Keightly explains this is not the lengthy process that people often fear.
""We do these operations now as key hole operations and that means the recovery is significantly quicker and people do a lot better after surgery generally.""
Ms Squires agreed.
""The difference between six weeks and 12 weeks for me I'd be going stir crazy if it were 12. I've got a concert on 10 December which will be seven-and-a-half weeks and I feel well enough to do that.""
And now with radiotherapy due to finish by Christmas the prognosis is good.
""I actually think I'm in a dream and I'm going to wake up and people are going to say that never happened because I didn't feel ill.
""I still don't feel ill and yet I clearly was so it's all a bit surreal. I'm forever grateful to my GP and everybody I've met ... my experience [treatment] has been world class.""

health	How Covid has dealt the NHS a lasting blow	"NHS in England has more funding and staff than before the pandemic - but in many types of care, it is treating fewer patients. Why? A leading think tank has tried to come up with some answers.
Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says this is a puzzle with no simple explanation - but the pandemic has dealt a lasting blow to the NHS and it could be costing more to treat patients, on average, than before.
Despite higher staff sickness rates, compared with pre-pandemic levels, the NHS has available to work:
But - not counting those filled by patients who have tested positive for Covid, even though they may be there mainly for something else -  there were 5% fewer beds available in the third quarter of this year than in 2019, the IFS says. The impact of the virus has lasted longer than expected. 
It is also harder to discharge medically fit patients because of problems with community care.  
And evidence, such as rising numbers of disability-benefit claimants, suggests there are more ill patients needing complex care.
monthly data shows 4% more GP appointments in England than in the same month in 2019, which is ""particularly striking"" as the number of fully qualified general practitioners has fallen, the IFS says.
re were also more first cancer hospital outpatient appointments - but fewer overall and the number of patients treated from the waiting list, currently 7.2 million in England, was down 11%.
f NHS finances has been well documented and the report says the real value of the current spending plans has been reduced by inflation.
IFS research economist Max Warner says: ""The NHS is showing clear signs of strain heading into the winter and is treating fewer patients than it was pre-pandemic, across many types of care. 
""The real risk, almost three years on from the start of the pandemic, is that the Covid hit to NHS performance is not time-limited. 
""Going forward, we need to grapple with the possibility that the health service is just able to treat fewer patients with the same level of resources.""
A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""As the IFS report acknowledges, Covid had a significant impact on the NHS, and we are focused on delivering the biggest catch-up programme in health history"".
NHS had reduced waits of 18 months by 60% in a year and ""virtually eliminated"" waits of more than two years.
""We're allocating an extra £500 million to speed up hospital discharge, getting ambulances back on the road more quickly, and increasing the number of NHS call handlers.""

health	Antibiotics for strep A in good supply, says health secretary Steve Barclay	"re are good supplies of antibiotics to treat strep A and stock can be moved around if there are issues in some areas, Health Secretary Steve Barclay has told the BBC.
But pharmacies are worried about patchy supply caused by rising demand for penicillin and amoxicillin.
medicines are used to treat cases of strep A and scarlet fever, which are higher than usual around the UK.
Nine children have died with rare but severe bacterial strep A infections.
Health experts say parents and doctors need to be vigilant and alert to the symptoms of infection.
GPs have been advised to prescribe antibiotics for children who may have worsening symptoms linked to strep A.
Strep A can look like a number of different conditions, and is mild in most cases, causing a sore throat or skin infection which is easily treated with antibiotics.
But it can develop into scarlet fever and, very rarely, into invasive group-A streptococcal infection (iGAS) which can be extremely serious. 
Schools with a number of cases of strep A or scarlet fever could be given antibiotics to hand out to pupils in order to prevent further spread of the bacteria.
rompting concern from pharmacists in England and also in Wales that stock of antibiotics could run low unless there is some planning around supply.
Mr Barclay told BBC Breakfast: ""We have very regular contact with the medical suppliers, and the manufacturers have said they don't have concern in terms of supply at the moment.
""It is always the case that if you have a particular surge in one or two GPs then the response suppliers look at warehouse depots and how they move their stock around.
""What the suppliers have said to us is they do have good levels of supply, and that is not a concern at the moment, and where there are particular issues with GPs, then they will move stock around accordingly.""
Martin Sawer, chief executive of the Healthcare Distribution Association (HDA), the trade body which represents drug wholesalers, said the UK could be in for a ""bumpy ride"" over the coming days.
He told the BBC that pharmacists and wholesalers had been ""caught by surprise"" by health advice issued to doctors to lower the threshold for prescribing antibiotics. It had led to over ordering by pharmacists resulting in ""extreme demand"", he said.
""The minister is right, there isn't a shortage, but the medicine is in the wrong place,"" Mr Sawer said.
""It's at the manufacturers and there are difficulties getting it from them to the wholesalers.""
He added: ""If I have one message... it's that someone needs to send a strong message out about not stockpiling. The government needs to take the lead and give out stronger messaging about not over ordering as everyone in the supply chain needs that reassurance.""
Earlier, the National Pharmacy Association (NPA) said pharmacies were having to ""work very hard to obtain stocks of these antibiotics and some lines are unavailable"".
It said there had been a spike in demand for some antibiotics, including those used to treat strep A in children.
""We have been advised by wholesalers that most lines will be replenished soon, but we cannot say exactly when that will be,"" the NPA said.
Pharmacists said they would work with local GPs to help people get the medicines they need as quickly as possible, but that could require a change of prescription.
Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, which represents 4,000 pharmacies, said the supply of antibiotic medicines in oral liquid form (for children) from wholesalers was ""patchy"".
It said pharmacies were experiencing supply issues from all wholesalers, and it puts this down to a big rise in the number of prescriptions for antibiotics.

Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn has already had to close four of its seven operating theatres because of concerns the ceiling could collapse.
Alex Stewart, head of Healthwatch Norfolk, said some pregnant women have asked to go to other hospitals.
rust is hoping it will be one of eight in England to get a new hospital. 
Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) opened in 1980, one of seven hospitals built using a material called reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC).
material has serious weaknesses and is deteriorating, with uncertainty over its structural integrity leading to more than £100m being spent this financial year on safety measures across the affected sites.
Mr Stewart told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think people are very frustrated, they're well aware that the hospital staff inspect the hospital on a daily basis, several times a day.
""That said, we are aware of patients, for example, who are giving birth, who have asked to go to other hospitals because they're scared in case the roof might fall in on them. 
""So there's a perception that is perhaps unrealistic, but it's there all the same."" 
's interim chief executive, Alice Webster, said while four theatres have had to be closed, ""potentially"" there could be problems with the ceilings in the others.
""We continue to monitor it on a daily basis,"" she said.
""We're making sure our theatres are functioning longer, we're functioning at weekends and trying to manage the waiting lists that way."" 
She added: ""If we don't get a new hospital we will have to review all the services that we currently provide, but we won't be able to provide all the services that we currently do.""
In 2020, the government announced 40 hospitals would be built by 2030 as part of a package worth £3.7bn, with a further eight schemes invited to bid for future funding.
rust is waiting to hear if it will be one of those eight across England chosen to get a new hospital.
In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care, said ""We are committed to delivering 40 new hospitals by 2030, backed by an initial £3.7bn, which will be the biggest hospital building programme in a generation, and ensure a stronger future for the NHS and we will identify a further eight new hospital schemes - the process for which is ongoing with a final decision announced later this year.""

health	Birmingham Children's Hospital warns of long A&E waits	"A children's hospital trust says it is under ""significant, sustained pressure"" due to high levels of respiratory infections.
Birmingham Women and Children's trust said it had seen an ""unprecedented"" rise in patients in the emergency department at its children's hospital.
A number of units were also reporting a lack of beds for admissions, it said.
Letters are being sent via Birmingham schools to parents and carers in a hope it will help ease pressure.
Nationally, parents are being urged to get their children a flu vaccine after a 70% jump in hospital admissions of patients under five. 
In its letter, the Birmingham NHS trust said: ""The children's hospital emergency department is incredibly busy - those who are not seriously ill will face very long waits to be seen and may need to go elsewhere for help.
""Remember, the children's hospital emergency department can't help with dental or eye issues. For an eye emergency, please attend the Midland Eye Centre at Dudley Road.""
Dr Fiona Reynolds, chief medical officer at the trust, said: ""Our emergency department has been under significant pressure due to high levels of respiratory infections locally and unprecedented attendances.
""The trust has been asking everyone to help by sharing some key advice to children, parents and carers to ease the pressure on staff who are working incredibly hard.""

health	Search for replacement GP service for Highley	"A Shropshire GP practice is set to hand back its NHS contract, prompting fears the village could lose the surgery.
Highley Medical Centre, near Bridgnorth, was put in special measures after a damning report by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in January.
NHS Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, which commissions GP services, said it was told on Tuesday of the operators' decision to pull out.
NHS said its aim was to keep a GP surgery in Highley.
rator has agreed to stay on until 31 March and commissioners said ""extensive work"" was being carried out to find a ""sustainable solution"".
""Our work will prioritise access to General Practice services for those people affected by this announcement and try to secure an option which remains in Highley,"" Claire Parker, Director of Partnerships and Place at NHS Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, said. 
CQC report in January followed an inspection in November 2021.
It had slipped from an overall ""good"" rating in 2016, under a different operator, to ""inadequate"".
At the time, inspectors particularly raised concerns about safeguarding procedures, training, blood test monitoring and the organisation of medicines and equipment in the event of a medical emergency.

health	Nurses' strike: The young NHS workers who voted yes	"Nurses at some NHS trusts are expected to walk out later this year after voting in favour of striking.
Unions have said even new recruits were struggling to see a future in the NHS, with nurses struggling with workloads and rising prices not matching wages.
It will be the first UK-wide action by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in more than 100 years.
re's been criticism from some, with the government in England urging nurses to consider the impact on patients.
It will be a different picture across the UK - in England the turnout was too low in nearly half of trusts for action to take place.
But, nurses in every service in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted for action, and in Wales all but one health board did.
Student nurse Ellie McNicol only started her course at the University of Bristol last year but says she has already seen enough to know things need to change.
""Lots of mistakes are happening that shouldn't be due to staffing pressures,"" the 22-year-old told BBC Newsbeat.
""I've seen it firsthand. We get a lot of pressure put on us.""
Ellie was inspired to get into nursing after caring for her brother when he was in an accident a couple of years ago.
""If I didn't feel so strongly about wanting to help people I'd consider dropping out,"" Ellie says.
""I knew it was going to be hard. It's common knowledge that nurses don't get half of what they deserve.""
As a student, she doesn't get paid for her time working on wards but receives a bursary to help with her travel costs. 
walkout will involve Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members in more than half of hospitals and community teams, but emergency care will still be staffed.
government in England pointed out it had given a pay rise in line with what had been recommended by the independent NHS Pay Review body.
England Health Secretary Steve Barclay said he ""deeply regretted"" that some union members had voted for action, adding the ""priority is keeping patients safe during any strikes"".
Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health managers, urged the government and RCN to get back to the negotiating table.
""The last thing anyone wants is a 'war of attrition' playing out over many months.""
Ellie understands the concerns, but says: ""If nurses feel like their only option is to strike, it must be something really big.
""When it's Royal Mail, it's just people's post, not their lives on the line,"" she says. 
With the cost of living increasing, she argues nurses have to look after themselves as much as they look after others.
Paediatric nurse Jessie Collins works in schools and A&E and also voted in favour of strike action.
""It's about creating a work culture that retains staff,"" she says. 
""As nurses, it's really hard not to be able to deliver the care you want to.""
29-year-old says the strikes are also to ""highlight the fact we aren't paid in line with what we think we're worth and the profession is worth"".
""And it's about trying to make it a better place, not just for us, but for our patients as well."" 
She describes being a nurse as ""really rewarding"", but says the job ""has to be a place that is safe"".
""There is a massive staffing crisis. In the long-term, it's going to be quite catastrophic, unless they do something,"" she says.
And she feels the short-term impact of striking has ""nothing on the impact on patient care over the past few years"".
""It's not something we ever imagined we would do. And it's for the benefit of our patients in the long run.""
Luke, who works in Wales, says he voted to strike after six years in the job.
""The volume of work and the level of responsibility is unbelievable for the money you're on,"" says Luke, who didn't want to share his full name.
He's seen his outgoings shoot up by £400 a month, and says he's having to pick up extra weekend shifts to make ends meet. 
""How is frozen pay going to help me deal with that?"" he asks. ""My job is now unaffordable.""
Although high numbers of nurses are choosing to leave the profession, Luke says he is so passionate about his career he would not consider quitting.
""None of us are in this for the money,"" he says. ""This is not a career you go in to to get rich.
""It's not just a job you do - you give a piece of yourself to it.""
Choosing to strike was a ""preventative measure"", he says, adding the quality of care was already slipping.
""It really is life and death,"" he says. 
""Patients are already suffering because we're struggling to give them the care they need and deserve.""
xact information for when strike action will occur has not yet been announced.

Chae Jenkins, 23, who uses a wheelchair to get around since his diagnosis three years ago, scored a try after being carried over the line by both teams.
More than 500 spectators turned out at Launceston Rugby Club to cheer on Mr Jenkins who was forced to retire from the sport in February 2020.
former prop took part in a charity match in aid of Brain Tumour Research.
ugural rugby match on Boxing Day between a Chae XV and Launceston XV raised more than £4,500 for the charity.
Mr Jenkins, from Bude, was diagnosed with a tumour after suffering with migraines in January 2020, when he was aged 20.
He received radiotherapy and chemotherapy and continues to be monitored with regular scans. 
umour left him with life-changing injuries including impaired vision and limited mobility.
Mr Jenkins played for the Launceston first team, Exeter Chiefs Academy and Cornwall under 20s before the diagnosis.
""It was emotional to be back on the field,"" said Mr Jenkins who was greeted by a huge roar of cheers from the crowd.
""Both squads came together to help me score a try in the same place I scored last time I played.
""Although I know I will never play rugby again, it was great to be carried with members of both teams and lace up my boots for the first time since I was diagnosed with a brain tumour.""

health	Nottingham maternity units set to miss investigations deadline	"Bosses at Nottingham's crisis-hit maternity units are set to miss a deadline for clearing a backlog of incomplete ""serious incident"" investigations.
Nottingham University Hospitals Trust (NUH) has 53 outstanding maternity incidents yet to be investigated.
rust had said it aimed to complete investigations by December 23.
But director of midwifery Sharon Wallis says they have not progressed as quickly as she had hoped.
""Serious incidents"" are unexpected or unintended events that could cause NHS patients harm.
Local Democracy Reporting Service said the trust has managed to clear a number of those incidents - but it declared another nine in September and October.
Maternity services at the trust, which runs the Queen's Medical Centre and City Hospital, have been rated 'inadequate' by health watchdogs.
An independent review team, led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden, is examining dozens of baby deaths at the the trust.
Ms Wallis told a November board meeting the investigation work was NUH's ""absolute focus"".
She said: ""Our burning platform at the minute is our serious incidents.
""We have 53 serious incidents. Nine have been identified since September and October - this leaves us with 44 in the backlog.
""I am taking personal responsibility on this and we are absolutely driving that forward. It's not where we wanted to be or predicted to be.""
Ms Wallis added she now hoped the trust will have 19 or 20 outstanding investigations remaining by the new year.
NUH has lowered the threshold for what is classed as a ""serious incident"", which has increased the number being declared.
review was set up by the government following a campaign by bereaved families.
More than 700 families and 160 members of staff have shared their experiences since Ms Ockenden's independent review team started work in September.

health	Agency nurses: How will NI cut its dependence on private firms?	"""Staff retention is nearly impossible... if we can't retain staff, how do you look after patients?""
Linda Smyth has been an NHS nurse for more than three decades but in recent years she has witnessed an exodus of staff towards private nursing agencies.
Nursing agencies often advertise much higher rates of pay and flexible, family-friendly hours.
Ms Smyth accepts temporary staff will always be needed to provide cover. 
But she is concerned that heavy reliance on agency nurses could affect patient welfare, as well as demoralising NHS staff working alongside them for less money.
ring of agency nurses cost Stormont's Department of Health almost £140m in the last financial year alone.
But in October, a crackdown on agency spending was announced, including a plan for a new system which will cap agency pay rates by February 2023.
Nursing unions have long argued public money should be used to improve pay and conditions of NHS nurses rather than being paid to private firms.
""We've all worked with an agency nurse that's less experienced but on more money,"" Ms Smyth told BBC News NI.
She is currently based in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) and said the current NHS overtime system cannot compete with agency fees. 
""Nurses are leaving their staff posts and going to work for an agency... if someone was waving two bags of money under your nose, you would go as well.""
Ms Smyth said NHS nurses were often grateful to have another pair of hands on busy wards, but admitted they were ""resentful of the difference in the pay"".
""They are all good nurses,"" she said.
""But they are there for a day and then they are gone.
""They don't get to know the patients. For example: 'There's John and he likes this.'  They don't have continuation of care every day.""
week, BBC News NI reported on pressures in Northern Ireland's emergency departments and was advised that about 40% of emergency department shifts in the RVH were filled by agency staff. 
Despite attractive pay offers, Ms Smyth said she ""loves"" her job and is not tempted to go to an agency.
""I'll stay with the trust,"" she said, ""because I believe in the NHS"".
But she argues private firms are reaping the rewards of years of NHS investment in nursing skills.
""We train them, we mould them - then they leave and go to agencies. If we had a better rate of pay these agencies wouldn't have the grip they do on the health trusts,"" she said. 
""I'm no way saying they should pay the amount agencies are paying - we know there's no pot of gold here - but there should be a level playing field.""
In October, Stormont's then-Health Minister Robin Swann acknowledged ""overreliance"" on agencies was having a negative impact on the NHS workforce and ""putting additional pressures on them to support agency staff who are unfamiliar with systems and wards"".
Just weeks before he left office, he set out a major plan to reform the system with the aim of substantially reducing expenditure on agency nurses.
re are three ways in which health trusts hire nurses to fill gaps in NHS rotas.
In October, the Department of Health revealed spending on off-contract agencies had almost quadrupled from pre-pandemic levels - rising from £27m in 2018/19 to £101m in the last financial year.
f on-contract agencies was much lower, totalling £38.4m in 2021/22.
At the time, Mr Swann announced a plan to ""eliminate"" off-contract spending, telling agencies they could ""work with us on a contractual footing - or face an end to their income from the health service"". 
One off-contract agency currently advertises a basic rate of £31 per hour for a registered nurse covering a weekday shift in Northern Ireland.
However, its pay rates rise to £98.50 per hour for a very senior nurse, in charge of a specialist unit like high dependency, if they work on a bank holiday.
gency concerned is believed to be one of the more expensive providers, but last year it supplied nurses to four of Northern Ireland's five health trusts. 
Department of Health is introducing a new system which will limit the amount of money health trusts can pay agencies to hire casual workers.
During the tendering process, the department is asking agencies to bid with their charge rate which should reflect the ""total cost per hour to the trust for the service"". 
""The total hourly charge rate bid must be within the capped limits and is to include worker's pay and all other financial obligations in relation to the employment of the agency worker,"" its spokesperson said.
union Unison supports the crackdown on agency spending but said it must be accompanied by NHS overtime pay rises and reforms in order to attract nurses to work anti-social hours.
Conor McCarthy from Unison said the reliance on agency staff over the past few years had ""led to a very disillusioned workforce"" and was ""essentially privatising nursing from within"".
""Some of them are very good, don't get me wrong,"" he said. 
""But there's a lot of agency staff that are just newly-qualified nurses who have chosen agencies as their substantive employer.
""As a result they're not as qualified as a lot of the more experienced staff with a high set of skills.""
Mr McCarthy said younger, less-experienced agency nurses were often used to fill shifts during weekends and holidays which was not beneficial for patients.
But he also acknowledged that many experienced nurses now have ""dual membership of both the NHS and agencies"" because of private firms' higher pay rates.
""I see [NHS] nurses I know very well in the morning and then I see them in evening with an nursing agency uniform on,"" he said.
Unions have lobbied for the creation of a centralised ""regional bank"" system where all five health trusts can hire NHS staff for extra shifts, on improved overtime rates.
""It's safer for the patient and if nurses can also avail of an enhanced rate within that bank, then they'd be more than happy, Mr McCarthy said.
""And I do think it's definitely a game changer in reducing the cost in the health service of agencies and it's also, I believe, a game changer by way of enhancing recruitment and retention.""
Department of Health said it recognised reform of the trusts' banks was ""necessary to support the move away from agency usage"" and that a new regional nursing bank is among measures under consideration."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63905512
health	Scarlet fever case numbers on the rise in Northern Ireland	"Scarlet fever is usually a mild illness but can cause serious consequences, says Dr Joanne McClean
umber of cases of scarlet fever in Northern Ireland has risen in the past couple of weeks.
Public Health Agency is alerting parents to the symptoms in children, including a pin-prick rash on the skin.
Speaking to BBC News NI, Dr Joanne McClean from the PHA said clusters of cases had been identified and health officials were monitoring numbers.
Parents are also being urged by the agency to vaccinate young children against the flu.
Pre-school children aged two years and over are eligible to receive the free flu jab through their GP.
Australia has just experienced one of its worst flu seasons.
us of the flu season in Australia often serves as a predictor for the northern hemisphere.
Dr McClean said scarlet fever was ""usually mild illness"" but those who have it can ""develop serious consequences in the short and long term"".
She said: ""It starts off with the child being a bit unwell - maybe a temperature, sore throat, out of sorts - but they go on to develop quite a characteristic rash.
""It's a pin-prick rash, which feels a bit rough to touch.""
It is an infectious condition and has been spreading within schools, said Dr McClean.
""We have seen some clusters of scarlet fever in schools across Northern Ireland this year,"" she said.
""We're keeping track of the cases that are reported and supporting schools and other organisations as required.
""The numbers of scarlet fever were really, really low in the last two years and then it has bounced back this year.

health	Health staff in Unison and Nispa to take industrial action	"Healthcare staff who are members of two of Northern Ireland's biggest unions will begin industrial action on 5 December as part of a dispute over pay.
move by the Unison and Nipsa unions follows an announcement by the Royal College of Nursing that its members will strike on 15 and 20 December.
Unison said the cost-of-living crisis was ""biting deep"" and it was ""foolish"" to assume workers would ""suck it up"".
Nipsa said the action was ""likely to be the strongest ever"" by health staff.
A spokesman for Stormont's Department of Health said health authorities would work to protect critical services as much as possible during the industrial action but warned there would ""inevitably be an impact on patient care"".
Unison members will take action short of strike on 5 December before a one-day strike on 12 December.
Nipsa members will begin ""indefinite action short of strike"" on 5 December.
Patricia McKeown, Unison's Northern Ireland regional secretary, said action short of strike meant health staff would only work the hours they were contracted to do.
""There are thousands of free hours given by health workers to the system every week,"" she said.
""People do much more than they are paid to do and we are asking them to stop that.
""They will stop covering for free all the jobs of the people that are currently missing from the system - they will get on with their job.
""Those thousands of free hours that will be missing from the system will have an impact.""
Nipsa deputy secretary general Padraig Mulholland said the health service had reached a ""tipping point"". 
""What may appear to be sort of the norm in other jobs is not the norm in the health service and it's an extraordinary state of affairs where people can't even eat their lunch,"" he added.
Health workers in Northern Ireland have yet to receive an increase in pay for the 2022-23 financial year.
In July an independent pay review body recommended that they should receive a rise of £1,400.
In England and Wales, NHS staff have been given a rise of at least £1,400.
Unions in Scotland are considering a government offer averaging 7.5% that was made last week.
Ms McKeown said health workers in Northern Ireland did not want to take strike action but felt they had no other option.
She said Unison hoped Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris would intervene to solve the pay dispute.
Nipsa said 92% of its members who took part in a ballot voted for strike action and 97% supported action short of strike.
Its members are taking the action on three fronts - pay, travel reimbursement and staffing levels within the health service.
union said the safety of patients ""remains a priority"" and it was having discussions with health service employers in order to ""take the necessary steps to protect patients during the dispute"".
""We'll be engaging with management to ensure that life and limb of the patient is not put at risk by any action that is being taken,"" Mr Mulholland said.
In a statement, a Department of Health spokesman said Northern Ireland's health and social care system was ""planning for a very difficult winter period"".
""The Department of Health shares the frustration of Northern Ireland health care staff at the absence to date of a pay award for this year.
""We greatly value our health care staff and very much regret that so many of them believe industrial action is necessary,"" the statement said. 
""In the event of strike action, the department and health and social care trusts will work closely with trade unions with a view to protecting critical services as much as possible.
""However, there will inevitably be an impact on patient care, and further impairment of already highly-pressurised services,"" it added.

health	Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?	"What can statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?
Here we update some of the key weekly and monthly data for measuring the pandemic and also assess some of the key Covid-19 indicators over the past two years.
We are now at a ""Covid stable"" stage of the pandemic, but a watch is still being kept on infection estimates and the numbers of people being admitted to hospital and deaths as we head towards the winter.
One in 55 people - 55,900 - were estimated to have had Covid in the past week, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
1.84% of the population - more than the 43,400 estimated in the previous week.
It follows six successive weeks of falling infections and a week when the trend was uncertain.
Since summer 2020, the ONS has organised a weekly nose and throat swab survey involving thousands of households across Wales, which now sees people being sent test kits by post.
It has become the most important tool to measure the level of infections, with the end of mass testing at the end of March.
Infections are estimated to be rising in England and Scotland and uncertain in Northern Ireland.
mates are that one in 50 people in England and Scotland and one in 45 in Northern Ireland have the virus.
Wales is estimated to have a fewer proportion of people with Covid than any other UK nation and all English regions, apart from the West Midlands and East Midlands.
mates show infections are highest in people in their early 30s. ONS says infections have decreased in those aged about 60 years and over in recent weeks and the trend was uncertain in younger adults and children.
umber of hospital patients testing positive for Covid by 13 December has risen in the past week - the highest point in more than a month and higher than the same point in the winter season a year ago. 
Few patients testing positive are being ""actively"" treated for Covid although these numbers have started to rise a little.
We know about 88% of people are currently being treated primarily for other conditions and happen to test positive while in hospital or on admission. 
umber of patients testing positive for Covid in hospital beds in Wales averaged 341 a day in the week to 13 December - up by more than a third on the week before.
Of these, there were an average of 299 in acute beds, compared with 219 the week before, so a rise of 37%.
majority continue to be ""incidental"" Covid patients, who happen to test positive in hospital, although the proportion has risen in the last week.
Only 59 (15%) of confirmed Covid patients in acute beds on 13 December were being primarily treated for the virus, with 323 patients in hospital being treated for other conditions.
When we include patients with suspected Covid and those recovering, there were 596 people on average in hospital beds over the past week - 15% up on the week before. They make up 6.7% of all hospital patients.
re were an average of 232 patients recovering in the week ending 13 December, so they were no longer testing positive for Covid but were  waiting for discharge or for a care package to become available.
ressures on hospitals.
Numbers in critical care with Covid are averaging 12 a day, roughly the same as we have seen for the past two months but slightly up on the week.
re are 14 times more non-Covid patients in critical care than patients with the virus.   
In April, there were 27 Covid patients in critical care, peaking at 38 in January, while in the second wave it peaked at 150 patients.
mortality rate of critical care Covid patients, in the most recent study of 286 Welsh patients since January 2022, was about 32.9%, including those who died later on a general ward.
About 69% had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic. 
rage age of those admitted so far in 2022 is 58, just over half are men and they are likely to be overweight. More than half are from more deprived parts of Wales. About 29% were under 50.
udy, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December 2021.
Numbers of admissions of people testing positive for Covid are averaging 11 a day, a similar number to November.
Covid-positive patients only make up 1.1% of all admissions.
About 12% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or ""actively"" treated for the virus on average in the past week. 
rage number has been 35 in the most recent week, compared to 18 in the previous week.
It does not mean these patients cannot have complications because of Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.
Broken down by health board, Cardiff and Vale, Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Swansea Bay recorded notable numbers of patients testing positive who were being treated ""actively"" for Covid in the past week.
re has been a higher proportion of patients with Covid being treated primarily for the virus in critical care - and that was 11 out of 14 acute patients on 13 December.
Icnarc intensive care study has found a far smaller proportion of critical care patients with Covid were being primarily treated for the virus after January 2022 (27%), compared to the period before (nearly 86%).
figures on ""incidental"" Covid cases have only been published in recent months.
Digital Health and Care Wales indicated the data had no standard definition for ""actively being treated for Covid"", meaning there were some differences between health boards in how they arrived at the figure.
Patients who are asymptomatic are no longer being tested routinely.
re were 309 positive tests for Covid in hospitals in the week ending 11 December, the most since the end of October.
Public Health Wales figures show in the latest week,  ""probably"" or ""definitely"" hospital-acquired cases in patients outnumber those community-acquired or indeterminate Covid cases. 
Hospital-acquired infections stood at 189, double the previous week.
re have been about 16,840 hospital-acquired infections recorded since the start of the pandemic.
An indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which hit a high of 95% in the week ending 26 October.
It has slipped back slightly in the last month to 93.6%.
We know also that recent modelling from Welsh government scientists suggests in a ""worst case"" scenario that Covid, flu and other respiratory conditions could account for 2,750 hospital beds - or 28% of total capacity at the winter peak in 2022-23.
""most likely"" scenario had been for 1,390 patients with Covid, flu and other respiratory conditions on 9 December, including 668 with confirmed positive tests for Covid.
Currently, figures for hospital bed occupancy across respiratory conditions shows around 580 patients with flu, RSV or Covid in the week ending 11 December.
ge ranges for flu patients was fairly evenly split with two thirds under 65 in the latest week. 
Just under half of RSV hospitalisations were the over 65s but 41% were in under fours, reflecting the high intensity of cases in children in the community.
Modelling for Covid alone peaked at more than 1,800 patients with the virus in a ""worst case scenario"" in December.
But the actual curve for patients with Covid positive tests has fallen even below the ""most likely"" scenario and was closer to the ""optimistic"" scenario after being above the predicted levels until early November.
Scientific advisers with a more up to date projection at the end of November suggested hospital bed occupancy with Covid would continue to decline to December and reach a plateau in the following weeks. A slight increase in Covid admissions was projected towards the end of January and February.
Another measure of pressure on the health service is NHS staff absence.
A total of 0.8% of staff - about 861 - were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 12 December. Another 0.2% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the bi-monthly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. 
6.3%, a little higher than the usual pre-pandemic figure of about 5%.
quarterly average to June was 6.6%, down from 7.2% in the three months to March, which was the second highest rate on record.
fection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests 95.9% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.
All UK nations are close to or at 96%-97%.
mate is 98% of 16 to 24-year-olds in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 92.4% for those aged 60 to 64. 
At the higher threshold, 73.4% of adults in Wales are at or above 800 nanograms per millilitre and well over 77.6% in those aged 16 to 24 and 91.6% of the 75-79 age group.
As part of its weekly swab survey, involving many thousands of people across the UK, some participants also have their level of antibodies checked in a blood test and are also asked a series of other questions towards fact-finding about Covid.
Scientific advisers to the Welsh government said 0.6% of people aged 12 and over were estimated to be at risk of going to hospital with Covid at the start of April 2022, compared with 9.3% two years before, at the start of the pandemic.
And for those at-risk groups, 6% were estimated to be at risk of needing hospital treatment and 7% of the over 60s.
ks to vaccination and natural protection from immunity after having infection.
rate at which GPs are consulted about Covid-19 is also another indicator, which peaked in the first week of January 2022 at 98 consultations per 100,000 and has now fallen back to around two per 100,000. 
-called R-number - the reproduction number - has been a tool to express the infection rate of Covid.
Expressed within a range, if it's above 1, this indicates that infections are growing. 
range remains between 0.8 and 1, suggesting infections are falling. So, for every 10 people with Covid in Wales, between another eight and 10 people would be infected.
umber of people who have died when Covid was a contributory factor has reached 11,128 in Wales, for registrations so far.
In the most recent week, up to 2 December, 17 people in Wales had a death registered which involved Covid-19 and saw it included as a contributory factor on their death certificate, according to the ONS.
milar number to the previous week.
re were no Covid deaths in 14 local authorities, including across the Hywel Dda health board area in mid and west Wales for the first week since August last year.
re were five deaths in Swansea - four of these involved care home residents - and three in Neath Port Talbot.
re were three deaths also in Cardiff, two in Caerphilly and others in Anglesey, Bridgend, Torfaen and Wrexham.
When counted by day occurring - not day registered - there were 16 deaths involving Covid in the past week registered so far, compared to 13 in the previous week.
However, the most recent weekly figures are usually an underestimate, due to delays in registrations catching up.
Up to 2 December, a total of 11,094 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales.
ONS says that up to the end of October, of deaths registered so far, there have been 9,199 deaths due to Covid, with the virus the underlying cause of death.
Deaths involving Covid are running lower than at the same point in 2021, with the total number of deaths involving Covid 46% of what we saw up to 2 December in 2021.
re were 27 deaths between 18-19 July 2022, the most since January. This was at the height of the summer heatwave.
Omicron wave from December 2021 brought a peak in deaths of 20 on 15 January 2022, the same level as the peaks in deaths in September and October.
ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.
During 2021, there were 4,029 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.
udes 209 deaths in December 2021. In December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.
wave in the winter brought 83 deaths on 11 January 2021 alone - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.
ONS also records so-called ""excess deaths"". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared with the five-year, non-pandemic average.
So since March 2020, there have been 8,285 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.
udes nearly 1,290 excess deaths in 2022 so far.
re have been 1,167 deaths from all causes above the non-pandemic average since July with 481 of them not involving Covid (41%).
Deaths have been above the five-year pre-pandemic norm for all but two of the last 26 weeks.
re were 730 deaths from all causes - this is 59 more (8.8%) than the average in the most recent week. 
Covid accounted for 2.3% of all deaths in Wales in the latest week, less than the proportion in England (2.8%).
Across England and Wales, in nearly two thirds (61.8%) of deaths with Covid mentioned on the death certificate, it was also the underlying cause of death in the latest week.
Nearly a fifth (18.2%) of all Covid deaths registered have occurred in care homes.
re were five deaths involving Covid involving a care home resident registered in the latest week - out of 128 deaths overall.
Care Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,251 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid since the pandemic began.
It had been notified of four deaths involving Covid during November.
ONS analysis of deaths in care homes in 2021 found mortality rates lower in Wales in men than in England or any English region.
Covid was the second highest cause of death in care home residents after dementia, accounting for 12.9% of male resident deaths and 11.1% of female resident deaths.
Covid-19 was the seventh leading cause of death in Wales in October, after being the 10th leading cause in September.
Mortality analysis by the ONS showed deaths due to Covid - 103 in total occurred over the month - accounted for 3.5% of all registered deaths. It was 3.3% of all deaths in England in October.
Looking at when Covid was a contributory factor, there were 147 deaths involving Covid in Wales - or 4.9% of all deaths registered in October.
Dementia was the leading cause of death in September in Wales for the third month in succession. 
Flu and pneumonia again ranked sixth, ahead of Covid, with its mortality rate for a second month in succession.
mortality rate for symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions was significantly higher (58.3%) than the five-year average, according to ONS.
Covid, which was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021, is now the sixth leading cause of death so far in 2022, after heart disease, dementia, chronic lower respiratory diseases, lung and throat cancers and strokes.
It is significantly lower than the five leading causes of death.
Flu and pneumonia is still ranked seventh so far in 2022.
ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in October was 34.6 deaths per 100,000 - an increase on September's figure. 
Across the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is about the same in Wales (120 deaths per 100,000), as England on 119.7 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (111) and Northern Ireland (110.8) both lower in the 32 months to the end of October.
ge-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England than in Wales.
It is also higher in all English regions apart from south west, south east and east England.
When a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales.
ONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 70.1% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales in October. 
It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic, 83.7% of deaths with Covid on death certificates can be said to be due to Covid since the pandemic began.
So, there were 9,199 deaths due to Covid by the end of October in Wales, 54% of them male.
In about 4% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was ""suspected"".
A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. 
Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.
By 2 December, RCT had reached a total of 1,143 deaths and also had the eighth highest crude mortality rate (480.9 deaths per 100,000) of all local authorities across England and Wales.
Merthyr Tydfil (476.2 deaths per 100,000) was the ninth highest and Bridgend 15th (459.1 deaths per 100,000).
RCT has overtaken Cardiff (1,137) for the most deaths in Wales up to 2 December.
Six of RCT's communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates can be broken down further.
At a health board level, the age-standardised mortality rate for Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which covers RCT, Merthyr and Bridgend, was 153.3 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the pandemic up to the end of October 2022. 
ghest in Wales, the lowest being 63.9 deaths due to Covid in the Powys health board area, set against a Welsh average of 100.4.
mmunity with the highest number of Covid deaths across 2020 and 2021, including in the first two waves of the pandemic, was Tonyrefail West, with a total of 63 deaths due to Covid.
was followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot and Porth East and Ynyshir in Rhondda Cynon Taf (55 deaths each), by the end of 2021.
When translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Gwersyllt West and Summerhill in Wrexham was the highest at 742.6 deaths per 100,000 - or 44 deaths over the two years.
was followed by Tonyrefail West, Port Talbot East and Llanelli Bigyn in Carmarthenshire.
All communities of Wales have now had at least two deaths during the pandemic.
west number of deaths at a community level were in Aberystwyth North and Aberystwyth South, Bangor City and Llandudno Junction South and Llasanffraid Glan Conwy.
At a local authority level, in the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.
In 2021, Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate - 271 deaths or 183.2 deaths per 100,000; this was the 24th highest area across England and Wales.
ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way so do not expect to see the same thing:
fferent measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales
Public Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:
graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.
re is a difference of about 3,000 deaths.
According to the PHW measure, by 14 December there had been a total of 8,081 deaths with Covid, with 13 deaths being reported in the most recent week.
PHW has now switched to only weekly reporting.
We do not know how many of these people have died of Covid, only that they tested positive in the weeks before they died.
With the large number of ""incidental"" Covid cases in hospital during the Omicron wave, it is a less reliable measure to use day to day.
More than 8.5m doses of vaccine have been administered in Wales since December 2020.
majority in the last week have been autumn boosters, with the programme running at around 5,000 a day, a drop on recent weeks.
So far, more than a million autumn boosters have been given out, reaching more than 86% of care home residents and nearly 79% of over 65s. 
More than half of those aged 50 to 64 have also had autumn boosters.
Wales has reached proportionately more of key groups with autumn boosters than England, although fewer than Scotland so far.
re are also fewer of the key groups reached than the earlier phases of the programme.
rs were reaching fewer elderly people from black and ethnic minorities, with the gap widest in the over 80s - just 40% compared to 54% of white over 80s by early October.
Ceredigion had reached fewest of the over 65s but still over 68% and Vale of Glamorgan had reached the most (86.4%).
Monmouthshire has reached the most in the 50s to 64 age group (67.6%) with Torfaen the fewest (33%).
revious booster campaign saw 85% of those eligible being given a dose.
Public Health Wales is now only reporting Covid vaccination figures weekly.
Meanwhile, 69% of the over 65s have so far had a flu vaccine - the same time as this time last year. Fewer two and three year olds have had the vaccine since this time last year.
minant variant in Wales has been Omicron in 2022, and 1,030 new cases have been sequenced in the last month.
Because of the ending of mass testing in April, we should not expect to see the same numbers of results going off for sequencing any more.
So far, 29,222 cases of a sub-variant of Omicron, BA.2, have been recorded in Wales but very few cases in recent months.
It overtook the ""original"" Omicron in all areas of Wales but this sub-variant itself has been overtaken by other sub-variants, especially BA.5.
re have been 88 cases of the new sub-variant BQ.1 again in the last week - related to the BA.5 strain.
Infection estimates by ONS suggest BA.5 overtook the BA.1 strain in early March, while the following BA.4 and BA.5 strains overtook BA.2 in the second week of June in Wales.
Health officials say the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants are six times more transmissible than the original Wuhan Covid strain but that vaccines were still working to prevent serious illness in most people.
umbers of people who are reporting they have long Covid symptoms in Wales a year after being infected are estimated to be at record levels. 
re are 61,000 people -  or 2% of the population - who are estimated to still be suffering symptoms 12 months or more since having Covid.
A total of 114,000 people were estimated to have long Covid at any duration. Of these, more than half said long Covid had a ""little"" impact on their daily lives, and 24% said none at all but 20% said it had ""a lot"" of impact.
An estimated 3.73% of people in Wales report having Covid - this is the same as in Scotland, lower than in Northern Ireland but higher than all regions of England except North West and North East.
mates are based on a sample size of 14,223 people in Wales.
Across the UK, prevalence was greatest in the 50 to 69 age group, in women, and in people living in deprived areas.
A survey of more than 1,600 people with long Covid in Wales referred to the Adferiad recovery programme found around 70% were female and half were aged over 50.
Of those needing follow-up, around a quarter had hospital treatment. Average stays were around two weeks.
Fatigue, ""brain fog"" and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms.
Scientific advisers for the Welsh government estimate that potentially up to a quarter of people who have Covid may develop long Covid.
In January 2022, this would have included far higher proportions of Covid cases involving people aged between 50 and 70 - an estimated 43% of those with Covid.
But even if 6% of young people under 25 with Covid developed long-term symptoms, this could still mean more than 2,200 young people with long Covid in Wales.
was used to develop a ""social cost"" estimate for Covid, which looked at the cost to the NHS of treating Covid at different stages of the pandemic.
With the effects of the vaccine, and less patient time in hospital and intensive care, it meant this estimated cost had fallen from £21,000 per case in the second wave of the pandemic to £5,769 per case by January 2022.
Of this, more than £4,800 per case would be the cost of long Covid.
When we look at infections in communities, broken down into middle-layer super output areas, with populations averaging 5,000, there has generally a split between rural and more urban areas.
when we look at a map of community case rates for the whole pandemic, taking into account population sizes.
Wales positivity rate was around 12% in early-November - but there are far fewer PCR tests after the end of mass testing in April.
At the peak of the Omicron wave at the end of 2021, the positivity rate reached 51.6%.
Locally, Neath Port Talbot over the course of the whole pandemic had the highest positivity rate (18.8%) and Ceredigion the lowest.
Earlier in the pandemic, a 5% positivity threshold was suggested by the World Health Organisation as an indicator that infections were too high.
re was a much younger profile to cases in the third wave in the latter half of 2021.
Between January and March there was a rise in proportions of those aged 20 to 40 testing positive. 
In terms of PCR tests, the 20 to 40 age group made up more than 41% of positive results this winter.
In the most recent week, the 40 to 59 year age group still had the highest incidence for lateral flow test positives. 
All of Wales' 22 council areas saw falls in their under-25 case rates in the last week of figures, which included the period when mass testing ended. 
30 to 39 age group had the largest proportion of cases in the last, most reliable week for PCR tests.
Over the winter months, the under-19 age group has made up 20% of cases, a rise on the year before.
More than 8.7 million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic, with the first positive result recorded in Swansea on 27 February 2020.
For most of the first wave, testing was confined to hospitals and some care homes but mass testing became available in the spring of 2020.
rt of April 2022, although it will remain in place for hospital patients and there will be some for vulnerable people and those with symptoms in care homes.
re are around 4,500 PCR tests currently taking place each week, compared to around 200,000 a week at the pandemic's peak.
g that's processed privately - at so-called Lighthouse labs - is no longer taking place.
Free lateral flow tests (LFTs) are no longer available, except to certain groups and in certain settings.
From the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, they had been used more for asymptomatic people going to work or attending events.
ween April and July 2022, people with symptoms were asked to take LFTs.
umber reporting tests had been falling as a result of the end of freely-available LFT kits but after a short rise numbers have fallen again.
most recent week saw the lowest weekly total so far with 9,221 results, with 1,466 positive.
Up to the end of routine testing in April 2022, about 17,000 PCR tests routinely took place in hospitals each week and up to 30,000 weekly in care homes. 
re have also now been changes to guidance for Covid testing in hospitals, although patients will still be tested before admission or ahead of surgery or chemotherapy.
Since the end of mass testing, only about 4,000-5,000 PCR tests are being carried out each week.
Altogether, around 32,500 positive results were recorded in care homes over the course of the routine testing programme from autumn 2020.
Care home staff no longer need to take a weekly PCR test, while free lateral flow tests will only be provided in limited circumstances.
Care Inspectorate Wales figures also show 26 care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.
School absences for Covid-related reasons are no longer being recorded. 
We saw over the 2021-22 academic year, 69.1% of pupils missed at least half a day's schooling because of Covid.
Meanwhile, absence in general was much higher than in previous years - running at an average of 11% in primary-aged pupils and 16.3% in secondary-aged children during the 2021-22 academic year.
was more than twice the absence rate in pre-pandemic years.
Analysis of these figures showed 10% were persistently absent - and this rose to 21% of those from poorer backgrounds.
In the financial year ending in March 2021, the first year of the pandemic, spending on infectious diseases in the NHS in Wales jumped by £373 million.

health	Monkeypox given new name by global health experts	"Monkeypox will now be known as mpox, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced, after complaints over racist and stigmatising language linked to the virus's name.
rm will be used alongside the new one for a year, before being phased out.
Mpox was decided on after lengthy discussions between experts, countries and the general public.
It can easily be used in English as well as other languages, the WHO said.
Human monkeypox was first identified in 1970 and named after the disease caused by the virus was discovered in captive monkeys more than a decade before.
Since then, the WHO has introduced advice on naming diseases.
It stresses the need to minimise unnecessary negative impact on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare, and to avoid causing offence to any cultural, social, national or ethnic groups.
During the Covid pandemic, it recommended that variants were referred to using letters of the Greek alphabet because they were ""non-stigmatising"" and easy to pronounce.
r, there has been unusual spread of mpox virus - a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox - in many countries outside central and west Africa, where it is often found.
In July, the WHO declared a global health emergency because of the worldwide surge in people developing symptoms, including a high fever and skin lesions or rash.
Watch: Dan spoke about his experience of contracting monkeypox at the start of June
Cases of the disease have been declining for several months now, but more than 100 different countries have been affected in 2022 - prompting huge demand for vaccine supplies to protect those most at risk.
US, Brazil, Spain, France and the UK have reported the highest total number of mpox cases this year. Globally, there have been 50 deaths from the virus.
Since May, the UK has reported more than 3,500 cases but a rollout of vaccines to vulnerable groups helped drive down numbers following a peak in July.

health	Winter set to be worst ever for A&E waits, health leaders warn	"NHS is facing the worst winter for A&E waits on record, as hospitals are being ""pressurised like never before"", health leaders have warned.
Royal College of Emergency Medicine says it believes this will have been the worst December for hospital bed occupancy and emergency care delays.
warning comes as hospitals face soaring demand driven by winter infections like flu, strep A and Covid.
government says it is ""working tirelessly"" to ensure patient care.
A number of NHS trusts have declared critical incidents in recent days, signalling they are unable to function as normal due to extraordinary pressure.
Dr Adrian Boyle, the president of the RCEM, told the BBC that hospitals were ""too full"" and the situation was ""much worse than in previous years"".
Ambulances waiting outside hospitals was the ""most obvious marker"" of this, Dr Boyle told Radio 4's Today programme.
In November, around 37,837 people waited more than 12 hours in A&E for a decision to be admitted to a hospital department, according to data from NHS England.
was more than triple the equivalent figure for November 2021, when an estimated 10,646 waited longer than 12 hours.
In separate remarks to the PA news agency, Dr Boyle said he ""would not be at all surprised"" if December proved to be the worst month on record for hospital occupancy rates. 
Over 90% of senior doctors reported there had been people waiting in their emergency department for more than 24 hours last week, he added. 
Dr Boyle remarked: ""The gallows joke about this is now that 24 hours in A&E is not a documentary, it's a way of life."" 
He said the health service had been stretched further by a ""staff retention crisis"", as well as recent nurse and ambulance worker strikes and a ""demand shock"" caused by winter infections.
Fears of a ""twindemic"" of flu and Covid infections were ""sadly being realised"", added MP Steve Brine, chair of the Commons health and social care select committee.
was ""very heavily weighted"" towards flu infections, Mr Brine said in his own interview with the BBC.  
Flu case numbers in Wales have put the country's hospitals in an ""unprecedented situation"", says its top doctor - and those with symptoms have been asked to stay away from hospitals.
At the same time, the 111 telephone helpline has come under ""significant pressure"", Dr Sir Frank Atherton said. People have instead been urged to consult the 111 website.
Meanwhile in England, the latest figures show there were more than 3,700 patients a day in hospital with flu last week - up from 520 a day the month before, and just 34 a day this time last year.
Among the NHS trusts to have declared ""critical incidents"" in recent days are:
Other trusts previously declared critical incidents but have since removed the status as conditions improved - including Surrey and Sussex Healthcare, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals, East of England Ambulance, and University Hospitals of Derby and Burton. 
On top of this, several ambulance services have declared critical incidents over the past two weeks - with North East Ambulance Service and East of England Ambulance Service doing so twice. 
No critical incidents have been declared in Scotland, but A&E doctors have urged NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to declare one over ""grave concerns"" over patient safety, the BBC understands.
In his own comments to the PA news agency, Dr Nick Scriven, the former president of the Society for Acute Medicine, warned that UK's urgent care system was being ""pressurised like never before"".
He urged people to ""consider carefully"" whether or not their problem required emergency care before attending a hospital.
Dr Scriven said the NHS should consider a ""short-term moratorium"" on the pressure to ease backlogs in elective procedures - with services working together ""for the common good"".
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social care said: ""We recognise the pressures the NHS is facing following the impact of the pandemic and are working tirelessly to ensure people get the care they need, backed by up to £14.1bn additional funding for health and social care over the next two years. 
""This winter, the government has provided an extra £500m to speed up hospital discharge and free up beds - and the NHS is creating the equivalent of at least 7,000 more beds to help reduce A&E waits and get ambulances back on the road.
""We're supporting and growing the health and social care workforce through training and recruitment campaigns at home and abroad, and there are record numbers of staff working for the NHS, including 9,300 more nurses and almost 4,000 more doctors compared to September 2021."""	/news/health-64131551

It comes as some North West Ambulance Service staff are on strike.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay has criticised unions for walking out when the system was under pressure.
rust, which covers Lancashire and south Cumbria, including Furness General Hospital in Barrow, said it was experiencing ""a sustained increase in demand"" for all services.
It urged the public to call NHS 111 to ensure they are directed to the correct service. 
""Our priority, as always, is to ensure safe and high-quality care for people in Lancashire and south Cumbria,"" it said.
""Irrespective of how busy local NHS services are, and any industrial action, it is essential that people who need urgent medical care continue to come forward - especially in emergency and life-threatening cases, when someone is seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk.""
Meanwhile, thousands of ambulance staff in England and Wales are striking over pay and conditions, which saw a walkout of more than 10,000 paramedics, control room staff and support workers who are members of the Unison, GMB and Unite unions.
Ambulances will respond to life-threatening situations.

Barrow's ambulance station has been alive with the sound of beeping car horns - not sirens - today. 
As drivers passed the striking line of paramedics in florescent jackets, there were plenty of waves and honks of support. 
""People have mostly been lovely,"" one paramedic told me, ""but we did get one man shout 'murderers' at us.""
Supportive members of the public offered the striking workers snacks and sweets, including five tubs of chocolates.

BBC Radio Cumbria's Jennie Dennett said there had been ""loads of beeps of support"" with the public giving those on strike snacks and tubs of sweets, but one man had shouted abuse as people stood outside.
Laura Milner from Ulverston has been with the ambulance service for more than 20 years and said she had ""never known it so bad"".
She said paramedics were ""frustrated"" queueing in A&E for up to eight hours and unable to leave to respond to the most serious emergency calls.
""We are getting calls and going five hours later and people are deceased - it's just so wrong,"" she said.
""The care system is broken - it just needs money ploughing into it.""
Paramedic Michelle Doherty, who is also a representative for the GMB, said it was patient safety and not pay that was the biggest issue for strikers.
""The NHS can't go on the way its going - it is just going to internally combust and there is going to be nothing to help get it back to where it needs to be,"" she said.
""Everyone is going above and beyond their normal duties to try and help people out. 
""Some politicians are saying that today we are potentially putting people at risk but we are still responding.
""They don't understand that because of the way the system's going and the amount of money that they have stripped from the social care fund and the NHS means that patients are getting put in jeopardy every day.""
Matt Cooper, from the North West Ambulance Service, said it would be running at about 35% of its usual operational capacity, with the military called in to help.
""We are here for people that are suffering life-threatening emergencies and we would urge them still to call us,"" he added.
North Cumbria Integrated Care said it had plans in place to manage the impact of industrial action and its ""priority is to keep our patients safe"".
It said that it was working to keep ambulances on the road by creating additional space in and next to our A&E departments so they were not ""held up at our hospitals"".
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said most ambulance staff had received a pay rise of at least 4% and further rises were unaffordable.
""We know these are challenging times for everyone and we have given a fair pay settlement that strikes a careful balance between recognising the vital importance of public sector workers whilst minimising inflationary pressures and managing the country's debt,"" they said.

health	Record numbers faced four-hour A&E waits in England in October	"A record number of people had a long wait to be seen in A&E departments in October, NHS England figures show. 
More than 550,000 patients were waiting more than four hours in major A&E units, up from 492,000 in September - the highest proportion on record.
Society of Acute Medicine warned the situation was ""unacceptably poor"" and likely to deteriorate further. 
NHS said it faced the busiest October ever in A&E and for the most serious ambulance call-outs.
monthly data from NHS England showed hospitals coming under increasing pressure ahead of the busy winter period.
roportion of all patients in A&E and minor injury units being seen, discharged or admitted within four hours fell to 69% in October, down from 71% in September, and well below the 95% NHS target. 
umber of the sickest patients having to wait a long time for a spare hospital bed also increased sharply. 
Some 43,792 patients had to wait at least 12 hours in A&E after a decision to admit to a ward had been made, up 34% from 32,776 in September, and the highest number in records going back to August 2010. 
rage response times for ambulances also rose again across much of the country. 
Outside the capital, response times for a category two emergency, such as a stroke or suspected heart attack, rose in almost every English region.
In the West Midlands, the average time to reach those patients increased to one hour, eight minutes in October, up from 45 minutes in September, and well above the 18-minute target set out in the NHS constitution. 
Data from the London Ambulance Service was not available for October.
most recent weekly data from Scottish hospitals also showed record numbers of patients having to wait in A&E before being treated, admitted or discharged. 
Dr Tim Cooksley, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said all parts of the NHS were ""unquestionably struggling"".
""This latest set of performance data show that standards are at an unacceptably poor level for both patients and staff, with an expectation that this will deteriorate further over the winter months,"" he said. 
""Pressures are at unsustainable levels and the results are scant justice for acute care staff who continue to strive to deliver a reasonable quality of care. Morale for patients and staff is low with little expectation of short-term improvement.""
Prof Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England's medical director, said: ""There is no doubt October has been a challenging month for staff who are now facing a tripledemic of Covid, flu and record pressure on emergency services with more people attending A&E or requiring the most urgent ambulance call-out than any other October.
""Pressure on emergency services remains high as a result of more than 13,000 beds taken up each day by people who no longer need to be in hospital.""
Separate data showed the number of people in England on a waiting list to start routine treatment, such as a knee replacement or cataract surgery, has also risen to a new record high.  
A total of 7.1 million people were waiting to start treatment at the end of September, NHS England said. 
up from seven million at the end of August and is the highest number since records began in August 2007. 
A total of 401,537 people had been waiting more than 52 weeks to start their treatment, up from 387,257 in August. 
government and NHS England have set a target to eliminate all waits of more than a year by March 2025.
Very long waits of more than two years have fallen slightly, while the number of people waiting 18 months for treatment has dropped by almost 60% in one year, NHS England said.

health	Canada looks to delay assisted dying for mentally ill	"Canada's government has said it wants to delay expanding medically assisted dying for people with mental illness. 
Access to euthanasia was set to broaden in March to people whose sole conditions are mental disorders.
xpansion has come under fire from some experts, who worry that it offers death as an option to people with suicidal thoughts.
Supporters of the measure, however, say excluding people with mental illness is discriminatory.
xpansion of assisted dying to people with mental illness would mean that Canada would have one of the most liberal euthanasia laws in the world.
Canada's Justice Minister David Lametti acknowledged on Thursday that more time might be needed to get the country's Medical Assistance in Dying law right. 
""We want to be prudent, we want to move in a step-by-step way so that we don't make mistakes,"" Mr Lametti said at a news conference. 
Canada made medically assisted death legal in September 2016. The legislation was passed after Canada's Supreme Court ruled that doctors could help patients who had severe and incurable medical conditions to die. 
Advocacy group Dying with Dignity has supported the expansion, saying that excluding people with mental illness from Canada's assisted dying law is ""stigmatising, discriminatory and unconstitutional"".
But the law has been criticised by those who worry that it is being offered without safeguards in place for people who are disabled and are living in poverty, and that assisted dying has been easier to access for some than affordable housing. 
Some psychiatrists have also expressed concern that Canada's health care system is not ready to handle requests for assisted dying from people with mental disorders, as it is difficult to predict who can recover from a mental illness. 
A petition from the Society of Canadian Psychiatry has asked that the expansion be delayed until 2024, though it remains unclear how long the government wants to delay its implementation.

health	Infectious Covid virus can stay on some groceries for days	"Covid virus can reside on some ready-to-eat groceries for days, UK experts have confirmed.  
Scientists carried out tests for the Food Standards Agency (FSA), purposely smearing the virus on to packaging and food products, including fruit, pastries and bottled drinks.  
ms that people might put in their mouth without cooking or washing.
risk to consumers remains very low, they say. 
r report says it should be noted that ""foods and packaging considered as part of this study were artificially inoculated with Sars-Cov-2 and therefore are not a reflection of contamination levels found on these foods at retail, and lower levels of contamination will require less time to decline to undetectable levels.""
For most food products tested there was a ""significant drop"" in the levels of virus over the first 24 hours. 
But in some cases traces survived for about a week, the University of Southampton team found.   
""For a highly infectious agent such as Sars-Cov-2, which can be transmitted through touching contaminated surfaces and then the face, these findings are highly noteworthy,"" they say. 
""The public may be interested in the finding that virus may persist in an infectious state, on foods and food packaging surfaces, for several days under certain common conditions.""
But they add that there is no need for shoppers to take extra precautions when handling food - other than washing your hands before preparing and eating it, and rinsing fresh produce to help to remove any contamination on the surface. 
ked foods often sold loose at grocery, deli or bakery counters, such as apples, peppers, cheese, ham, olives, crusty bread and croissants.  
kaging tested included drink bottles, cartons and cans.  
mount of virus they applied was designed to simulate how much might land on food if someone who was infected coughed or sneezed near it, for example, because Covid is spread by respiratory droplets.
Breathing in infected droplets, rather than touching infected surfaces, is still the main way people catch Covid.
Anthony Wilson, microbiological risk assessment team leader at the FSA, said: ""In the early stages of the pandemic, we didn't know much about how the virus would survive on different food surfaces and packaging, so the risk assessment was based on a worst-case assumption.
""This research gives us additional insight into the stability of coronavirus on the surfaces of a variety of foods and confirms that assumptions we made in the early stages of the pandemic were appropriate, and that the probability that you can catch Covid via food is very low.""
m examined a range of temperatures and humidity levels to mimic typical storage conditions, measuring the rate of inactivation of the virus, and found:  
rus appears to last longer on produce with uneven surfaces - broccoli and raspberries - than on smooth skinned ones such as apples (although some chilled fresh peppers had detectable virus a week later). 
Apples contain natural chemicals in their skin that may start to break down the Covid virus within minutes or hours, the scientists say.  
Pastries such as pain au chocolat appeared to have little virus after a few hours - perhaps because they are coated in a fine layer of egg wash during baking, say the FSA scientists. Eggs contain arachidonic acid which might have an antiviral effect. 
Cheese and cold meat, with a high protein and fat content, appear to allow the virus to survive for days - possibly a week.  
Covid can survive for up to a week on plastic surfaces. For cartons, it could be several days. For aluminium cans, it is probably only hours, say the researchers."	/news/health-63819818
health	Pitfalls lie ahead as China charts exit from zero-Covid	"After unprecedented mass protests against zero-Covid, Chinese authorities have made their most decisive move yet to exit the punishing policy.
On Wednesday, officials announced the end of forced centralised quarantine, allowing people with mild Covid to isolate at home, as well as limits to lockdowns, fewer checks of Covid test results, and freer travel around the country. It came after various cities began easing local restrictions.
Even as China charts a course out of zero-Covid, it must navigate several pitfalls that lie ahead.
main challenge is ensuring the inevitable uptick in infections does not lead to mass deaths.
""China's big risk now is removing Covid restrictions without having a broadly vaccinated population,"" said James Crabtree, executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore.
""China will hope to reopen in a targeted way, protecting those who are yet to be vaccinated, but so far at least other countries have not been able to do this, and have generally seen that re-opening leads to a wave of cases.""
worrying for China given its low Covid immunity among the elderly, and the fact that it continues to rely on less effective domestic vaccines.
When other places like South Korea and Singapore opened up, they had well-vaccinated populations who received foreign jabs such as Pfizer, Moderna and Astrazeneca, but still could not prevent a spike in infections.
Current figures from Chinese authorities show only 69% of those aged above 60 and 40% of those over 80 have had a booster shot. 
Accelerating their vaccinations will remain a challenge given the continued distrust in vaccines among this group.
""Many old people have underlying diseases. They reckon it won't be safe to get vaccinated. But in fact, it is safe,"" the head of China's Covid expert panel, Prof Liang Wannian, told the BBC previously.
On Wednesday, Chinese authorities laid out plans such as temporary and mobile vaccination clinics, and also urged local authorities to use ""incentives to mobilise the enthusiasm of the elderly to get vaccinated"". 
re reportedly planning to boost the immunity of most elderly by the end of January, before Chinese New Year when huge numbers of people will move around the country.
In the meantime, with its elderly population still vulnerable, China risks seeing a wave of severe Covid cases, which would in turn result in many deaths if hospitals get overwhelmed. This was exactly what happened in Hong Kong when the Omicron wave hit the city earlier this year.
It may be why mainland China has now shifted to home quarantine for mild and asymptomatic cases. Earlier this week, the Global Times state media outlet singled out a similar move by Singapore as something worth emulating, as it would free up resources and hospital beds for more severe cases.
But this goal may be difficult to achieve.
Singapore has a strong healthcare system with various options, and could successfully shift to home quarantine because people with mild Covid could seek treatment from the country's large network of community clinics and telemedicine providers.
Meanwhile China still has patchy healthcare infrastructure which suffered from a  a slowdown in investment during the pandemic. In many places, people continue to rely on hospitals for even basic treatment, pointed out Donald Low, a public policy expert with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
""In China, there is relatively scarce community-based care, compared to hospital-based care. It's hard to follow the Singapore model on that… China had two years to build that infrastructure, but they didn't,"" said Prof Low.
ming of the relaxation of measures also presents a challenge. 
Dr Siddharth Sridhar, a clinical virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said it is especially worrying that China is opening up during winter, when the virus is more likely to spread more rapidly.
So what could China do?
It will have to go slow in its reopening, or else it will see an ""exponentially worse"" situation than what happened in Hong Kong earlier this year, warned Dr Sridhar.
""Hong Kong is just 7.5 million people. Decent public healthcare infrastructure. Deep pockets. It doesn't apply to many places in China.""
A recent Bloomberg analysis based on US and Europe data in the first six months of the Omicron outbreak calculated that a similar full reopening in China would lead to 5.8 million people admitted to intensive care. This would completely overwhelm China's healthcare system that has less than four ICU beds per 100,000 people.
Chinese government could redirect resources from containment to setting up a door-to-door vaccination campaign, boost critical care infrastructure such as ensuring oxygen supplies, and train as many people as possible in basic critical care, added Dr Sridhar.  
Experts say it also needs to vastly improve its public healthcare messaging to allay public fears of the virus, and give clear instructions on what to do if people test positive for Covid. 
During Hong Kong's Omicron wave, poor and unclear government directives led to hospitals flooded with cases as many people panicked, even though they were allowed to isolate at home.
Prof Low said Chinese authorities could lay out a roadmap to live with Covid, as Singapore did. It also has to be honest with its people about Covid inevitably becoming endemic and something they have to live with, he added. 
""People have a zero-risk bias, and the government has to counteract that by saying we always will have the Covid risk.""
At the same time, caution will be needed, said Dr Sridhar. ""A big mistake right now would be to say Omicron is harmless and we are okay, that's what we are doing, now it's time to open up.
""That's just going to be inviting disaster on yourself.""  "	/news/world-asia-china-63885614
health	Covid in China: Officials must share data on its impact, says WHO	"Chinese officials must share more real-time information on Covid in the country as infections surge, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.
Many of the country's strict restrictions have been lifted over the last few weeks, but cases have soared and several countries are now screening travellers from China.
WHO officials say they want to see more data on hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions and deaths.
It also wants figures on vaccinations.
United States, Spain, France, South Korea, India, Italy, Japan and Taiwan have all imposed Covid tests for travellers from China, as they fear a renewed spread of the virus.
And passengers arriving in England from China will have to provide a negative test before they board a flight. 
In a statement issued after talks with Chinese officials the UN health agency said: ""WHO again asked for regular sharing of specific and real-time data on the epidemiological situation... and data on vaccinations delivered and vaccination status, especially in vulnerable people and those over 60.""
gency said it was willing to provide support on these areas, as well as help with addressing the issue of vaccine hesitancy.
It also stressed ""the importance of monitoring, and the timely publication of data, to help China and the global community to formulate accurate risk assessments and to inform effective responses"".
WHO's technical advisory group on the evolution of Covid-19 is set to hold a meeting on Tuesday. The agency says it has invited Chinese scientists to present detailed data on viral sequencing.
It says it is ""understandable"" that some countries are imposing fresh restrictions on people travelling from China.
WATCH: Ros Atkins on... China’s Covid surge
udden lifting of many of China's restrictions follows November's protests against the government's management of the disease.
Until then, China had one of the toughest anti-Covid regimes in the world - known as a zero-Covid policy.
It included strict lockdowns even if only a handful of cases had been found, mass testing in places where cases were reported, and people with Covid having to isolate at home or under quarantine at government facilities.
Lockdowns have now been scrapped, and quarantine rules have been abolished. People are now free to travel abroad again.
Cases have since been on the rise, with the Chinese government reporting about 5,000 a day. But analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily caseload may be closer to one million.
Officially there have only been 13 Covid deaths throughout December, but UK-based health data firm Airfinity said on Thursday that around 9,000 people in China are probably dying each day from the disease. "	/news/world-asia-64131713
health	Antrim Area Hospital: Hospital 'unsafe' on Saturday night	"A major incident was declared in the Northern Health Trust at the weekend because the situation was ""unsafe,"" the chief executive of the trust has said.
Jennifer Welsh was speaking after people were told not to come to Antrim Area Hospital on Saturday night ""in any circumstances"".
A major incident means there are too many patients for staff to deal with safely. 
was taken after the emergency department reached capacity. 
""At the time we called the incident there were 131 patients and about 66 had a decision to admit and no bed available,"" Ms Welsh told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.
""It's not just a numbers game but is about the acuity of the patients and how sick they are,"" she said.
""Our resuscitation unit was over full,"" she added.
""We simply could not cope. It was safest thing to do to close the door and convey people to next nearest ED [emergency department] to make sure they begin the urgent treatment they need.
""It was the right call to say it was unsafe - it was at the time.""
A social media post from the hospital said the hospital was still under ""extreme pressure"" on Sunday.
On Monday night, the Department of Health said it remained deeply concerned about the situation in hospitals and across the health and social care system.
""The fundamental reality is that we have a serious mismatch between demand for care and the capacity of the system to provide it,"" the department said.
""Hospitals do not have unlimited capacity and it is imperative that when patients have been deemed medically fit, they leave the hospital setting.""
It's a very brave decision, particularly in Northern Ireland, to declare a major incident.
Over the years we have had a culture where it's been seen as a failure when a chief executive comes out and says they can no longer cope - but when you think about it, being unsafe in a hospital is a contradiction.
I have been told that the emergency department at the Royal Belfast Hospital was in a similar position.
I spoke to a number of staff at the weekend and was told there was serious overcrowding in Belfast and in one person's words ""alarming levels of patient congestion"".
Staff said it felt like a very unsafe environment for both patients and staff. 
felt compromised in being able to deliver care in an emergency environment.
On Sunday morning there were 116 people waiting in the ED, figures similar to Antrim, and 61 people waiting to be admitted.
Staff in Belfast were saying they felt they had to keep their doors open because Antrim got in first.
We heard there was a third trust also experiencing a lot of pressure so it's not an isolated incident and the question is, what happens next?
On Monday evening, the South Eastern Trust warned its emergency department at the Ulster Hospital was under ""extreme pressure"".
rust said 164 patients were in the emergency department, 53 awaiting admission.
It issued an appeal for nursing staff to help across critical areas on Monday night.
Ms Welsh said the situation at Antrim Area Hospital would have been ""unthinkable"" five years ago but now it was ""normal business - and not acceptable"".
""The situation is pressured and not just in Antrim but across many of Northern Ireland's emergency departments,"" she said. 
She said new beds were coming in February.
Ms Welsh said Antrim Area Hospital had its highest number of attendances last month.
She added that the Northern Trust was Northern Ireland's largest health trust area geographically and had the highest number of people over 75 - two things that drive hospital admission.
Rita Devlin, from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), told Good Morning Ulster her members were at maximum capacity.
She said the threshold for a major incident was when when a hospital could no longer cope with the amount of patients in its emergency department and there was no possibility of getting patients out of the department.
""We have had times before where the trusts have asked for ambulance diverts but never in my time have I ever heard a hospital tell patients not to come under any circumstances,"" Ms Devlin said.
""I have been contacted by members from three different trusts about overcrowding and unsafe issues for patients, and nurses telling me they can't go on.""
She said the situation should be ringing ""alarm bells for everyone in Northern Ireland"".
She added that health needed ""fundamental transformation,"" which was impossible without ""political leadership"".
Dr Paul Kerr, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine Northern Ireland, warned that one hospital closing its doors put pressure on other hospitals.
""The domino effect occurs in the situation where one hospital says it has to close its doors and the next hospital is going to get more patients and they're going to face a critical incident,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.
""It's a very small system and we have to try and avoid this situation happening because that is going to put us all at risk of being in the same situation.""
Declaring a major incident is rare and under such circumstances, there is a call-out for staff to come into work. 
A potential major incident was declared at Antrim Area Hospital in February but was stood down after several hours.
On Sunday the Belfast Trust appealed to any available nursing staff for help during the nightshift."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63620959
health	Doncaster surgery sends cancer text instead of festive message	"A GP surgery accidentally told patients they had aggressive lung cancer instead of wishing them a merry Christmas. 
Askern Medical Practice sent the text message to people registered with the surgery in Doncaster on 23 December. 
Sarah Hargreaves, who was waiting for medical test results, said she ""broke down"" when she received the text, only to be later told it was sent in error.
group which runs the surgery said nobody was available for comment. The centre has almost 8,000 patients.
first text told recipients they had ""aggressive lung cancer with metastases"", a type of secondary malignant growth.
It directed patients to fill out a DS1500 form, which allows people with terminal diseases to claim certain benefits.
However, about an hour later people received a second text telling them it was an error and it was meant to wish them a merry Christmas instead.
Ms Hargreaves said after she received the original text while she was out shopping, she ""felt sick to my teeth and broke down"".
She added: ""I had just had a mole removed and was awaiting a result from a biopsy and I had been to hospital as my smear test came back abnormal, so yes, I was very worried.""
Despite repeated calls to the surgery, she said she struggled to get through to speak to someone.
Carl Chegwin, another of the surgery's users who, along with his mother, received the text, said he was left upset by the out-of-the-blue message which ""was enough to break someone"".
""The first thing I thought was, 'is this some kind of sick joke?'"" Mr Chegwin said.
""It completely took me by surprise... It's not often I go to the doctors, then out of the blue, it's cancer. I'm sat there scratching my head thinking, 'I do smoke, do they know something I don't?'""
""They've just told people a few days before Christmas they've got terminal lung cancer. They can't do that.""
Meanwhile, a woman, who asked not to be named, said she was left feeling ""very worried"" about the text, with family members recently having tests about ongoing chest issues.
""I rang the doctors but on hold as usual. So, I walked round as I live around the corner and there were, I'd say, six people all there panicking as they had got the same text.""
xt apologised for the error, with some patients getting repeat messages from the surgery.
""What if that message was meant for someone, and then they are told it's a Christmas message, then again told, 'oh no, that was actually meant for you'?"" Mr Chegwin asked.
""If it's one of their admins that's sent out a mass text, I wouldn't be trusting them to empty the bins.""

health	West Midlands GP calls for better support for veterans	"Doctor Robin Simpson said he did not want veterans to be disadvantaged by their service to the country
A former Army doctor has urged GP surgeries to sign up to a scheme to give military veterans better support and care.
Robin Simpson's own practice in Hampton in Arden, near Solihull, West Midlands, has become a ""veteran friendly"" surgery.
Royal College of GPs scheme gives them access to specialised guidance and training about what veterans may need.

m O'Sullivan served in Afghanistan as an Army reservist in 2007 and found last year's withdrawal of troops brought back painful memories. 
He said he was struggling to process them and turned to Mr Simpson's surgery for help.
""I came to speak to my GP who actually was incredibly understanding and got me some really good help very quickly,"" he said.
More than 1,300 practices in England have signed up to the scheme, according to the Royal College of GPs.
Former RAF pilot John Bransbury also uses the Hampton in Arden surgery and said it was a comfort knowing they understood his background.

health	Fermanagh: One of NI's biggest GP practices at risk of closure	"One of Northern Ireland's largest GP practices is at risk of closure after its operator handed its contract back to the Department of Health. 
Maple Healthcare in Lisnaskea declared its intention in a letter last week.
Confirming the news on Saturday, the department reassured patients that services would continue at the practice for the next six months.
It added that a recruitment process would begin in order to put new arrangements in place.
""Patients at the practice do not need to take any action. They should continue to contact their practice as normal,"" a spokesperson said. 
""We will be writing out to all practice patients to keep them informed as this process begins.""
umber of partners at Maple Healthcare has reduced over the past 18 months, while another is due to retire in early 2023. 
It is understood one option would be for the Western Trust to take on the management of the practice. 
ractice's operators cited ""excessive stresses and intolerable pressures"" at work as some of the reasons for handing back the contract.
""The remaining partners find it inconceivable that they could continue to carry the burden of responsibility of running the practice,"" they added.
rators said they were hopeful a solution could emerge over the coming months. 
It added that if another contract holder could be found to assume responsibility for the provision of services, then the current team of doctors could continue to deliver for patients.
""If we can keep together, we are hopeful that high-quality clinical services can continue uninterrupted.""
In recent years, the surgery had stepped in to provide services when neighbouring GPs retired. 
Maple Healthcare taking over the patients of three practices in Roslea, Newtownbutler and Lisnaskea.
ws that the practice's contract has been handed back comes days after the Western Trust confirmed plans to temporarily remove emergency surgery services from the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen. 
Sinn Féin assembly member Colm Gildernew said the contract returning to the department was ""another body blow for the provision of health services in the area"". 
Mr Gildernew, a former chair of Stormont's health committee, said it was ""a critical situation and one that needs to be addressed urgently"".
""We need to urgently take the steps needed to sustain and maintain that GP service in that area,"" he added.
Dr Alan Stout, co-chair of the British Medical Association (BMA)'s GP committee, said the problem in the south west ""has been long known"".
""That's where we have got our oldest GPs,"" he added. ""A third of the GPs are over the age of 55 and imminently going to retire. 
""It is also the hardest area for us to recruit new GPs.
""We can see the problems, We can anticipate the problems but we consistently fail to address them.""
Dr Stout says nine GP services across Northern Ireland have either handed back their contract or are in the process of doing so. He warned more are on the verge of following suit.
""We have 22 that are in immediate difficulty, that we are trying our utmost to help. There's no doubt that number will increase."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63689347

government has said it is ""resolute"" on pay after nursing unions threatened to escalate strike action if ministers do not join talks within 48 hours of Tuesday's walkout.
Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) are due to stage a second strike on 20 December.
Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden insisted ministers were ""reasonable"" but had a duty to keep finances under control.
He insisted that nurses' pay should be decided by the NHS pay review body.
In July, this body recommended a £1,400 rise, with slightly more for experienced nurses - an increase of about 4% on average.
RCN is calling for a pay rise of 19%, but union leader Pat Cullen said this was a ""starting point"" and any new offer would be put to members.
Urging the unions to call off the strike, Mr Dowden told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: ""We will be resolute to this, because it would be irresponsible to allow public sector pay and inflation to get out of control and we owe a wider duty to the public to make sure we keep our public finances under control.""
Challenged about the government's reluctance to engage on pay, the cabinet minister in charge of contingency planning for strikes, said the government was ""always willing talk"".
""We're trying to be reasonable, we're trying to be proportionate and we're trying to be fair,"" he said.
He added that the government was trying to ""take the politics out"" of the issue of pay by accepting the NHS review body's recommendations.
But Ms Cullen says ministers are using the recommendations as ""cover"" and her union was ""seriously looking at whether we take part anymore"".
""We have been hoodwinked into lending credence to this process for years and if we aren't being listened to then it cannot be independent,"" she added.
A small number of Conservative MPs have called on the government to revisit its offer to nurses. The latest to do so, former minister Caroline Nokes, called for the government to take ""another look at the negotiations"". 
Some Tories, including former cabinet minister Robert Buckland, have also said the pay review body should be asked to make fresh recommendations.
Mr Dowden repeated the government's claim that inflation-matching pay rises across the public sector would cost a further £28bn - insisting the figure was ""robust"" despite criticism from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank who provided a figure of half of this.
Labour-run Welsh government, which is responsible for the NHS in Wales, has also accepted the pay review's recommendations, saying it was taking this decision to protect spending.
On Sunday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the UK government had not given it a big enough budget to pay for a higher increase, and funding a rise from its existing budget would reduce treatment for patients.
In Northern Ireland, the power-sharing government would normally negotiate pay but is suspended due to a political stalemate over post-Brexit rules.
Scottish government has offered NHS workers pay rises averaging 7.5% in a bid to avoid industrial action. It has been accepted by Unite and Unison, two major NHS unions representing paramedics, midwives, nurses and support staff. However, it has been rejected by another, the GMB.
Meanwhile, a ballot of RCN members in Scotland closes on Monday. It is not clear when results will be announced.
RCN's strike on Thursday was the largest in its history. Across England around 9,999 staff were absent, while nearly 16,000 appointments, procedures and surgeries were rescheduled. 
It involved around a quarter of hospitals and community teams in England, all trusts in Northern Ireland and all but one health board in Wales. 
Ms Cullen said an escalation would involve a greater number of hospitals and scaling back support for non-emergency services.
During action so far, the RCN has said it will still staff chemotherapy, emergency cancer services, dialysis, critical care units, neonatal and paediatric intensive care.
Some areas of mental health and learning disability and autism services are also exempt.
urses will be followed on 21 December by a strike by ambulance staff, when Unison, GMB and Unite members take action on 28 December. GMB union members will go on strike again on 28 December.
Around 1,200 members of the military are being drafted in to cover for ambulance workers, as well as striking Border Force staff.
However, health unions warn military staff are not ""sufficiently trained"".
Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, said there was ""unfortunately more risk"" to patients during a strike, but said: ""Every single day patients are being put at risk because of the staffing crisis"".
Chief of the Defence Staff's words are carefully calibrated.
When asked about the strikes, he does not criticise the government for calling in the armed forces, nor those who're taking industrial action.
Admiral Sir Tony Radakin knows the armed forces must stay out of politics and he makes clear the military is there to serve the nation, whatever the task. 
But his words do reflect some of the frustration within the armed forces at once again being called out to do someone else's job. It's by no means the first time. 
were heavily relied on during the Covid pandemic. In 2012 they had to provide security for the London Olympics.  
When asked about the strike action, the head of the armed forces reminds the public that's not their primary role - it's to defend the nation. 
Being pulled away to fulfil other roles can often have an impact on training, although it will not affect military operations. 
Admiral Radakin's comments do reflect frustration, rather than anger over what they're being asked to do. He also knows that when the armed forces help out most people are grateful.
Industrial action has also been taken by rail workers, Royal Mail staff and other sectors in recent weeks over pay disputes as the cost of living rises.
government has announced it will publish a new ""resilience framework"" on Monday, aimed at improving how the UK prepares for and responds to critical issues like strikes.

health	South Cumbria and Lancashire Covid jabs at-home service to end	"A service that saw thousands of people vaccinated against Covid in their homes will come to an end this month.
NHS Vaccine at Home initiative has been running across Lancashire and South Cumbria since January.
regional service, originally set up to help people who were shielding or unable to leave home, will stop taking bookings from 9 December.
It is being withdrawn because shielding is no longer necessary and demand for the service has declined.
Lancashire and South Cumbria Integrate Care Board said more than 4,000 people had been vaccinated in this way in the past 11 months.
More than 100 NHS workers making up 40 vaccination teams delivered the service.
Jane Scattergood, from the Covid-19 vaccination programme, said: ""This service has been fantastic and has helped us reach more people who have been unable to come forward for a vaccine, because they didn't want to leave their home.
""Now that shielding is no longer required, demand for the service has decreased, so it will soon come to an end.""
People can continue to be vaccinated outside their homes, by booking an appointment. 
Currently anyone over 50 can get another booster jab this autumn as well as:

health	China Covid: France, Spain, S Korea and Israel tighten rules	"France and Spain have announced Covid testing on visitors from China, following a similar decision in Italy.
French government said passengers flying from China to France would have to present a negative Covid test less than 48 hours old before embarking.
Arrivals in Spain can skip the tests if they are fully vaccinated - and Spain does accept some Chinese vaccines.
Beijing has said it will fully reopen its borders next week for the first time since March 2020.
Its current Covid surge has caused wariness, with reports of hospitals filling up and waves of illness.
UK, South Korea and Israel also announced new testing rules on Friday, while the US and India have already imposed restrictions.
""At the national level, we will implement controls at airports and require travellers from China to present a negative Covid test or be fully vaccinated,"" said Spanish health minister Carolina Darias.
Neither France nor Spain have specified when the measures will come into force.
However, the French health and transport ministries said the government would publish a decree and notify EU member states.
On Thursday, the EU's disease prevention agency has said such measures were not justified in Europe, because of the levels of immunity and the fact that variants spreading in China were already present on the continent.
World Health Organization, however, has said it was ""understandable"" that some countries had decided to impose restrictions and urged Beijing to be more forthcoming about its Covid numbers.
China's foreign ministry said earlier this week that its ""epidemic situation"" overall was ""predictable and under control"".
But the true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown as officials have stopped requiring cases to be reported, and changed classifications for Covid deaths. 
South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said that travellers from China would need to have a negative PCR or antigen test before boarding flights to South Korea. 
will also need to undergo a PCR test within the first day of their arrival in South Korea.
Israel, meanwhile, has ordered foreign airlines not to allow people to travel from China unless they have tested negative - and asked its own citizens to avoid unnecessary travel there. 
Not all countries have announced controls. Germany has joined Australia, France, and Portugal in saying there will be no new rules yet.
However, Germany's health minister has said the country is seeking a co-ordinated system to monitor variants across European airports.
China's decision this week to reopen its borders on 8 January marks the last stage of the country's controversial zero-Covid policy, which President Xi Jinping had personally endorsed.
As the rest of the world transitioned to living with the virus, Beijing maintained an eradication policy involving mass testing and stringent lockdown.
In November, the frustration spilled on to the streets in rare protests against Mr Xi and his government. A week later, Beijing began to roll back the restrictions."	/news/world-asia-china-64127917
health	Alzheimer's drug lecanemab hailed as momentous breakthrough	"first drug to slow the destruction of the brain in Alzheimer's has been heralded as momentous.
research breakthrough ends decades of failure and shows a new era of drugs to treat Alzheimer's - the most common form of dementia - is possible. 
Yet the medicine, lecanemab, has only a small effect and its impact on people's daily lives is debated. 
And the drug works in the early stages of the disease, so most would miss out without a revolution in spotting it.
Lecanemab attacks the sticky gunge - called beta amyloid - that builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. 
For a medical field littered with duds, despair and disappointment, some see these trial results as a triumphant turning point. 
Alzheimer's Research UK said the findings were ""momentous"". 
One of the world's leading researchers behind the whole idea of targeting amyloid 30 years ago, Prof John Hardy, said it was ""historic"" and was optimistic ""we're seeing the beginning of Alzheimer's therapies"". Prof Tara Spires-Jones, from the University of Edinburgh, said the results were ""a big deal because we've had a 100% failure rate for a long time"".
Currently, people with Alzheimer's are given other drugs to help manage their symptoms, but none change the course of the disease.
Lecanemab is an antibody - like those the body makes to attack viruses or bacteria - that has been engineered to tell the immune system to clear amyloid from the brain.
Amyloid is a protein that clumps together in the spaces between neurons in the brain and forms distinctive plaques that are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's.
rge-scale trial involved 1,795 volunteers with early stage Alzheimer's. Infusions of lecanemab were given every fortnight. 
results, presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference in San Francisco and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, are not a miracle cure. The disease continued to rob people of their brain power, but that decline was slowed by around a quarter over the course of the 18 months of treatment. 
ready being assessed by regulators in the US who will soon decide whether lecanemab can be approved for wider use. The developers - the pharmaceutical companies Eisai and Biogen - plan to begin the approval process in other countries next year. 
David Essam, who is 78 and from Kent in the UK, took part in the international trial. 
His Alzheimer's meant he had to give up work as a joiner - he could no longer remember how to build a cabinet or use his tools. He now uses a digital watch as he can't tell time using a clock face. 
""He's not the man he was, he needs help with most things, his memory in general is almost non-existent,"" said his wife Cheryl. But she said the trial had given the family hope. 
David said: ""If somebody can slow it [Alzheimer's] down and eventually stop it all together that would be brilliant, it's just a horrible nasty thing.""
re are more than 55 million people in the world like David and the numbers with Alzheimer's disease are projected to exceed 139 million by 2050.
re is debate among scientists and doctors about the ""real world"" impact of lecanemab. 
wer decline with the drug was noticed using ratings of a person's symptoms. It's an 18-point scale, ranging from normal through to severe dementia. Those getting the drug were 0.45 points better off. 
Prof Spires-Jones said that was a ""small effect"" on the disease, but ""even though it is not dramatic, I would take it"". 
Dr Susan Kohlhaas, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said it was a ""modest effect... but it gives us a little bit of a foothold"" and the next generation of drugs would be better.
re are also risks. Brain scans showed a risk of brain bleeds (17% of participants) and brain swelling (13%). Overall, 7% of people given the drug had to stop because of side effects.
A crucial question is what happens after the 18 months of the trial, and the answers are still speculation. 
Dr Elizabeth Coulthard, who treats patients at North Bristol NHS Trust, says that people have, on average, six years of living independently once mild cognitive impairment starts.
Slow that decline by a quarter and it could equate to an extra 19 months of independent life, ""but we don't know that yet"", she says.
It is even scientifically plausible that the effectiveness could be greater in longer trials. ""I don't think we can assume that this is it,"" says Dr Kohlhass.
mergence of drugs that do alter the course of the disease asks big questions of whether the health service is ready to use them. 
rugs have to be given early in the disease before too much damage to the brain is done, whereas most people referred to memory services are in the later stages of the disease. 
requires people coming forward at the earliest signs of memory problems and doctors being able to send them for amyloid tests - either brain scans or spinal fluid analysis - to a determine if they have Alzheimer's or another form of dementia. At the moment only 1-2% of people with dementia have such tests. 
Alzheimer's Society says more than 850,000 people in the UK have some form of dementia. More than half have Alzheimer's, but everyone would need testing.
""There's an enormous gulf between current service provision and what we need to do, to deliver disease modifying therapies,"" said Dr Coulthard.
She said that, currently, only those living near big medical centres or paying privately were likely to benefit. 
Scientists also stressed that amyloid was only one part of the complex picture of Alzheimer's disease and should not become the sole focus of therapies.
mmune system and inflammation are heavily involved in the disease and another toxic protein called tau is the one that's found where brain cells are actually dying. 
""That's where I would put my money,"" said Prof Spires-Jones. 
She added: ""I'm very excited we're on the cusp of understanding enough to get a hold of the problem and we should have something that will make a bigger difference in a decade or so.""
Kate Lee, chief executive of Alzheimer's Society charity, called for a 10-year government strategy on dementia to deal with what she called the ""biggest health crisis we face in the UK"".
Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, she also said Lecanemab would not have a ""huge impact"" on those who already live with dementia. 
But she added it should ""make a big difference"" for future generations.

health	The Scottish hospice struggling with the true cost of living	"Cost of living is a phrase that holds much more weight at Strathcarron Hospice in Denny.
Its web page states its ethos of helping people with life-limiting conditions to live and die well.
But soaring energy bills, inflation and rising costs of medical products mean it is getting increasingly difficult to maintain services at their current level. 
Without meaningful financial intervention from the NHS, bosses will have to consider making cuts.
Irene McKie, Strathcarron's chief executive, said: ""We always pay our staff the same rates as the NHS because we want to get the best people possible.""
But the hard fought pay rise on its way to some NHS staff, although well-deserved, would add about £600,000 to the hospice running costs. 
Ms McKie added: ""That is massive. We would need to find most of that money ourselves.
""We are a very specialist service with an incredibly fantastic range of staff. 
""And we pay for them with coffee mornings and 10k runs and ladies lunches. It seems ridiculous that's the way we have to fund the service.""
Currently one third of the hospice is government funded. NHS Forth Valley contribute £2.6m to running costs while NHS Lanarkshire contributes £550,000. 
Strathcarron has to fundraise £14,632 of its own money every day to keep the doors open.
Ms McKie said: ""We, in theory, get 50% of our funding from the NHS but in practice, it's 32% because it hasn't kept up with the rate of inflation.""
Since Ms McKie took over as chief executive of the hospice, the number of patients they care for in the community has doubled. 
However, NHS funding has not increased, meaning the services the hospice team has spent a number of years building are now at risk as people are less able to donate.
Ms McKie told BBC Scotland: ""We're now getting in to the situation where we're having to keep dipping into the bank account to keep going and we can't keep doing it because eventually we wouldn't be a viable charity or business.""
Strathcarron Hospice said it had tried to enter into talks with Forth Valley health board in October to review the level of funding it receives - something which was last done in 2006. 
Ms McKie said: ""We have said we're going to have to make big decisions if we don't get additional funding. We actually haven't had a response to that.
""The conversation we want with the health board is, what is it you don't want us to do? 
""Because they actually want us to do everything we're doing - they just hope we magically find the funding for it ourselves.""
re are 24 beds at Strathcarron Hospice but at any one time they look after around 400 people at home in the community, anywhere from Callander to Kilsyth. 
Paula McLaren is a community clinical nurse specialist. She visits people in their homes and advises on everything from pain management to financial support. The latter is something she is having to do much more regularly. 
She said: ""I saw a lady yesterday who has an advanced cancer, and at first I was met with a bit of hostility. 
""Her family were really frustrated, really anxious at the situation they're living in. They just don't feel like they've had very much support in the year and a half since her diagnosis. 
""She had overwhelming, really complex pain, nausea and horrible physical symptoms. But that wasn't her main concern.
""It was really her financial worries. How is she going to heat her home or pay her bills? And that's a worry for a lot of my patients at the moment.""
Paula was able to organise financial help and ensure she could stay at home as she wanted.
She added: ""At the end of the visit her husband actually fell asleep. He said: 'I'm just so relieved that someone is actually here to help my wife and answer all of these big questions we've had for so long'.""
Rosanne Verhees was diagnosed with metastatic Breast Cancer in 2014, which had spread to her bones. She is also worried about money.
She told BBC Scotland: ""I'm terrified the money is going to run out because I need to keep myself warm, I'm always really cold with my treatment. It's a huge worry.""
Rosanne said navigating a diagnosis like hers is terrifying but the care she's received from the hospice since 2016 has made difficult days a bit brighter. 
""Having them in my life, knowing you can get the visits and you have the support of different services, makes me think of myself as really lucky,"" she added.
As budgets continue to be squeezed and people have less money in their pockets to donate to charities, the level of need and the level of care required remains unchanged. 
Clackmannanshire, Stirling and Falkirk Health and Social Care Partnerships (HSCP) and NHS Forth Valley said they had a high regard for the palliative care services provided by Strathcarron Hospice and the positive impact this had in providing care and support for families at times of great need.
A spokesman said: ""We appreciate the financial pressures the hospice is facing and have supported the hospice to access substantial Covid funding support over the past two years.
""The Hospice has also received significant levels of additional funding as part of our local Service Level Agreement (SLA) most recently during the 2021/22 financial year in a bid to address a range of budget pressures. 
""A further interim funding uplift was provided in the current financial year which will be reviewed and updated once the NHS pay rise has been agreed.""
uthorities said that they would continue to seek ""open and active"" dialogue with Strathcarron.
kesman added: ""Recognising that all partners are experiencing, and will continue to face, significant financial challenges going forward, we remain committed to working with the hospice acknowledging the constraints of resources available."""	/news/uk-scotland-63951590
health	Cancer survivor thanks comic Ed Byrne for 'life saving' joke	"A woman who discovered she had bowel cancer after watching comedian Ed Byrne's stand-up show has thanked him for his ""life-saving joke"".
Jackie Kaines Lang, 60, said Byrne's routine about going to see a GP about diarrhoea had resonated with her.
fter seeing the show in Berwick, Northumberland, Ms Kaines Lang went to see her doctor which led to her being treated seven years ago.
Byrne, who lost his brother to cancer, said doctors deserved the credit.
Ms Kaines Lang said the Irish comic told a ""long, convoluted joke"" which involved a ""reference to someone going to see their GP because they had a long-standing case of diarrhoea"".
She said: ""I thought 'do you know I have had diarrhoea for over three weeks, I ought to get this checked out, the guy's right'.
""The very next day I did phone my GP.""
She was later diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer.
Ms Kaines Lang had been unable to thank Byrne in person for the ""life-saving joke"", but BBC Radio Newcastle surprised her with a video call with the comedian.
Mr Byrne, who has appeared on numerous TV shows including Mock the Week and Live at the Apollo, said: ""I am very happy the whole thing has had a very happy resolution.
""Of all the routines I have had to suddenly be out there [in the media], why did it have to be the one about me having diarrhoea for three weeks?
""I would stop short of calling it a life-saving routine. Let me at least share the credit with the doctors, I would say they did most of the life saving.""
Ms Kaines Lang, who has written a blog post about her diagnosis for Bowel Cancer UK, urged other people to see a doctor if they have concerns.
""It's about knowing your body and if things aren't normal then go and get them checked out,"" she advised.
According to the NHS, common symptoms for bowel cancer include:

health	NHS Wales: Grange Hospital A&E needs urgent improvement - HIW	"Urgent improvements are being called for at a new south Wales hospital's emergency department.
Healthcare Inspectorate Wales' (HIW) main concern is poor patient flow through the Grange Hospital in Cwmbran, which opened only two years ago.
rns about potential cross contamination in the ""Covid corridor"", out of date medicines and the security of harmful substances.
Aneurin Bevan health board said it welcomed the findings. 
Staff told inspectors they could not always deliver the standard of care they wanted to, due to increasing pressures and demand on the department.
report mirrors concerns raised in a previous inspection of Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, where patients were found sitting on bins in waiting areas.
Grange, Wales' newest hospital, which opened on 17 November, 2020, has come under heavy criticism.
A report by the Royal College of Physicians in 2021 found that some trainee doctors and consultants were scared to come to work, with chronic understaffing and excessive workloads.
Earlier this year the hospital's medical director said the site needed to expand because demand had been higher than anticipated.
rd said it had acknowledged and responded to concerns raised, adding: ""We're also pleased to see that the report highlights the hard work and dedication of our staff during periods of extreme pressure on our services, during which patients were treated with courtesy, dignity and respect.""
's report paints a more positive picture of the running of the hospital, with staff feeling supported and patients praising the medical teams and their treatment.
However, the flow of patients through the hospital is hindering care.
Inspectors said until it can be improved, ""the health board will find it challenging to address a number of our concerns"".
One anonymous member of staff said patient flow was ""a national problem"" and believed there was ""good evidence that patients come to harm"".
used the analogy, ""If the bath is full and overflowing, don't make a bigger bath, sort out the plug hole"".
Patient Lee Pomroy echoed these comments.
He said: ""I've been there about three or four times. The hospital is fine, it's just the waiting times... half the time it's not their fault, it's just when people come in they have nowhere to put them.""
Lesley Hardy, 64, said: ""They did a Covid test and then they put me into an observation ward but that was really awful. There were four chairs in each corner of the room and they were hard chairs, there was no recliners so you couldn't sleep. 
""When I asked for a pillow just to put my head, because the pain was so bad, they said they didn't have the pillow in the actual hospital that I could have.""
Another patient, Kirsten Lapping, said: ""The patients got offered tea, coffee, sandwiches twice while I was there. The seats are not comfortable, but they never are. Relatives are asked to leave a couple of times so there was room for patients.
""There were so many people in there. I think they made an announcement there were 150 people in A&E at one point while we were there. So the wait was understandable.
""It was frustrating, I'm not going to lie but I understand that they are understaffed.""
Across Wales - and the rest of the UK - a shortage of staff in social care means patients are unable to be safely discharged from hospitals, despite being medically well enough.
means beds are unavailable for those arriving at A&E needing to be admitted to hospital.
In turn, this causes longer waits for patients in the emergency department.
Inspectors noted the waiting area at The Grange was very small and unfit for purpose.
gthy waits for patients caused some to be ""frustrated and sometimes angry"", though ""the majority were very complimentary about the staff"".
Some patients told inspectors they had sat on the floor because of a lack of space.
report said there could be more than 50 patients in the waiting room, with the majority physically or mentally unwell, posing ""a significant risk"" which ""placed stress and risk on the staff members"".
Inspectors spent three days at the hospital during August.
About three-quarters of patients will be treated in their own rooms with ensuite facilities
During August 7,530 people turned up at The Grange hospital - making it the second busiest A&E in Wales that month. 
Nearly one in five patients waited longer than 12 hours during that month. 
On the inspectors' first day, 14 ambulances were waiting outside, with one patient waiting18 hours to be ""offloaded"" from the ambulance to hospital staff because of an infection control risk.
Patients were assessed and triaged to reduce risks, but efforts to free up ambulances were sometimes hindered by the lack of space in the hospital.
In response to the HIW report, Welsh government said it was ""providing an additional £25m this year to transform urgent and emergency care services across Wales, with Aneurin Bevan UHB receiving £3m"".
In a statement it added that it had ""provided an additional £260k to the health board for improvements to its emergency department waiting areas this winter"".
""I fully accept there are mounting pressures on the NHS across Wales, but the problem seems particularly acute in Gwent where patient complaints at The Grange continue to mount,"" said Monmouth MP and Welsh Secretary David TC Davies. 
He added: ""We are being let down by those in charge who are pretending the current situation is acceptable when it is clearly not."""	/news/uk-wales-63571316
health	Shrewsbury hospital rolls out ambulance delay scheme	"A scheme aiming to cut ambulance waiting times has launched at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital.
me of the longest delays in the region, tying up ambulances outside A&E and preventing staff from responding to 999 calls.
Shrewsbury's Ambulance Decision Area allow paramedics to care for patients while they wait to be handed over to hospital staff.
It means other ambulance crews can get back on the road.
West Midlands Ambulance Service (WMAS) has already trialled the scheme at three Birmingham hospitals and said it had seen a ""significant impact"".
Another decision area is also set to open soon at Telford's Princess Royal Hospital.
Across the West Midlands in September 2019, the service lost a total of 6,259 hours through ambulances being stuck at hospitals waiting to hand over patients,  a report revealed.
In September 2022, the equivalent figure was 36,750 hours.
Following a trial of the initiative at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Good Hope Hospital and Heartlands Hospital, WMAS was approached by the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust in October to set up the scheme at its two sites.
""This is another example of the two organisations doing everything possible to reduce handover delays, which ultimately, will benefit patients,"" a WMAS spokesperson said.
""We have worked incredibly hard with Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals to get the scheme up and running as quickly as possible after the funding was identified.""
Ambulance Decision Areas are also staffed by healthcare assistants with extra training.

health	RSV and flu surge in US ahead of holidays – what to know	"With the holiday season approaching in the US, doctors are urging people to exercise caution to avoid a surge in common and potentially dangerous winter viruses.
US is facing a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with some hospitals opening extra beds to treat patients, while there are concerns about other illnesses such as flu.
Winnie Chow, a parent to 10-month-old Cooper, took her son to hospital earlier this month after he had been vomiting and coughing for several days. He spent four days there recovering from RSV.
""I was in tears,"" said Ms Chow, who lives in Hackensack, New Jersey. ""For him to be there for more than a day was very scary.""
Ms Chow is one of many parents who have had to seek care for an unwell child as winter viruses arrive earlier and with more severity than in recent years - a trend experts say could persist as people gather indoors for the winter holidays.
""We do worry when people start gathering,"" said Richard Malley, a senior physician with the Division of Infectious Disease at Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts. 
""When you have multiple generations mingling together, you have an increased risk of transmission from someone who is handling the virus pretty well to someone who may not handle it well at all.""
RSV can manifest like a common cold in adults, but can prove dangerous for some young children.
Symptoms include a cough, congestion, runny nose and fever as well as wheezing in young infants, according to Rachel Orscheln, the director of ambulatory paediatric infectious diseases at St Louis Children's Hospital.
For the most vulnerable, RSV can lead to bronchiolitis, a condition that includes a build-up of inflammation in the lungs and difficulty breathing. There is no vaccine for RSV but scientists are working on developing one.
It can be difficult to distinguish between RSV, coronavirus and the flu because the respiratory viruses include many of the same symptoms and usually peak in winter.
But physicians can use tests to diagnose patients to determine the best course of treatment.
Parents should reach out to their child's healthcare provider if they begin to have concerns, especially if they are experiencing worsening symptoms, difficulty breathing or are struggling to drink fluids, said Sonali Advani, an assistant professor of medicine at Duke University's Division of Infectious Diseases.
Experts say protective measures like social distancing, mask wearing and other hygiene practices from the coronavirus pandemic likely shielded some children from exposure to the flu and their first RSV infection, which most children normally experience by age two. 
means they may now be more vulnerable to infection.
An earlier RSV season followed by more severe flu infections has created a ""perfect storm"" that is ""flooding our paediatric capacity"", said Daniel Rauch, the chief of Paediatric Hospital Medicine at Tufts Medicine in Massachusetts. 
He told the BBC a reduction in hospital beds for children during the coronavirus pandemic, which was intended to make space for adults who are more vulnerable to severe illness from Covid, had worsened the current problem.
Some experts said they were not optimistic the issues would resolve soon, as close contact during the the winter holiday season could offer more opportunities for viral transmission. 
Getting vaccinated against Covid and the flu offers one of the best forms of protection against some of the respiratory illnesses that are circulating, experts told the BBC.
US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci said the flu jab was ""well matched"" to the circulating strain, while White House Covid co-ordinator Dr Ashish Jha urged Americans to ""make protecting our loved ones an important part of the conversation we have around the Thanksgiving table"".
king a rapid test for Covid on the morning of winter holiday celebrations adds another potential layer of protection, Dr Malley said. 
He added that parents could also make sure any person serving food during large family gatherings is symptom-free and handling the food in a hygienic manner. 
Handwashing and avoiding touching your face and mouth are also advised.
""If you're sick, maybe skip the family gathering this year,"" Dr Rauch said. ""Don't bring it to everybody else.""
Parents and children should also wear masks during travel on planes, trains and other public transportation and could do so during gatherings where they are unsure others are vaccinated, Dr Rauch said. 
In the meantime, Amy Knight, the president of the Children's Hospital Association which represents more than 220 hospitals across the US, said paediatric hospitals were ""getting creative"" and finding extra space for patients while working to keep conditions as normal as possible.
""No one likes to have a sick child,"" she said.
""It's an incredibly stressful time, but many have also been understanding in recognising that the hospital has a big challenge and a big job, and they're grateful to be there and grateful to have the care.""

health	Daughter creates design after mum's mastectomy	"A woman has created a new device to help women recovering from a mastectomy after her mother asked her to.
Sam Jackman, from Calstock, Cornwall, came up with the design after her mum had a mastectomy due to breast cancer and found her prothesis uncomfortable.
Working with a small team in her garage, the 39-year-old came up with a silicone shape that fits into clothing.
Staff at the Primrose Breast Care Centre at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth also helped with advice.
Susan Jackman said the NHS prosthesis she was given after her single mastectomy was hot, sweaty and awkward to wear and her daughter wanted to make her recovery more comfortable.
Miss Jackman, who co-founded Boost six years ago, said she realised there was an urgent need to get a lighter, open-structured and ""funky breast form"".
Listen to a BBC Radio Cornwall interview with Sam Jackson and her mother.
Dr Jim Steel, a consultant breast radiologist at the Primrose Breast Care Centre, said after a mastectomy some women opt for surgical reconstruction, others wear a prosthesis and some decide not to have either.
He said it was unfortunate women were asked to make those choices ""at totally the wrong time"" when they have just learnt they have cancer.
ultant added he hoped it was the beginning of a trend where women will have ""more and more choice"".

health	NHS care backlog push at serious risk - National Audit Office	"kle long waits in hospital treatment and cancer care in England by 2025 is at serious risk, the spending watchdog says.
National Audit Office report warned inflation and other pressures on the NHS could undermine the push.
uded a lack of staff and hospital beds, which was affecting productivity, the watchdog said.
But NHS bosses said they could overcome the challenges and the health service was on track to hit its targets.
NHS England and the government have set a series of targets over the next three years.
ude: 
NAO report comes as the chancellor prepares to set out his tax and spending plans in his Autumn Statement on Thursday.
Cuts to public spending are likely but Health Secretary Steve Barclay has strongly hinted the NHS will receive more money.
Its budget was already due to grow by nearly £5bn next year.
But NHS England has warned that still leaves a £7bn shortfall, because of inflationary pressures.
NAO said inflation had chipped away at how far the money set aside for backlogs would go.
Its report noted the NHS was still doing fewer planned treatments, such as knee and hip replacements, than before the pandemic.  
goal is to increase them by nearly a third.
reation of a network of community surgical and diagnostic hubs to test and treat more patients had had less impact than expected, it said, due to:
Continued high rates of sickness were also a problem.
A lack of support in the community meant most patients ready to be discharged could not be, limiting the number of treatments possible.
umber of fully qualified GPs was falling and there was limited evidence the plan for them to provide support and advice in the community rather than referring patients on to specialists in hospital would work.
NAO head Gareth Davies said the NHS needed more support and to be challenged in areas where it was making insufficient progress.
""There are significant risks to the delivery of the plan to reduce long waits for elective and cancer care services by 2025,"" he added.
A NHS England spokesman said the health service was facing challenges but remained ""on track"" to deliver on its goals."	/news/health-63654408
health	Gloucester Dementia Choir helps unlock memories and words	"A new choir for people with dementia aims to ""utilise the power of music"" to ease depression and anxiety amongst those suffering from the condition.
Gloucester Dementia Choir was launched on Saturday with a special Christmas session offering a safe environment for socialising, singing and celebrating music.
Jacqueline Fitall has dementia and said the first session was ""lovely"".
""I do forget things sometimes- but I absolutely love singing,"" she said.
""There are some really nice people here, and I have really enjoyed myself- it has been a nice experience,"" she added.
r was set up by the Gloucestershire Academy of Music which said it was building on the work it already performs in care homes across the county.
Jenny Harrison and Becky Chevis, from Gloucestershire, said they decided to launch the choir after they found a gap in music resources for those with dementia.
""Music evokes a lot of emotions, and it allows those living with the condition to reminisce,"" said Ms Harrison.
""When you play a song that they used to listen to forty years ago, they come to life, remember those words and find their voices to sing those words.
""Music is a really powerful tool for people with dementia and we want to utilise that.""
r is not only encouraging individuals with dementia to get involved, but also their families and carers too.
From 13 January the choir will begin offering sessions every two weeks.
Ms Chevis said she found the first session ""moving"".
""There was someone who sang a solo on the spot today - it nearly made me cry,"" she said.
""There is some amazing research about music and dementia- we know it can help ease depression and anxiety amongst those living with the condition.
""The first session has really proven that music can make people happy and provided that lovely feeling of being together with each other.
""It has been an absolute success and we look forward to the new year.""

Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said a ""large number of very poorly people"" were turning up at A&E with flu and injuries associated with the cold weather. 
rust said the demand was ""causing very long waits"" for patients.
Despite some cancelled operations, day surgeries went ahead, hospital bosses said.
Nottingham University Hospitals medical director, Dr Keith Girling, said a number of planned operations, where patients require a stay in hospital, will be postponed to prioritise patients with the most urgent need.
""We regret that this will impact on patients who were due to receive planned care over the next few days and sincerely apologise to all those affected,"" he said. 
""These appointments will be rescheduled as soon as possible. If we have not contacted you directly, please attend your appointment as planned.
""Our staff are working tirelessly during a period of exceptional pressure on our hospitals and I want to thank them for their continued hard work and dedication to our patients.""
NUH critical incident comes in a week during which two NHS strikes are planned.
Royal College of Nursing members are walking out on 20 December and East Midlands Ambulance Service is striking on 21 December.
Dr Girling told the Local Democracy Reporting Service that A&E was ""one in one out"".
""We have got a number of patients in the corridor and that's far from ideal,"" he said. 
""Very sadly, we have had to defer some operations today because we have had to use beds in some surgical wards for medical patients.""
Speaking of the strike action, he added: ""It's going to be a very difficult week, we are absolutely sighted of that.
""The teams are doing a fantastic job, they are working hard to give patients the best care they can.

health	QEQM Margate: Revamped A&E department opens doors to patients	"mergency department at one of the biggest hospitals in the South East has been expanded and modernised after a multimillion-pound investment.
Patients at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital (QEQM) in Margate will see new, larger treatment areas from Wednesday.
revamp includes a new waiting area and children's emergency department.
Jo Williams, head of nursing for urgent and emergency care, said staff were ""excited"".
mprovements are part of a £30m investment in the QEQM and the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, which are run by East Kent Hospitals trust.
It was criticised last year by inspectors who said the design of the buildings did not always keep patients safe.
With up to 280 people arriving on average each day at the QEQM, it is hoped the changes will drive down waiting times.
Ms Williams said: ""It should help with the flow and the demand, which will make things slightly easier.
""It won't combat all of the problems, but it will certainly help.""
first phase of development also includes larger treatment areas for adults, dedicated areas for patients with mental health needs and new staff facilities.
Ms Williams said new private booths would give patients ""privacy and dignity"".

rust is planning to install more heat pumps to heat the rest of the site with the help of a £21m government grant.
It said the move to renewable energy will reduce the amount of carbon produced to heat the hospital by about 97% and save 3,715 tonnes of carbon a year going into the atmosphere.

health	Staffordshire mother backs call for paid leave after miscarriage	"""I would sit at my desk, just reading an email and just start crying.""
Jess Hughes has lost five babies, including miscarrying twice and three ectopic pregnancies. 
She was diagnosed with PTSD - Post Traumatic Stress Disorder - after surgery following her first ectopic pregnancy in November 2016, when she had a fallopian tube removed.
""People knew why I hadn't been at work [after miscarrying] but people didn't know what to say; it was a bit silent, people distanced themselves because they didn't want to have the awkward conversations,"" said Mrs Hughes, from Penkridge in Staffordshire.
Although she had a month of paid leave from work following the first baby she and her husband Ross lost, she had to take statutory sick pay of about £80 a week following the other four losses their family experienced.
She said she was supporting a private members' bill brought by SNP MP Angela Crawley, which was due to have its second reading in the House of Commons on Friday, calling on the government to give women and their partners the legal right to take three days' paid leave if a pregnancy ends before 24 weeks.
MP first introduced the bill to Parliament in June last year.
government introduced paid parental leave for the loss of a baby after 24 weeks in April 2020.
It entitles a parent to two weeks' leave paid at £151.97 a week, or 90% of their average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.
Some employers have already decided to introduce paid leave themselves.
Mrs Hughes, who is now pregnant with a boy who would be her third child with daughters Ruby, aged four, and May, who is 17 months old, said it was important to have time off to cope with what has happened.
""It's not like in films,"" she said.
""You don't just go to the toilet and bleed and you are not pregnant anymore.
""It does need to be able to be spoken about, it's happening to a lot of women every single day.
""It's so important. You need the time off to get yourself back to good health. You are still losing your child - it's a bereavement.
""Three days is still not enough [paid leave]; there's not a miscarriage that lasts three days but it's a start and it's a brilliant start if it can get passed.""

health	UK nurses strike: NHS worker says profession is at 'crisis point'	"A health worker says nursing is ""at crisis point"" as she takes part in the biggest strike in NHS history.
Nearly 100 people were outside the Bristol Royal Infirmary (BRI) as part of a call by union members for a 19% pay rise.
wo minor injury and illness units have been closed in Gloucestershire as a result of the strike.
UK government said the Royal College of Nursing's (RCN) pay rise demand was unaffordable.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the government was ""hugely grateful"" for the work nurses do.
Nurses are striking across England, Wales and Northern Ireland but continue to provide life-preserving and some urgent care.
Some routine surgery and other planned treatments have been disrupted.
Paula Burne, 58, who works at the BRI, said she had been a nurse for nearly 40 years and that she was worried about the future of nursing.
""It is time for us to make a stand, to protect our nurses and most importantly patient care,"" she said.
""Nurses are leaving in the thousands, so all that experience and expertise is being lost.
""Striking is unprecedented in our profession - it really means something - we want the government to listen to us,"" she added.
RCN union is calling for nurses to be given a pay rise of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which was 14.2% in October.
government previously announced average pay increases of 4.5% for doctors and 4.75% for other NHS staff - including nurses.
Marie Dixon, 39, who works at the BRI as a nurse said ""voices need to be heard"".
""For many years, we have been ignored and expected to just get on with it - but it's at crisis point now,"" she said.
""We can't give the care we want to and I feel like it's dangerous for us and for the public,"" she added.
At the picket line in Swindon, Nichola Ashby, the deputy director of the RCN, described the strike as ""a very sad day"".
""We didn't want to take action - but we were left with no choice,"" Ms Ashby said.
""I believe the public is behind us all the way - they understand that this is about making sure we can deliver safe and effective care,"" she added.
Minor injury and illness units in Tewkesbury and Stroud have been shut during the strikes, while another in Lydney is operating with a reduced service.
government said this year's pay increase reflected the independent NHS Pay Review Body's recommendations. 
NHS staff also had a 3% rise in 2021 - in recognition of their work during the pandemic - while the rest of the public sector had a pay freeze, it said.

health	'Miracle' baby born to Evesham couple diagnosed with cancer	"A baby born to a couple who both had chemotherapy during the pregnancy has been described as a miracle.
James Jefferson-Loveday was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma last December, just months before his wife Bethany was diagnosed with a similar cancer at 21 weeks pregnant.
His diagnosis had led to the couple from Worcestershire trying for a baby. 
After treatment, baby Heidi was born healthy, while both parents are now in remission, doctors say.
Dr Salim Shafeek, who treated the couple from Evesham, said: ""The combination of being pregnant and having high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma is exceptionally rare, and Bethany is the first case of this I've treated in my 25 years as a consultant haematologist.""
Mrs Jefferson-Loveday began feeling unwell during her first trimester, while her husband was still undergoing chemotherapy treatment for his lymphoma.
She put how she was feeling down to her pregnancy and believed a lump she had found was a cyst.
Eventually seeking medical help, she was then told the devastating news.
""I will never forget the moment I was given my diagnosis,"" Mrs Jefferson-Loveday said.
""I remember questioning how this was possible as my husband was undergoing treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma at the time.""
She talked through all treatment options with a consultant obstetrician at Worcestershire Royal Hospital before enduring an intense course of six cycles of chemotherapy, the hospital trust said.
Dr Shafeek said they could not use stronger treatment, or delay chemotherapy, which had to be finished by 35 weeks to enable her to recover enough for childbirth.
""After every chemotherapy I felt a sense of celebration that I had another one under my belt and was closer to having my baby,"" she said.
Mrs Jefferson-Loveday said her husband ""completely understood what I was going through"" as he continued his treatment and also shaved his head when she lost her hair.
She eventually had a Caesarean section to safely deliver their baby daughter Heidi, who was born completely healthy with no adverse effects, the trust said.
""James and I both agree that Heidi's birthday was the best day of our lives. It is the happiest I have ever felt,"" Mrs Jefferson-Loveday said.
""Dr Shafeek described Heidi as a miracle and reflecting back on the past year, he is absolutely right.""
She described the team at the hospital as like family.
""All manner of scenarios had been mapped out to ensure a plan was in place to manage any risks should they arise. It's difficult to put into words how grateful we are as a family for everything they have done for us,"" she added.

health	Scotland's largest health union 'rejects pay offer'	"Members of Scotland's largest health union are believed to have rejected the latest pay offer for NHS staff.
BBC Scotland understands 61% of Unison members voted to turn down the £2,205 pay uplift with an official announcement expected on Tuesday.
It is likely the union will now ballot its 50,000 members on taking industrial action.
Scottish health secretary Humza Yousaf has warned he does not have more money for pay deals.
Other health unions have already rejected the pay deal and backed strike action, with ambulance workers planning a 26-hour walkout later this month. 
But Unison had suspended its strike ballot of NHS staff last month to consult on a revised pay offer from the Scottish government.
Scottish government's pay offer is for a flat rate rise of £2,205 per worker backdated to April.
It means an average salary increase of 7% with the lowest paid gaining more than 11% and qualified nursing staff receiving up to 8.45%.
Unison's rejection of this offer comes as GMB Scotland said its members in the Scottish Ambulance Service would walk out on 28 November until the following day.
union said meetings would be held with management to ensure appropriate staffing levels for critical care.
GMB Scotland organiser Karen Leonard said the strikes were a direct response to the Scottish government for ""failing to give front-line workers the pay rise that they deserve"". 
Unite also announced that about 1,500 Scottish Ambulance Service staff, including paramedics, would take industrial action on 25 November.
xpected to take the form of measures such as work-to-rule and an overtime ban.
Royal College of Nursing and health workers in two other unions have also voted for a combination of strike and industrial action this winter.
Scottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has said he does not have more money for pay deals.
Mr Yousaf and his Welsh counterpart have written to the UK government to ask for more funding to help avoid strike action.
He told BBC Scotland that the UK had a ""moral obligation"" to give the Scottish government more money.
""They are the architects of this cost crisis,"" he said.

Western Health Trust has announced a temporary halt to emergency general surgery at the facility. 
Professor Mark Taylor told the BBC most patients would not be impacted.
Speaking to Sunday Politics he said ""we have to look at the facts"" in relation to the withdrawal of services.
Western Trust said it was necessary to protect the public's safety after it had problems recruiting surgical staff.
Despite saying the move was temporary, the trust did not say when it expected emergency general surgery would resume.
mergency department and other services including obstetrics will continue to operate as normal.
In a further move it has been confirmed the hospital is to become Northern Ireland's third elective surgical hub.
Sinn Fein's Colm Gildernew called it an ""unplanned collapse"", while UUP councillor Diane Armstrong said it was ""a dark day that affects everybody, man, woman and child"".
Prof Taylor said he agreed it was an unplanned collapse and that consultant surgeons did not want to work in SWAH delivering emergency general surgery ""for several factors"".
""There is no such thing as the general surgeon any more. General surgery has become very sub-specialised. We know from all the evidence that centres of high volume with all the facets surrounding the delivery of emergency surgery, you get better outcomes,"" he added.
He said the people of Fermanagh had ""every right to be anxious"", however he assured viewers this is not a closure of the emergency department, nor a removal of acute hospital status.
""This is the four to five people per day who currently come to SWAH with an acute general surgical problem, only one of those may require an operation. They will not get the operation currently in the SWAH because of the manpower crisis and they will have to transfer,"" he explained.
""In general surgical true emergencies - appendicitis, a bowel obstruction - the time is not imminent, it's not seconds or minutes. 
""Quite often throughout Northern Ireland it is several hours before you get to theatre without any harm or consequence,"" he said.
""I think we've got to dial down the noise to suggest fear to the people of Fermanagh.""
Also appearing on the programme, DUP's Deborah Erskine said she thought the creation of an elective surgical hub would secure the future of the hospital. But she said she was concerned by how the removal of general surgery had been messaged to the public.
""The Western Trust hasn't levelled with the public locally to say what is going on,"" she added. 
""People are angry, frustrated, they're worried, they're concerned. As a public representative I do share concerns... what I want to see is the best outcomes for patients and staff.""
Colm Gildernew said he supported properly planned transformation of services at SWAH but it has to be ""on the basis of co-production with people in health, communities, workers, all of those"".
Ms Erskine also told the programme that she was ""very concerned"" about the potential loss of GP services elsewhere in Country Fermanagh.
Maple Healthcare in Lisnaskea said it was handing back its contract to the Department of Health. 
Confirming the news on Saturday, the department reassured patients that services would continue at the practice for the next six months.
""The thing I'm most concerned about is that I had staff who got in touch with me yesterday who did not know this news until it broke on the media."" 
She said she wanted to establish the facts about what is happening, adding pressure on GP services was not a ""new issue"".
Mr Gildernew said there was an urgent need to find a solution. 
""We have six months and what we need is a health minister and an executive,"" he added."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63694685
health	Ambulance Strikes: Paramedic says Covid can't be blamed for NHS pressures	"A paramedic who has joined thousands of ambulance workers on strike, has said ""Covid isn't to blame anymore"" for the pressures the NHS is facing.
Nicola Griffiths joined the picket line on Forge Lane, Stoke-on-Trent, because she wants better conditions for staff and patients as well as pay.
Unions want pay increases to keep up with the rising cost of living.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay said a further pay increase would take money from frontline services.
NHS England says emergency care will continue to be provided.
unions representing ambulance workers have not set a specific wage figure but argue any offer needs to be high enough to prevent a recruitment crisis.
Ms Griffiths said the NHS had ""completely broken down"".
""It is completely underfunded, nurses, porters, cleaners, everyone who works for the NHS doesn't get what they deserve,"" she added.
Wages are not going up to correspond with inflation, she said.
ramedic said that she had been on shift when some patients had to go into four different ambulances as they waited outside of the hospital.
""We are all finishing really really late because of shift change, we have to wait for another crew to pick us up and swap ambulances.""
On one of the worse days, delays in patient handovers saw 25 out of the county's 57 ambulances waiting outside Royal Stoke University Hospital.
Mr Barclay said most ambulance staff have received a pay rise of at least 4%, taking average earnings to £47,000. A further pay increase would mean taking money from frontline services, he added.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has insisted he will not back down against striking workers. He has said the best way to help the workforce would be to reduce inflation as quickly as possible.

health	'Leap forward' in tailored cancer medicine	"People with untreatable cancers have had their immune system redesigned to attack their own tumours.
xperimental study involved only 16 patients, but has been called a ""leap forward"" and a ""powerful"" demonstration of the potential of such technology.
Each person had a treatment developed just for them, which targeted the specific weak spots in their tumour. 
It is too early to fully assess the therapy's effectiveness and it is expensive and time-consuming. 
work focuses on a part of the immune system called T-cells, which patrol the body and inspect other cells for problems. 
use proteins - called receptors - to effectively sniff out signs of infection or deviant cells that have become cancerous. 
Cancers can be tricky for T-cells to spot. A virus is distinctly different to the human body, but cancers are more subtle because they are a corrupted version of our own cells. 
f the therapy is to boost levels of these cancer-spotting T-cells. It has to be tailored to each patient as each tumour is unique. 
w it works:
ransforming T-cells into a form that can hunt cancer requires considerable genetic manipulation to both remove the genetic instructions for building their old receptors, and give them the instructions for the new ones. 
It was made possible by tremendous advances in the gene-editing technology Crispr, which acts like a pair of molecular scissors - allowing scientists to easily manipulate DNA. The researchers who developed Crispr won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2020.
rial involved people with colon, breast or lung cancers that had failed to respond to other treatments. 
udy was designed to test the safety and feasibility of the technology, and showed the modified cells were finding their way into the tumour. 
ued to get worse in 11 patients, but stabilised in the other five. However, it will take larger studies to work out the correct dose and how effective it really is.
""This is a leap forward in developing a personalised treatment for cancer,"" said Dr Antoni Ribas, one of the researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, who tested the approach developed by the company Pact Pharma.
results were presented at a meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer and published simultaneously in the journal Nature.
Dr Manel Juan, head of the immunology service at Clinic Hospital in Barcelona, said it was ""extraordinary work"" and ""undoubtedly one of the most advanced in the field"".
He added: ""It opens the door to using this personalised [approach] in many types of cancer and potentially in many other diseases.""
Prof Waseem Qasim, who has given life-saving designer immune systems at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said it was a ""powerful early demonstration of what might be possible with newer techniques"".
Dr Astero Klampatsa, from the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said the study was ""important"" but warned that the ""time, labour and expense involved"" were ""huge"".

health	Empty Southend care beds are criminal says health boss	"A care home manager said it was ""criminal"" that more hospital patients were not being discharged into empty beds within the community.
Michael Daley, who is also chair of the South Essex Care and Health Association, said he did not understand why some homes were not being used.
's records showed there were 45 empty beds across 17 care homes in the area.
Southend Hospital said it worked ""closely with partners"".
""If you are in hospital for weeks on end, I think it's pretty criminal to be honest,"" said Mr Daley, resident manager at Cavell Lodge in Leigh-on-Sea, speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
""I don't understand why they are not being placed in some of these [care homes].
""We're in a crisis situation. Surely it would be better to move somebody elderly into a warm home, which is more homely than keeping them in an acute area blocking the bed for somebody that needs it.""
Southend-on-Sea City Council is reluctant to place patients in care homes rated inadequate or requires improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
's register showed that Melrose House in Southend, rated requires improvement, had 15 unoccupied beds. Abbeyfield care home in Westcliff is rated good but has nine empty beds. 
Latest figures from the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust showed that Southend, Basildon and Broomfield hospitals had an average of 93 patients at the end of each day, during October, who ""no longer met the criteria to reside"".
Southend Hospital CQC inspection, however, concluded that the discharge of surgery and medical care patients was ""in line with good practice"".
Kay Mitchell, the council's Labour cabinet member for adult social care and health integration, said homes rated requires improvement, or below, were found ""to not be delivering good quality care"".
She added that the council kept in contact with homes to find beds for the ""small number"" who needed them.
A spokeswoman for the Mid and South Essex Integrated Care System, on behalf of the Trust, said it ""continues to work closely with partners across the wider health and care system to ensure our patients are discharged safely and when they are clinically ready"".

health	Very challenging winter ahead, Gloucestershire NHS warns	"Health and social care teams in Gloucestershire are preparing for a ""very challenging winter"".
re have been rising levels of seasonal illness across the county as well as patients with complex needs.
NHS Gloucestershire Medical Director Dr Andy Seymour said: ""We are doing all we can to plan in advance and ensure we have a strong plan that strengthens our ability to cope.""
He says teams are already under pressure.
Health and care leaders in the county say their services are working more closely together than ever before to plan ahead and make the best use of available resources. 
Additional national and local funds amounting to more than £12m have also been agreed towards a Winter Plan for Gloucestershire, investing in staff, services, additional beds, ward space and discharge areas.
Measures include GP surgeries working together to offer additional weekday evening and Saturday appointments, hiring additional staff including nurses, health care assistants, and social workers, working in Gloucester and Cheltenham hospitals to help avoid unnecessary hospital stays and to support post-hospital care plans.
Medical director at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Prof Mark Pietroni, said: ""Despite the inevitable pressures that will face health and care services this winter, our priority is ensuring we have the best possible measures in place to maintain high quality care for those most in need.
""However, we are being honest about the scale of the challenge and understand the health and care workforce is already working harder and longer than ever before.
""We are strongly urging people to only call 999 or visit the two A&E Departments if it's a life-threatening situation or a serious injury,"" he added.
ublic are also being urged to follow practical tips to help them stay well wherever possible, and to work alongside health and care services to support the most vulnerable. 
Prof Pietroni said: ""We are asking relatives and carers to do everything they can to work with us to get their loved ones home from hospital as quickly and as safely as possible, with additional support if necessary, from local NHS community services or adult social care teams."""	/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-63746170
health	Strep A: Cheshire pharmacies report amoxicillin and penicillin shortages	"Pharmacies in Cheshire have reported a shortage of antibiotics used to treat strep A. 
Demand for penicillin and amoxicillin has increased recently after a rise in the number of cases in children.
Hannah Sami, who manages a pharmacy in Wilmslow, Cheshire, said she had ""never seen"" so many prescriptions and she had completely run out of amoxicillin. 
government said there were good supplies of antibiotics and stock could be moved around if there were issues. 
UK Health Security Agency figures show 15 children in the UK have died after invasive strep A infections since September.
re have also been 47 deaths from strep A in adults in England.
Most strep A infections are mild but cases of more severe, invasive strep A infections - whilst rare - are rising.
Symptoms like a sore throat or skin infections occur in mild cases, though the bug can also cause scarlet fever. 
It is treated with antibiotics which may also help reduce the risk of complications and spread of the bug.
Dr Andrew Hill, a drugs expert at Liverpool University, said amoxicillin was in ""severe shortage"" worldwide at the moment, with health authorities in France, Spain, Brazil, the United States and Canada all reporting a lack of supply. 
""It seems to be down to a surge in demand as people, especially children, are getting this thing called respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and afterwards, they can have a high risk of bacterial infections,"" he said.
""The estimates are that there are 10 times more cases of scarlet fever this year than there were last year.""
Ms Sami said her pharmacy had run out of amoxicillin and only had two doses of penicillin left.
""For the last week, I've just not been able to get amoxicillin,"" she said.
""We're definitely having supply issues.
""This is not down to normal winter pressures, I've never run out like this before.""
She said she had ""never seen so many amoxicillin prescriptions"" and other pharmacies had experienced similar shortages.
""I don't think anyone has it at all and I'm not aware of any deliveries,"" she added.
A pharmacy in nearby Alderley Edge told the BBC it had similar shortages of amoxicillin.
""It's in real short supply at the moment,"" a representative said.
""Pharmacy managers are calling around asking for it [but] no-one has any.""
Wilmslow GP Dr Fari Ahmad said the picture was similar in other parts of the North West. 
""This is not something I've experienced before"", she said. 
""We've had reassurances from the government that there's not a supply issue, but at the front line, that's not what we're seeing.
""I know lots of our local surgeries are struggling to accommodate everybody.""
She added that her colleagues were ""already spread really thin and this has taken a big toll"".
""We're kind of being left on our own to try and find our way out of this.""
Health Secretary Steve Barclay said on Wednesday that checks within the Department of Health had not revealed an issue with supply of medicines.
He said the level of supply was ""not a concern at the moment"", but stock could be moved around if there was an issue with particular GPs getting supplies.
A Department of Health and Social Care representative said there was ""no supplier shortage of antibiotics available to treat strep A"". 
""As the Secretary of State said, we sometimes have surges for products and increased demand means some pharmacies are having difficulties obtaining certain antibiotics,"" they said.
""We are working urgently with manufactures and wholesalers to explore what can be done to expedite deliveries and bring forward stock they have to help ensure it gets to where it's needed, to meet demand as quickly as possible and support access to these vital medicines.""

Members agreed to earmark £800,000 to subsidise visits for anyone under the age of 18, as part of the 2023 budget.
Currently appointments are only free for children living in income support households.
minister warned if the move led to an increase in appointments it could lead to GPs becoming overwhelmed.
In the vote 24 members supported a call for the funding from Reform Jersey Deputy Carina Alves, while 22 were against. 
Ms Alves told the States: ""Children do not have their own autonomous access to income regardless of their family's economic background.
""All children deserve this, and all children are vulnerable.""However Deputy Karen Wilson, health minister said: ""We simply do not have any sense of what the demand might be until we do the proper work on this.
""One of the aspects that we do need to be mindful of, is that if that demand increases GPs will be overwhelmed, and in actual fact children will not have access in a planned and organised way.""

health	Covid in China: People rush to book travel as borders finally reopen	"Chinese people have rushed to book overseas travel after Beijing announced it would reopen its borders next month.
Passport applications for Chinese citizens wishing to travel internationally will resume from 8 January, the immigration administration said.
It follows an announcement on Monday that ended almost three years of strict quarantine rules for arrivals.
ravel sites have since reported a spike in traffic.
But Chinese tourists will not have unfettered access to all countries.
Officials in the US are considering new restrictions on travellers from China due to concerns about a surge in cases and a lack of transparency from the Chinese government.
""There are mounting concerns in the international community on the ongoing Covid-19 surges in China and the lack of transparent data, including viral genomic sequence data,"" US officials said in a statement quoted by news agencies.
""Without this data, it is becoming increasingly difficult for public health officials to ensure that they will be able to identify any potential new variants and take prompt measures to reduce the spread.""
Japan - one of the most popular destinations for Chinese travellers - has announced that all travellers from China must show a negative Covid test on arrival, or quarantine for seven days, because of the surge in cases there.
India has also said travellers from China (as well as some other countries) must show a negative Covid test when they arrive - though this was announced before Beijing's easing of restrictions.
g of travel rules in China - the last part of the country's zero-Covid policy - comes as the country battles a new wave of infections.
Resentment against the government's policy - which sparked rare public protests against President Xi Jinping in November - led to a relaxation of Covid restrictions across the country.
But an increase in Covid cases followed, with reports of hospitals overwhelmed and a shortage of drugs.
uncement on outbound travel on Tuesday came after Monday's news, which axed quarantine rules for travellers arriving in China. It also scrapped a cap on the daily number of flights.
On the same day, the National Health Commission announced that Covid would be formally downgraded to a Class B infectious disease on 8 January.
Before the relaxation of travel rules, people were strongly discouraged from travelling abroad. The sale of outbound group and package travel was banned, according to marketing solutions company Dragon Trail International.
Within half an hour of Monday's notice that China's borders would reopen, data from travel site Trip.com - cited in Chinese media - showed searches for popular destinations had increased ten-fold year-on-year. 
Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand and South Korea were the most popular destinations.
In addition, Chinese travel agency Qunar saw flight enquiries on its website increase seven-fold within the first 15 minutes after the announcement, the China Daily reports.
Before the pandemic, the number of outbound tourists from China stood at 155 million in 2019, according to Statista. This number dropped to 20 million in 2020.
r, some people in China will hope to visit family and loved ones during Chinese New Year, which begins on 22 January.
But inside China, there has been a mixed reaction.
""I'm happy about it but also speechless. If we're doing this [reopening] anyway - why did I have to suffer all the daily Covid tests and lockdowns this year?"" said Rachel Liu, who lives in Shanghai.
She said she had endured three months of lockdown in April - but nearly everyone in her family had become infected in recent weeks.
She said her parents, grandparents and partner - living across three different cities in Xi'an, Shanghai and Hangzhou - had all come down with fever last week.
Many have also expressed concern online about borders reopening as Covid cases peak.
""Why can't we wait until this wave passes to open up? The medical workers are already worn out, and old people won't survive two infections in one month,"" read one top-liked comment on Weibo.
People in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, which experience chilly temperatures in the winter, say they're running out of flu and cold medicine. 
It's feared that hundreds of deaths may be going unreported as crematoriums are overwhelmed. 
In the capital, Beijing, authorities say they are planning to distribute the Pfizer tablets, Paxlovid, in order to try to reduce the severity of infections. But health centres contacted by The Global Times on Monday said the drug had yet to be delivered.
On Monday, President Xi issued his first remarks on the changes, calling on officials to do what was ""feasible"" to save lives.
China's about-turn has put Mr Xi in a tough spot. He was the driving force behind zero-Covid, which many blamed for restricting people's lives excessively and crippling the economy. 
But having abandoned it, analysts say he now has to take responsibility for the huge wave of infections and hospital admissions. Many have questioned why the country was not better prepared.

health	Alzheimer's carer's drug hopes for husband, 56	"A woman whose husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at the age of 51 said she fears a new treatment might come too late for him.
Karen Bonser cares for her husband Mick, who was diagnosed in 2018.
Mrs Bonser, from Nottinghamshire, said the results of recent drug trials were ""wonderful to hear"" but added she feared he may not be eligible for the medication.
Alzheimer's Society has called for more early diagnosis of the disease.
recent development of a new medicine - lecanemab - was hailed as ending decades of failure to treat Alzheimer's.
rials have shown the drug can slow the progress of the disease.
However, researchers have warned it has a slight effect and worked only in the early stages of the disease, so many patients would miss out on the benefits.
However the breakthrough will, it is hoped, usher in a new era of drugs to treat the disease and make a difference for future generations.
Mrs Bonser said: ""We hold on to hope until told otherwise.
""The news brings much needed hope for people in the future but right now the medical system needs urgent attention to improve dementia diagnosis.
""There's no denying the results from the drug trials are wonderful to hear; it's a moment to celebrate in the dementia research world.
""As a carer for someone living with the condition now, hearing that it's likely not to be available for a few more years, it's time that could take us and others over a threshold for being eligible, and that's even if Mick would have been suitable.""
Alzheimer's Society has said there is a still a long way to go before lecanemab could be available on the NHS.
It has reinforced its calls for better dementia diagnosis.
Dr Richard Oakley, associate director of research at the charity, said: ""More than ever there's a need to prioritise early diagnosis, so people can access these drugs when they become available.
""The exciting results offer our best hope yet for not only delaying symptom progression for people with early stage Alzheimer's, but, significantly, slowing the loss of quality of life for them and their carers.""

politics	Six month delay to Scottish short-term lets licensing scheme	"which hosts of short-term lets in Scotland need to get a licence has been delayed by six months.
me, which could see fines of up to £2,500 imposed on people who rent out property without permission, was set up by the government in October.
It is aimed at reducing the impact of Airbnb-style lets on local communities and the availability of housing.
Hosts had until 31 March 2023 to apply for a licence, but this has now been pushed back until the start of October.
Housing Secretary Shona Robison said the ""one-off"" extension was agreed due to the impact of the cost-of-living crisis, but stressed that hosts should continue to apply.
Hospitality groups had raised concerns about the impact of the proposals on the tourism sector, particularly over the summer in Edinburgh when many people travel to the city for the annual festivals.
g scheme was set up in a bid to ensure consistent safety standards across short-term lets, as well as making sure hosts are fit and proper people and giving councils more control over the number of rentals.
Some areas, such as Edinburgh and the Highlands, see a large number of properties let out on a short-term basis, leading to concerns about a lack of housing for permanent residents and some complaints about anti-social behaviour and noise.
Applications to the scheme - which are handled by local authorities - were opened in October, and new hosts have to obtain a licence before they can operate a rental.
Existing hosts were given a deadline of 31 March 2023 to apply, but Ms Robison confirmed in a letter to Holyrood's housing committee that this has now been pushed back to 30 September.
She said: ""This is a one-off six month extension, which recognises the wider economic circumstances of the cost-of-living crisis that is placing pressure on existing short-term let hosts and businesses.
""This is not a pause and we encourage hosts to continue to apply throughout this period. It will not make any changes in our primary aim of ensuring all short-term lets across Scotland meet consistent safety standards and are provided by fit and proper people.""
Association of Scotland's Self-Caterers welcomed the move.
Chief executive Fiona Campbell said: ""The ASSC has been pressing hard for a pause to the implementation of the scheme due to the cost-of-living crisis so it's good to know our voices are being heard.
""Our ongoing concern however is that it is not long enough to give our members the breathing space they need to get their licence applications approved in the current climate.""
UK Short Term Accommodation Association (STAA) said the scheme could have a damaging effect on Scotland's tourism economy.
CEO Andy Fenner said:  ""We are pleased that the Scottish government has made its decision for a six month delay.  
""We have heard from the likes of the Edinburgh Festival that its future could be severely compromised because this licensing scheme will effectively limit the amount of accommodation on offer.""
Councils also have a separate power to set up short-term rental control zones, where hosts would need to get planning permission in order to let out a property."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63916032
politics	Scottish infected blood victims to receive payouts next week	"Lawyer says victims are 'generally very happy' that compensation payments are beginning
Scottish victims of the infected blood scandal of the 1970s and 80s will receive compensation by the end of October, the UK government has said.
It confirmed that thousands of patients who contracted Hepatitis C or HIV from contaminated blood will be given an interim payment of £100,000.
If the patient has died, their partner will receive the cash instead.
Scottish government said it ""welcomed the UK government commitment to funding interim payments"".
Public Health minister Maree Todd said: ""We recognise how important the issue of interim payments has been for Scottish Infected Blood Support Scheme (SIBSS) members, and those in the other UK support schemes, who have suffered for so long.""
""The interim compensation payments will build on the support already provided by SIBSS to many of those affected by this tragedy.""
Cabinet Office made the announcement following a report by blood inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff in July, saying the payments should be made ""without delay"".
He said the money should fund immediate bills and care needs, with final recommendations on compensation for a wider group of people expected when the inquiry concludes next year.
An independent study commissioned by the government in June said victims should be compensated for physical and social injury, the stigma of the disease, the impact on family and work life and the cost of care.
ments will not be subject to tax or national insurance deductions, or reduce any benefits being received.
It is estimated that about 3,000 people in Scotland were infected with Hepatitis C through NHS blood or blood products in the 1970s through to 1991. Some were also infected with HIV in the early 1980s.
People across the UK and around the world fell victim.
Patrick McGuire of Thompsons Solicitors in Glasgow, the firm representing a number of the victims, said people were ""generally very happy"" that compensation payments were beginning.
However, he added: ""If I was going to be hyper-critical I would say that it's taken a long time coming - but certainly this is a substantial sum of money that each victim of the contaminated blood scandal will receive and it's therefore to be welcomed. 
""Another very important thing to bear in mind is this is the first time the government has used the word compensation. 
""There have been support payments in the past but this is the first time that finally that word is being used and it's vital that is recognised as what is happening here - that the victims are being compensated for wrongs that were inflicted on them by the UK government.""
xpayer for the initial payments is expected to reach around £400m for the UK.
government is set to respond to any further inquiry recommendations when it concludes next year.
Ms Todd added: ""The Scottish government is grateful to Sir Brian for the interim report and welcomes the UK government's commitment to funding the interim payments.
""Existing SIBSS beneficiaries - both infected beneficiaries and widows, widowers or long-term partners of an infected beneficiary who has died - will receive an interim payment of £100,000 on 28 October.
""These are being administered by the Scottish ministers in conjunction with NHS National Services Scotland on behalf of the UK government.""
fected blood inquiry, which began in 2018, has taken evidence from more than 5,000 witnesses during hearings across all four UK nations.
Patients and their families described being kept in the dark about the risk of HIV infection among haemophiliac patients, having to keep diagnoses private through fear during the Aids crisis, and living with the physical effects of HIV.
Most of those involved had the blood-clotting disorder haemophilia and relied on regular injections of the US product Factor VIII to survive.
were unaware they were receiving contaminated product from people who were paid to donate, including prisoners and drug addicts.
Across the UK new cases of HIV and hepatitis continued to be diagnosed decades after the first contaminations, resulting in many early deaths."	/news/uk-scotland-63353508
politics	Social care tax rise should be re-examined, says Mark Drakeford	"An income tax rise to pay for free social care in Wales needs to be re-examined, the first minister has said.
Mark Drakeford said tax and public spending changes at a Westminster level ""strengthened"" the case for re-considering a specific social care tax.
Plaid Cymru's Adam Price said such a tax was an option for giving social care sustainable long-term funding. 
As part of a Labour-Plaid Cymru Senedd deal, both parties aim to provide a free National Care Service. 
-operation agreement aims to provide an implementation plan for a free social service by the end of 2023. 
udes commitments to provide free school meals for primary school children, control the numbers of second homes and holiday lets, and changes to the size of the Senedd. 
Marking a year since the start of the co-operation agreement with a news conference at the Welsh government's headquarters, Mr Drakeford and Mr Price said they would have to revisit their plans for free social care in light of changes at Westminster.
UK government has recently reversed its original plan to use an increase in national insurance - a UK-wide tax on earners - in order to provide long-term funding for social care.
In November, the chancellor also presented an Autumn Statement which outlined slower growth in public spending from 2025 onwards.
first minister said the ""changed context at the UK level does mean that we're looking again"" at the plans for free social care.
Mr Drakeford also said he believes the case ""has strengthened for us going back"" to look at options for a social care levy ""to see whether it offers us an alternative way of resolving some of these dilemmas in Wales"".
In 2018, economist Prof Gerald Holtham proposed an income tax increase of between 1% and 3% to fund elderly social care in Wales.
Speaking at the news conference, Plaid Cymru's leader Mr Price said: ""We've basically had Westminster for more than a decade continually moving in circles, u-turn after u-turn, no progress.
""What I think we have to conclude is if we wait for Westminster to come up with a sustainable solution to their social care challenges...then we will be waiting possibly forever.""
Mr Price added: ""I do think we need to revisit some of the ideas which were proposed earlier stages by Professor Holtham to see if that...is the way forward on a sustainable basis for the kind of National Care Service that we want to create.""
Ahead of the news conference, Welsh Conservative Senedd Leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""One year on since the cooperation agreement, Labour and Plaid have brought in one disastrous proposal after another, from default 20mph speed limits to tourism taxes to creating more politicians in Cardiff Bay, that are not only far removed from the wishes of the Welsh people, but their needs too.
""The priorities of voters have been completely ignored, with NHS waiting lists sky-rocketing beyond anything seen elsewhere in Britain, the blocking of a Wales-specific Covid inquiry, and school standards, public transport services, and pay packets all diminishing.

He faces a number of challenges including a cost-of-living crisis, a war in Europe as well as pressure to get Stormont working again.
In May, Sinn Féin was returned as the assembly's largest party, however, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) blocked the forming of an executive.
DUP withdrew in protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
As it stands, unless an executive is formed by 00:01 BST on Friday 28 October, people in Northern Ireland could, once again, be heading to the polls.
Mr Sunak has received a mixed reaction from the Stormont party leaders and senior politicians in the Republic of Ireland.
Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O'Neill has said Rishi Sunak must ""prioritise the restoration of the executive"" and ""respect democracy"".
""In May, people voted for change. To make politics work,"" she said, referencing her party's success in the assembly election when it was returned with the most number of seats.
""I've been ready to form an executive with others to help workers and families under real pressure with the cost of living crisis.""
Sir Jeffrey Donaldson congratulated Mr Sunak on his victory in the Conservative leadership contest and said the challenge for the new PM remains to deal with the Northern Ireland Protocol.
DUP leader said Mr Sunak must ""restore Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom"". 
""There may be a focus on the unity of the Conservative Party, but the unity of our United Kingdom must be protected,"" Sir Jeffrey said.  
""If the prime minister wants to see a fully-functioning Stormont, then he must deal with it once and for all. 
""Delivering that solution would be a very powerful signal that that he is focused on building a better future for everyone.""
Alliance leader Naomi Long said Mr Sunak ""must prioritise reform of the institutions to end ransom politics"" and called on him to ""take the opportunity to have a fresh approach to Northern Ireland"".
""The lack of an executive is compounding the cost-of-living crisis and the unprecedented pressures on our public services and finances,"" Ms Long said. 
""Rishi Sunak needs to recognise, even if a solution to the protocol can be agreed with the EU, there remains an inherent instability at the heart of our institutions.""
Ms Long described the protocol as ""only the latest in a long line of grievances to have collapsed Stormont"" and called for reform of the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland.
Alliance leader said the prospect of fresh Stormont elections, with or without a deal on the Northern Ireland Protocol, ""solves nothing"".
Doug Beattie said that one of the new prime minister's priorities ""must be resolving the political impasse"" and ""dealing with the issues caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol"". 
Ulster Unionist leader said: ""Northern Ireland cannot continue to be used as political football between the United Kingdom and the EU. 
""The Protocol must be replaced with a deal that works for everyone.""
Mr Beattie said that ""everyone knows what needs to be done and now is the time to be getting on with it"".
Colum Eastwood branded the process in which Rishi Sunak succeeds Liz Truss as prime minister as a ""farce"".
Mr Eastwood said Mr Sunak had no mandate to serve as prime minister and urged him to call a general election. 
""It is completely illegitimate and an affront to democracy for the Tories to elevate Rishi Sunak to the position of prime minister with no mandate whatsoever,"" the SDLP leader said. 
""Mr Sunak's predecessors have completely destroyed the public's confidence in politics and public service and wrecked the economy.
""He should not be allowed another two years to desperately attempt to clean up their mess.""
Jim Allister said the new prime minister's actions on the Northern Ireland Protocol will determine ""how we will judge him"".
UV leader said the protocol is a ""core constitutional issue which he must deal with"" and said this ""sovereignty issue"" will determine the future of Stormont.
(Irish PM) congratulated Mr Sunak on becoming Tory leader, saying: ""I look forward to working with you, as British PM, on the important issues we face on these islands, and globally.""
ánaiste [Irish deputy prime minister] Leo Varadkar said he looked forward to working with Mr Sunak.
In a tweet, Mr Vardakar said: ""These are challenging times of war, inflation, global uncertainty. I look forward to the UK working with Ireland and the EU as friends and allies in the years ahead.""
European Council President Charles Michel offered his congratulations to Rishi Sunak. 
With UK-EU talks ongoing over the Northern Ireland Protocol, Mr Michel said in a tweet: ""Working together is the only way to face common challenges... and bringing stability is key to overcoming them.""
Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said the Irish government would work ""in partnership"" with Rishi Sunak's administration in response to the collapse of power sharing in Northern Ireland, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reports.
Speaking in Galway on Monday, Mr Coveney hoped both governments would work with the DUP to see if an executive could be formed to avoid an ""unnecessary election""."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63376833
politics	Senior SNP MP criticises new Westminster leader	"SNP's longest-serving MP has quit the party's frontbench team in the Commons after criticising its new Westminster leader.
Pete Wishart said he was ""bemused"" as to why Stephen Flynn had sought to replace Ian Blackford in the role.
And he claimed there had been no opportunity to discuss Mr Flynn's plans for the group ahead of Tuesday's vote. 
Another prominent SNP MP, Stewart McDonald, has also said he will be stepping down as defence spokesman.
In his resignation letter, he said the SNP was at its best ""when we collaborate as a united party"" and urged the new leadership to ""keep this at the forefront of their mind and work in that spirit across the party"".
Mr Flynn defeated Alison Thewliss - who is seen as being closer to Nicola Sturgeon - in the ballot of SNP MPs.
re had been rumours for some time that he was ""on manoeuvres"" to replace Mr Blackford, who had served as group leader for five years and was also a close ally of Ms Sturgeon.
Mr Blackford announced last week that he was standing down from the role, with the vote to replace him being held just days later.  
Mr Flynn has already replaced Owen Thompson as chief whip with Martin Docherty-Hughes being appointed to the role, and there are more changes expected to be announced in the coming days. 
Allies of the new leader have suggested he wants to have a smaller front-bench team, allowing other MPs to focus on constituency work and campaigning for independence.
re have also been reports that Mr Flynn intends to take a more robust approach to the group's relationship with Ms Sturgeon and the SNP government at Holyrood. 
Mr Wishart, who has been an MP since 2001, had been the party's agriculture spokesman in the Commons. 
In his resignation letter to the new leader, he wrote: ""I remain bemused as to the reasons why you felt it was necessary to seek a change in our leadership"".
Highlighting an opinion poll published on Wednesday that suggested support for independence was at 56% and the SNP at 51% for a general election - higher than other recent polls - he added: ""Usually change of this significance accompanies failure.
""We are looking only at sustained and growing success as a party and a movement and party.
""I am sure that this will become apparent to me during the course of your leadership. I also look forward to seeing first-hand what you hope to do differently in the day-to-day management of the group.""
He also appeared to take aim at a perceived lack of communication from Mr Flynn - who was little known outside political circles before winning the leadership vote - about what he planned to do now he had taken over from Mr Blackford.
Mr Wishart said: ""We never had an opportunity to discuss your plans for the group, neither when you were canvassing opinion for a leadership challenge nor at any point during the very short campaign for the leadership itself.""
He said he noted that Mr Flynn wished to ""reset"" the relationship between the Westminster group and its colleagues in the Scottish government and Scottish Parliament. 
Mr Wishart added: ""The Westminster group is unique in the respect that we are a party of power in a parliament in which that power can never be exercised. 
""Many of us carry the scars following the many attempts to manage that unfortunate tension over the course of the years.""
Despite the criticisms, Mr Wishart said Mr Flynn would have his full support, adding: ""We are always better when we work together, fully support our government and stand side by side with all colleagues regardless of which parliament they serve.""
Mr Flynn thanked Mr Wishart for his ""exemplary service"" to the SNP over many years, adding: ""As ever, my door remains open and I look forward to working with you as we support colleagues in Holyrood, hold the Tories to account, and work to deliver independence.''
Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said the SNP were ""fighting like ferrets in a sack"" and described Mr Wishart's letter as ""the latest evidence of the deep splits running through the SNP"".
He added: ""Policy and personal disagreements are emerging all the time as the party's reputation for iron discipline under Nicola Sturgeon disintegrates"".
It comes the day after another senior SNP MP - Stewart Hosie - told BBC Scotland that reports of division within the party's Westminster group were ""complete fiction"".
Mr Hosie, who backed Mr Flynn for the leadership, added that ""not one word of that is true"" and he had ""no idea where these stories have come from"".
re had been reports for several months that many SNP MPs were increasingly unhappy with Mr Blackford's leadership, particularly after he urged them to give their full support to former chief whip Patrick Grady.
Mr Grady was suspended from the party and the Commons earlier this year for sexual misconduct.
Mr Flynn denied just two weeks ago that he was plotting to oust Mr Blackford alongside colleagues from the so-called Tuesday Club - a group of male SNP MPs who are said to hold regular five-a-side football, beer and curry nights. 
Pete Wishart's letter has rather let the air out of the SNP's ""nothing to see here"" position on its Westminster leadership change.
first minister had insisted the move to replace Ian Blackford was not a coup. MP Stewart Hosie said talk of splits was ""complete fiction"".
But Mr Wishart has now confirmed that Mr Flynn had been canvassing colleagues for some time, while directly accusing him of ""seeking a change in our leadership"". 
f those wonderful political things where a party sticks doggedly to a position despite the fact nobody actually believes it.
It is an understandable tactic in a way, and one employed by every party at one time or another. It's obviously in the SNP's interests to close ranks and insist everything is fine, as doing anything else would only provide ammunition for their opponents.
Mr Wishart has been at Westminster longer than any of his colleagues - he knows exactly what his intervention means, as a jarring outbreak of reality amid the spin."	/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-63902503
politics	Manston migrant centre like a zoo, says asylum seeker	"Conditions at an overcrowded migrant centre in Kent were akin to living in a prison or a zoo, a recent resident has told the BBC. 
Ahmed - not his real name - said people at the Manston processing centre were treated like ""animals"" with 130 people forced to share a single large tent. 
More than 4,000 migrants have reportedly been held at the camp - meant to host 1,600 - in recent days. 
Home Office says it is providing for ""all the basic needs"" of migrants.
Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick previously insisted the number of people at Manston is coming down. 
Ahmed - who left the centre on Monday after 24 days there - described being forced to sleep on the floor, and being prevented from going to the toilet, taking a shower or going outside for exercise.
He told the BBC that he fled his home country of Iran in search of freedom and to avoid persecution, saying that he had been living in fear for his life. 
But after arriving in the UK and at the centre, Ahmed said people were prevented from calling their families to let them know they had made the crossing to the UK safely. 
""For the 24 days I'm in there, I can't call to my family to say to them I'm dead, I'm living - they don't know anything about me,"" he said.
""All people in there, they have a family. They should know what is happening to us."" 
Manston, a former military base in Kent, opened as a processing centre in February for the growing number of migrants reaching the UK in small boats. Migrants are meant to be held there for short periods of time while undergoing security and identity checks.
re then supposed to be moved into the Home Office's asylum accommodation system, which often means a hotel due to a shortage of available accommodation. 
But Manston became even more crowded at the weekend when 700 migrants were sent there from another centre in Dover, which was firebombed.
Several hundred asylum seekers were relocated from the Manston centre on Tuesday, according to one of the MPs in Kent, Conservative Sir Roger Gale.
More will leave throughout the week he said, tweeting: ""This must never be allowed to happen again.""
Mr Jenrick tweeted on Tuesday that the numbers of migrants held at the centre had ""fallen substantially"". 
""Unless we receive an unexpectedly high number of migrants in small boats in the coming days, numbers will fall significantly this week,"" he said. ""It's imperative that the site returns a sustainable operating model and we are doing everything we can to ensure that happens swiftly.""
But the British Red Cross said ""the serious problems at Manston are indicative of the wider issues facing the asylum system"".
A huge number of migrants have arrived in the UK this year. So far this year, there have been almost 40,000 arrivals in Kent - with nearly 1,000 crossing the Channel on Saturday alone. 
Separately, the BBC received photos of unaccompanied children being forced to sleep on the floor at another unnamed Home Office facility in Kent. The pictures show a sparsely decorated room, with a few books and a box of Scrabble as entertainment to help pass the time in the facility.
Writing in different languages is seen scrawled on the walls above a row of plastic chairs, fixed to the floor. The facility is used to process unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.
A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""Manston remains resourced and equipped to process migrants securely and we will provide alternative accommodation as soon as possible. 
""The number of people arriving in the UK via small boats has reached record levels, which has put our asylum system under incredible pressure and costs the British taxpayer millions of pounds a day.
""We provide for all the basic needs of people who will have arrived tired, cold, in wet clothing and who may not have eaten during their journey. The Home Office provides 24/7 health facilities at Manston as well as having robust contingency plans to deal with health issues such as communicable diseases.""
government has come under huge pressure to tackle the rise in small boat crossings and to speed up the processing of migrants already in the UK. 
Home Secretary Suella Braverman has been accused by opposition parties of ignoring legal advice that said she had to source additional hotel accommodation to prevent overcrowding at the centre. 
Ms Braverman rejected the accusations.
me secretary was also accused of using inflammatory language, after saying southern England was facing an ""invasion"" of migrants during a heated House of Commons session.
Refugee Council said her language was ""appalling, wrong and dangerous"". Her immigration minister Mr Jenrick later said politicians must be careful with their language around migration issues. 
And the prime minister's official spokesman said Rishi Sunak told his cabinet at a meeting on Tuesday that the UK would ""always be a compassionate, welcoming country"".
Meanwhile, counter-terror police have taken over the investigation into an attack the firebombing of an immigration processing centre in Dover in Kent on Sunday. 
Detectives have said Andrew Leak, 66, from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, likely carried out the attack in ""some form of hate-filled grievance"" before killing himself.

politics	Loyalists: Police say rising tensions remain under close watch	"Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) does not believe loyalist paramilitary groups, based on a current assessment, will break their 1994 ceasefires.
But it does acknowledge tension within loyalist communities has risen lately.
Much of this is down to talk, before being corrected, of joint London-Dublin rule being imposed.
""As a collective, they are not moving to a more 'military' footing,"" a senior security source said.
ment involved the input of the security service, MI5.
w development as far as evaluating whether loyalist groups, principally the UVF and the UDA, pose any national security threat.
But the fact this is being briefed out is a warning they are being watched very closely.
MI5 operations in Northern Ireland have historically been much more focused on dissident republican groups.
guage and the sentiment of a recent letter from the Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) to Unionist leaders, which spoke of ""dire consequences"", was not new.
Irish ministers were first told they were not welcome in Northern Ireland in June 2021 and months prior to that, the UK Government was informed the basis of the ceasefires had been undermined by the Irish Sea border.
Among LCC members are representatives of the UVF, UDA and Red Hand Commando - proscribed organisations, significant elements of which remain deeply involved in criminality, such as drug dealing and extortion, and who continue to recruit.
LCC was formed in 2015 to address social issues in loyalist communities and help reduce paramilitary activity.
During the course of the last two years, the LCC, a legal organisation, has met Northern Ireland Office officials, Lord Frost, when he was Brexit minister, and the DUP.
So what was behind the latest letter?
""A lot of it was sabre-rattling,"" said one person aware of loyalist thinking.
uggested reports of an aborted attack in the Republic of Ireland the week before last were ""a bit of an exaggeration"".
Alluding to this, PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne told Thursday's Policing Board meeting that while the PSNI could not have full knowledge of everything, there was a gap between what was stated and what loyalists had the ""capability and capacity"" to do.
For context, there has not been any significant street disorder in Northern Ireland since April 2021 and this was followed by two bus hijackings that November, both blamed on the UVF.
f note was the elaborate bomb hoax, again said to involve the UVF, targeting a visit to north Belfast by the Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney in March.
re is a belief in security circles that dozens of peaceful anti-Protocol demonstrations which took place up until the summer provided a kind of release valve for simmering anger and frustration.
A source said: ""They are happy the DUP has given no ground on the protocol or a return to Stormont. 
""At the minute it is watch and react.""
re are also suggestions that UVF and UDA leadership figures from the troubles era have tried to keep a brake on things, as was referenced in the last year's report by the International Reporting Commission.
But this could become harder to manage.
Beneath the headline of ceasefires holding, there is a current concern, one which may develop, or ease, depending on how the politics of the protocol ultimately plays out.
It is based on loyalism not being a cohesive body.
PSNI remains alive to the possibility that individuals could act and of a possible breakaway element which older leadership figures could not push back against.
""Tension has increased in the last couple of weeks. There's definitely been a turning up of the dial,"" a senior officer said.
""Our antenna is up and we are pro-actively monitoring things.""
At the Policing Board meeting, Simon Byrne stressed that he was not ""a soothsayer"" and the security picture he outlined is rooted firmly in the present.
He called for rhetoric to be calmed down - and provided a security assessment which appeared to match."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63514656
politics	What is a non-dom?	"ue of non-dom status is one of the big dividing lines between the government and the opposition.
It was in the news earlier in the year, when it was revealed that now Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's wife, Akshata Murty, has non-dom status, which allows people living in the UK to avoid paying UK tax on money they made outside the UK.
She later said that she would start paying UK tax on her earnings from outside the UK.
""Non-dom"" is short for ""non-domiciled individual"". 
It's a term used for a UK resident whose permanent home, or domicile, is outside the UK.
""Non-dom"" is a description of tax status, and has nothing to do with one's chosen nationality, citizenship or resident status (although it can be affected by these factors).
A non-dom only pays UK tax on money earned in the UK but does not have to pay any tax to the UK on money made elsewhere in the world (unless they pay that money into a UK bank account).
For wealthy individuals, this presents the opportunity for significant - and entirely legal - savings, if they choose a lower-tax country for their domicile.
You can become a non-dom in two main ways: 
Akshata Murty's status as a non-dom rests on the fact that her father is Indian, and she was born and grew up in India.
If you are a non-dom and you choose not to pay tax in the UK on your overseas earnings, you must pay a substantial annual charge:
In 2017, the non-dom rules were changed. You can no longer claim this status if you have been a UK resident for 15 out of the previous 20 years, or if all the following conditions apply:
A non-dom has to provide evidence to UK tax authorities about their background, lifestyle and future intentions.
However, if you earn less than £2,000 a year from foreign earnings, and you do not bring that money into the UK, you do not have to do anything.
Asked on BBC Radio 4 why he had not tightened rules for non-doms, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: ""I would rather wealthy foreigners spent their money in Britain because that supports jobs in our shops, in our restaurants, in our hotels."" 
Labour has said it would end non-dom status. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told BBC News that doing so, ""could bring in £3bn or so"".
figure comes from research by the London School of Economics, which also suggested that only 0.3% of the people affected would decide to leave the country as a result.
Responding to a question about what the Treasury had told him about non-dom status, Jeremy Hunt said: ""they were very unsure about the figures that were being bandied around as far as the savings are concerned and, like me, they wanted to be very sure that we weren't doing things that damaged the UK's attractiveness"".
Institute for Fiscal Studies said in a 2015 report on abolishing it: ""whether it would raise much, if any, revenue is uncertain"", although it said that did not necessarily mean it was a bad idea. 
Yes, for more than 200 years.
It was originally introduced in 1799 and allowed people with foreign property to shelter it from wartime taxes.
It has became a regular point of debate whenever the legal tax affairs of the wealthy hit the headlines.
In 2010 it was revealed that several members of the House of Lords had non-dom status, including the Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, and on the Labour benches, Lord Paul.
According to the latest figures from HM Revenue and Customs, there were 68,300 people claiming non-dom status in the UK in the tax year ending 2021. 
was down from 75,700 the year before and follows a downward trend since rule changes in 2017.

politics	Rishi Sunak says he is unaware of any formal complaints against Dominic Raab	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said he is ""not aware"" of formal complaints against Dominic Raab, who has been accused of demeaning colleagues. 
Several newspapers have reported allegations of bullying by Mr Raab, who was reappointed justice secretary and deputy prime minister by Mr Sunak.
Mr Sunak said  he did not ""recognise that characterisation"" of Mr Raab.
Mr Raab's spokesman said he ""holds himself to the highest standards of professionalism"".
Mr Sunak has come under pressure over his judgement after Sir Gavin Williamson resigned last week over allegations of bullying and threatening behaviour. Mr Sunak also faced criticism for reinstating Suella Braverman as home secretary just six days after she was forced to step down for breaching the ministerial code.
On Friday, the Guardian said it had spoken to multiple sources who alleged Mr Raab's behaviour with civil servants had been ""demeaning"" and ""very rude and aggressive"" during his first stint at the MoJ between September 2021 and September 2022.
Mr Raab was sacked as justice secretary and deputy prime minister by former PM Liz Truss, but was reappointed to those roles by Rishi Sunak following his election as leader by Tory MPs.
Mirror reported Mr Raab had acquired the nickname ""The Incinerator"" because he ""burns through"" staff. 
Sun, meanwhile, suggested Mr Raab had once hurled tomatoes from a salad across a room in a fit of anger, a claim a spokesman for the Cabinet minister said was ""nonsense"".
rime minister told reporters travelling with him to Indonesia for the G20 summit: ""I don't recognise that characterisation of Dominic and I'm not aware of any formal complaints about him.
""Of course, there are established procedures for civil servants if they want to bring to light any issues.""
Downing Street said that the prime minister believed that  people in public life should treat others with ""consideration and respect"".
A No 10 spokesperson said that, while they were not aware of any formal complaint concerning Mr Raab, there were procedures available to civil servants if they had concerns.
""There are established procedures by which civil servants can raise complaints. These processes allow allegations to be looked at and considered with due process and a fair hearing,"" the spokesperson said.
And a spokesperson for Mr Raab said: ""The DPM has worked in government for over seven years as a minister or secretary of state across four departments and enjoyed strong working relationships with officials across Whitehall.  
""He consistently holds himself to the highest standards of professionalism and has never received nor been made aware of any formal complaint against him.""
Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""This is yet another example of Rishi Sunak's poor judgement and weak leadership.
""As families struggle during a cost-of-living crisis made in Downing Street, yet another Tory government has descended into chaos.""
Liberal Democrats have written to the Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, calling on the Cabinet Office to publish a list of ministers who have credible allegations of bullying made against them.

""If the Cabinet Office knew about these allegations then they must make that public now.""
A spokesperson for Mr Raab said he had ""worked in government for over seven years as a Minister or Secretary of State across four departments and enjoyed strong working relationships with officials across Whitehall.

politics	Rishi Sunak refusing to budge on pay as strike action escalates	"WATCH: Rishi Sunak is asked to give a personal message to NHS workers and others taking strike action
Rishi Sunak has insisted he will not back down against striking workers, as nurses walked out in England, Northern Ireland and Wales for a second day. 
Nurses' union boss Pat Cullen has urged the prime minister to resolve the crisis before Christmas.
But there is no sign of a breakthrough between the sides.
Speaking to MPs, Mr Sunak argued the best way to help workers would be to reduce inflation as quickly as possible. 
UK is facing its biggest week of industrial strikes in recent history in the run up to Christmas, with ambulance workers, customs and immigration staff, bus drivers and postal workers all staging walk outs. 
rmed forces have been drafted in to cover some jobs - but concern is growing about Wednesday's ambulance drivers strike in England and Wales, with a health minister warning people to avoid ""risky activity"".
Head of the NHS confederation, and a former Labour adviser, Matthew Taylor has warned that hospital leaders cannot guarantee patient safety during the strikes.
In a letter to Mr Sunak, he said: ""It is clear that we have entered dangerous territory and we hope this warning from NHS leaders should serve to focus minds in government and in the unions that a swift resolution to this damaging dispute is needed.""
WATCH: Ambulance staff are tired of waiting outside hospitals with patients, says GMB
Mr Sunak is facing calls to reopen talks on nurses' pay and deal with the growing wave of strikes across the public services.
Conservative backbencher Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said that both sides ""need to get round the table and see what can be done.""
But addressing the Liaison Committee of senior MPs Mr Sunak said: ""I've acknowledged it is difficult for everybody, because inflation is where it is. 
""The best way to help them and help everyone else in the country is for us to get a grip and reduce inflation as quickly as possible.""
He said sticking to the wage levels set by the pay review boards earlier this year was an important part of tackling high inflation. 
Despite the prime minister's insistence that he is holding firm, some Conservative MPs have said he will need to budge on nurses' pay.
So far only a handful have said so publicly, but others have expressed concern in private conversations with the BBC. 
One former minister said the government would have to shift eventually and come up with more money,
Another suggested ministers should consider offering a slightly increased offer, albeit still well below the 19% being called for, or a one-off payment to help with rising prices.
A third senior Conservative added: ""I'd be surprised if the pay offer as is on the table wins - unless they are prepared to carry this on for six months.""
However, even behind the scenes, government officials do not want to get into details about possible compromises.
And some Tory MPs are urging the PM to maintain his stance, fearing any concessions would encourage future strikes. 
""Give in to one group then the whole lot will cascade around him,"" said one former minister.
Earlier, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing said she was ""truly sorry"" for every patient who would have their care disrupted.
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Ms Cullen said she would negotiate with the government, saying ""we won't dig in if they don't dig in.""
""But we have no opportunity to do that because we can't get to a table to talk to government.""
She has warned that if the government isn't ""prepared to do the right thing"" her union would have ""no choice"" but to continue striking in January.
Royal College of Nursing has called for a 19% pay rise (5% above the RPI inflation rate) but the government has said this is unaffordable.
Ambulance staff - who are set to walk out on Wednesday - also want above-inflation pay rises, but have not set a specific figure.  
Health Secretary Steve Barclay met unions ahead of the strike on Tuesday afternoon, however Unite representative Onay Kasab described the meeting as ""entirely pointless"" because Mr Barclay had refused to discuss pay.
Following the meeting, Mr Barclay said the pay demands were ""unaffordable"" but added that he was open to ""engaging with unions on how to make the NHS a better place to work""."	/news/uk-politics-64037292

Last week, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was confident that ""with goodwill and pragmatism"" a breakthrough can happen in negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
He was speaking after talks with Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin following a meeting of the British-Irish Council.
Mr Martin said said there was a ""window of opportunity"" but declined to be drawn on how long negotiations could last.

However, it also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses.
Some unionists say it is also undermining Northern Ireland's place in the UK.
UK plans to override most of the agreement if the EU does not agree to changes.
Mr Cleverly said if an auditor asked him to point to a spreadsheet and show where progress was being made he would struggle, but added ""I think we are heading in the right direction"".
""The ingredients are there but we shouldn't rush to the conclusion, therefore, everything is about to come good because there is still serious work to do"".
Asked where the protocol stood on the UK Government's list of priorities, the Foreign Secretary said ""its up there, its on the podium"".
He said it was not a peripheral trade issue but was about showing Northern Ireland is as much a part of the union as his own constituency of Braintree in Essex."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63637377
politics	Rishi Sunak: Golden era of UK-China relations is over	"Rishi Sunak has said the so-called ""golden era"" of relations with China is over, as he vowed to ""evolve"" the UK's stance towards the country.
In his first foreign policy speech, Mr Sunak said the closer economic ties of the previous decade had been ""naïve"".
rime minister said the UK had to replace wishful thinking with ""robust pragmatism"" towards competitors.
But he warned against ""Cold War rhetoric"", adding that China's global significance could not be ignored.
Mr Sunak has faced pressure from Tory backbenchers to toughen the UK's stance on China since he took over as prime minister last month. 
His speech, at the Lord Mayor's Banquet in London, comes after protests in China over the weekend against the country's strict Covid lockdown laws.
Police have made several arrests, and a BBC journalist was detained while covering a protest in Shanghai on Sunday. He was beaten and kicked by the police during his arrest and held for several hours before being released.
Mr Sunak told the audience of business leaders and foreign policy experts that, in the face of the protests, China had ""chosen to crack down further, including by assaulting a BBC journalist"".
""We recognise China poses a systemic challenge to our values and interests, a challenge that grows more acute as it moves towards even greater authoritarianism,"" he said.

He added that the ""golden era"" of UK-China relations was ""over"", along with the ""naïve idea"" that more trade with the West would lead to Chinese political reform.
rase ""golden era"" is associated with closer economic ties under former Prime Minister David Cameron - but relations between London and Beijing have since deteriorated.
However, Mr Sunak stressed that ""we cannot simply ignore China's significance in world affairs - to global economic stability or issues like climate change"".
He added that the UK would work with allies including the US, Canada, Australia, and Japan to ""manage this sharpening competition, including with diplomacy and engagement"".
""It means standing up to our competitors, not with grand rhetoric but with robust pragmatism,"" he added. 
Mr Sunak and Chinese President Xi Jinping were set to meet for the first time at the G20 summit in Indonesia earlier this month, but the encounter was cancelled following a missile blast in Poland.
Mr Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss was reportedly planning to re-categorise China as a ""threat"" to the UK as part of a review of its foreign policy.
In his speech, Mr Sunak echoed the phrase used in the review - that China is a ""systemic challenge"". He said there would be more details of the review in the new year. 
ruth is, right now, we don't know in practical terms what this new approach will actually amount to.
Mr Sunak is promising more detail in what is known as the Integrated Review - which will set out the UK's national security and foreign policy - in the new year.
But we know already how China is now described: a ""systemic challenge"".
government hopes that people will understand that international relations, like any human relations, are complex and nuanced; that a binary approach, as they see it, would not be in the UK's interests.
But for the prime minister's critics, failing to describe Beijing as a ""threat"" is a big mistake.
But the ""robust pragmatism"" line in the speech was criticised by former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith - one of a number of backbenchers pushing for a tougher line.
During an urgent question in the Commons on the safety of British journalists in China, he asked the Foreign Office minister to explain ""how 'robustly pragmatic' will worry the Chinese any one bit?""
Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy called the speech ""thin as gruel"", accusing the government of ""flip-flopping its rhetoric on China"".
Nigel Inkster, senior China advisor at foreign affairs think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he did not think the China-UK golden age ""was ever real and substantial"". 
He said: ""It attempted to focus on economic relations with China while putting geopolitics to one side, and experience shows you simply can't do that.""
Renewed debate about the UK's relationship with China comes as members of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee have travelled to Taiwan - which Beijing claims as it territory - to meet its president. 
mmittee is holding an inquiry into UK foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific region and how it can maximise its influence there. 
Elsewhere in his speech, Mr Sunak promised to continue support for Ukraine, adding: ""We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.""
He promised to ""maintain or increase"" British military aid to the country next year, and provide new air support to protect civilians and critical infrastructure.
Mr Sunak visited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this month, in his first visit to Kyiv since entering Downing Street.
During the visit, he announced the UK would supply Ukraine with additional anti-aircraft guns and radars, and increase the training offer to Ukraine's armed forces. 
President Zelensky's wife, Olena Zelenska, made her own visit to London on Monday where she spoke about sexual violence allegedly being perpetrated by Russian troops in Ukraine."	/news/uk-politics-63787877
politics	Labour Senedd member reprimanded for 'vulgar' tweet	"A Labour MS breached the Senedd's code of conduct by tweeting a ""vulgar and grossly offensive personal attack"", the standards commissioner has concluded.
It follows an investigation by Douglas Bain into a tweet by Caerphilly Senedd member Hefin David in March.
In his report, Mr Bain noted the MS had apologised and deleted the post early the next day.
Senedd members are expected to vote to formally reprimand Mr David in the Welsh Parliament next week.
He admitted to the commissioner that the tweet was inappropriate.
mmittee decided not to include the contents of the tweet in its report ""as we consider it may cause further distress to the subject and their family to do so, particularly as they were not the complainant"".
In his report to the standards committee, Mr Bain says Senedd members ""are rightly required to show leadership and to be exemplars of good behaviour"". 
He said ""abusive use of social media reflects badly on him but also tends to bring the Senedd into disrepute"" and concluded that Mr David's conduct ""fell very far below the required standards"".
Mr Bain says the MS has told him he has taken steps to prevent ""any further misuse of social media"" and that he had urged him to ""take care in his use of that medium"".
Mr David declined to comment.
He was previously found in breach of the code of conduct for calling someone a ""coc oen"" (Welsh for ""lamb's cock"") on Twitter in 2019, although he was not formally punished."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63675965
politics	Scottish independence: Supreme Court to rule on referendum case	"Supreme Court judges are to rule on whether the Scottish government has the power to hold another independence referendum.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants a referendum to be held on 19 October next year.
But the UK government has so far refused to give formal consent for the vote to go ahead. 
urt was asked to clarify whether the Scottish Parliament can legislate for a referendum without that consent. 
Its decision is due to be delivered at 09:45 on Wednesday, with the result potentially having huge implications for the future of the UK.
Pro-independence rallies will be held in several Scottish towns and cities after the ruling is announced, and Ms Sturgeon is also expected to give her response to the decision. 
first minister has previously said she wants to reach an agreement with the UK government similar to the one that was in place ahead of the referendum in 2014, when Scottish voters backed staying in the UK by 55% to 45%,
She has said this would ensure the result is seen as being legitimate and is recognised by the international community, and has accused Westminster of having no respect for democracy by opposing a referendum. 
But a series of prime ministers - including Rishi Sunak - have argued that the country's focus should be on dealing with issues such as the cost of living crisis and the war in Ukraine rather than independence, and that the result of the 2014 referendum should be respected.
re have also been suggestions that the pro-UK side could boycott a referendum even if the court rules in favour of the Scottish government. 
ruling could have a huge bearing on the debate about Scottish independence and on whether there is to be a referendum next October.
But it is also not going to put the issue to bed on its own. Regardless of the outcome, an almighty political row is going to follow the case.
A Scottish government win would pave the way for a referendum which in their own words would be ""advisory"" and ""consultative"". 
re would still need to be negotiations with Westminster to actually deliver independence, and Nicola Sturgeon would still want both sides to sign up to a full-throated campaign to make sure the result is internationally recognised.
If the UK government wins, Ms Sturgeon is not going to simply give up on independence. She has been clear that she would paint such an outcome as another roadblock in the path of Scottish democracy, and would hope that the perceived unfairness of being denied a say would prompt a wave of public support.
re would also be significant questions for UK ministers about how exactly the constitutional question is ever going to be resolved, given it continues to dominate Scottish politics.
Judges can rule on what the law tells us, but in the end only politicians can settle this issue once and for all.
was referred to the Supreme Court by Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC, the Scottish government's top law officer.
Ms Bain said she did not have the ""necessary degree of confidence"" that Holyrood would have the power to pass legislation for a referendum without UK government consent. 
She said the issue was of ""exceptional public importance"" and asked the UK's top court to provide a definitive ruling. 
urt heard two days of legal arguments from both the UK and Scottish governments last month, with its ruling being delivered just six weeks later - earlier than many experts had expected.
Issues relating to the constitution, including the union between Scotland and England, are reserved to the UK Parliament in London under the rules that created the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999. 
UK government told the court it was therefore clear that ""legislating for a referendum on independence would be outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament"". 
It lawyers also urged the court to refuse to rule on the case, arguing that the question is purely hypothetical at this stage because Holyrood had not yet passed a referendum bill.
But Ms Bain said any referendum would be ""advisory"" and would have no legal effect on the union, with people simply being asked to give their opinion on whether or not Scotland should become an independent country. 
Recent opinion polls have suggested that Scotland is essentially split down the middle on the independence question, but with a very narrow majority in favour of staying in the UK.
Ms Sturgeon has said she will use the next general election as a ""de facto referendum"" if the court ruling goes against her, with the SNP fighting the election on the single issue of independence."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63716412
politics	Cost of living: Woman, 78, lives in bedroom to keep warm	"A 78-year-old woman has described how she spends most of her time living in her bedroom because she cannot afford to heat the rest of her home.
Audrey Roberts said she has been like this for years and is used to it, but this is the coldest she has known. 
ghlight the issue Friends of the Earth has shared thermal images to show how people are affected by the cold.
It is campaigning to get UK governments to improve insulation in homes, and provide more help with heating bills. 
Ms Roberts has gas central heating in her home in Rhyl, Denbighshire, but said she cannot afford to put it on as much as she needs to keep it warm.
She tries to put it on once a week to prevent the small redbrick two bedroom house from becoming damp.
But when she ran the heating for 10 hours overnight once this week, Ms Roberts used up £15 of the £40 credit she had on her gas smart meter.
""You have to air the house every now and again, because the cold comes up through the floorboards,"" said Ms Roberts, who estimates her bills would be hundreds of pounds more each month if she was to use her central heating as much as she would like.
keep her bills under control, Ms Roberts, who has arthritis and poor circulation, relies on a small electric heater instead, which she keeps by her bed. It costs between £6 and £10 each night she leaves it on. 
She has had a triple heart bypass, and wears extra layers, and at least two pairs of socks in a bid to keep the worst of the cold at bay.
Her home of more than 30 years has a kitchen, and two living areas. She has moved her kettle and a TV set into her bedroom, so she can remain upstairs in the one room as much as possible. 
Ms Roberts said that having been born in the last years of World War Two, and lived through the tough post-war years, she said she can cope with the bleak conditions she faces now. But her real fear is for her children and grandchildren in the years ahead if the cost of heating a home continues to spiral upwards. 
""I want to stick up for the children because eventually they are not going to be able to afford to keep warm.
""The way they are carrying on, with the central heating - up and up and up - people will have to have coal fires again, and they'll be burning rubbish to survive.""

Friends of the Earth has identified 100 of the coldest neighbourhoods in Wales and England for the campaign. Rhyl is among those with houses which are hardest to heat, with bills higher than average, and where most people are also living on low incomes. 
As part of its United for Warm Homes campaign, the group is urging the Welsh government to urgently introduce its new Warm Homes programme, to help those most in need, and through street-by-street insulation in neighbourhoods. 
Catriona Currie, warm homes campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said there are millions of people facing an ""incredibly bleak"" winter ahead.
""We've heard how people are making every adjustment they can to ease the enormous cost pressures they're facing. 
""Harrowing stories like the ones captured in these striking photos are shamefully all too common right now.
""No-one should have to live in a freezing home, just so they can afford to pay for food or meet other rising living costs.""
A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are working hard to support people during the cost of living crisis - targeting help to those who need it the most and continuing to provide programmes which put money back in people's pockets.
""We have bold ambitions to meet our energy needs through renewable sources and are currently rolling out a wide range of measures to increase the energy efficiency of homes across the country.""

politics	Northern Ireland Protocol: Poots denies letter tried to dilute bill	"former Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots has dismissed a report that he tried to dilute the Northern Ireland Protocol bill.
x-DUP leader responded to a Financial Times article which suggested he wrote to the government to argue Northern Ireland's farmers would be better off under the protocol.
DUP has blocked Northern Ireland's executive and assembly from forming in its protest against the protocol.
Mr Poots has said he supports the bill.
He added the legislation, which would override parts of the protocol, is ""necessary to deal with the constitutional and economic damage being done to Northern Ireland"".
rotocol keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU's single market for goods to ensure free trade can continue across the Irish land border post-Brexit. 
It has, however, in turn angered unionist politicians by adding new checks to some goods being moved between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
DUP has said this undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position and the party has, since February, withheld its support for the formation of Stormont's governing executive.
rty said there appears to be ""some people in London who mischievously are out to cast doubt on the DUP's determination to get rid of the NI Protocol - their tactics will fail"". 
""The party did not at any time consider tabling amendments to the bill to reflect anything contained in the letter which was sent by Mr Poots in his ministerial rather than party capacity and which was never discussed by the party,"" it added.
On Friday, it was reported that Mr Poots wrote to the then-UK environment, food and rural affairs secretary, George Eustice.
It said Mr Poots argued it was ""unacceptable"" that the protocol bill would force farmers to accept the same agricultural subsidy as the rest of the UK.
In response, Mr Poots has said he ""reasonably suggested one change which would maximise the UK's ability to use state aid under World Trade Organisation rules"".
A new subsidy system is expected to come fully into force in the UK from 4 January, which is designed to allow the devolved regions to deliver subsidies tailored for their needs.
wspaper reported that Mr Poots could not recall if he received a response from London.
UK government and the EU resumed talks in recent weeks about the protocol, while the legislation continues to progress through parliament. 
raditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister accused Mr Poots of putting ""expediency before principle"" by writing the letter, to which Mr Poots replied ""it does not dilute the bill in any way, on the contrary it makes it better""."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63762220
politics	Cost of living: Raise tax to help the poorest, says STUC	"Scottish ministers are being urged to use their tax raising powers to help fund public sector pay rises and provide more help for the poorest.
Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) says this week's budget could raise an extra £1.3bn to help address the cost of living crisis. 
STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said it was time for politicians to be ""stepping up to the plate"".
Scottish government said Scotland already had a progressive tax system.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison refused to reveal what might be in Thursday's budget statement, but said Scotland's tax system already took more from those ""with broader shoulders"".
Scotland, like other parts of the UK is facing a wave of strikes this winter by public sector workers who want increases that reflect the soaring cost of living. 
A STUC report has proposed a range of measures to raise more money within the scope of the Scottish government's devolved powers. 
STUC estimates this could raise an extra £1.3bn of additional revenue a year, with an extra £2bn possible through more complex reforms to the tax system in the longer term. 
General secretary Roz Foyer said she sympathised with the Scottish government because she believed it should be getting more support from Westminster - but she insisted there were measures available to it. 
She told the BBC's The Sunday Show: ""While we're facing the next two years of a UK Tory government that is no friend of ordinary people and will continue to make our lives worse, we need radical action from the Scottish government who claim to be on the people's side.""
Ms Foyer said that while strikes - particularly at Christmas - may cause disruption, many workers felt they had no other option.
""I have never seen such high public support for strike action,"" she siad. ""I think the reason for that is because 80% of workers out there are in the same boat.""
'People are happy to see someone fighting for them'
She added: ""There's a real fear. People can't sustain their lives. People are not getting Christmas anyway because they can't afford it.
""At the end of the day I think people are quite happy to see somebody fighting back for them because right now the politicians are failing us. So right now I want to see them stepping up to the plate and showing us they are on  our side.""
Shona Robison, cabinet secretary for social justice, housing and local government, said the Scottish government's budget had fallen by 10% in real terms due to inflation. 
She also highlighted measures that had been put in place to help families such as the Scottish Child Payment and the Fuel Insecurity Fund. 
She told the Sunday Show: ""We are looking to see what more we can do but we have very limited tax raising powers, we have very limited borrowing powers.
""Despite that we have a more progressive taxation here in Scotland and we have helped with public sector pay, putting £700m into the pockets of public sector workers to help people with this cost of living crisis.""
Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith said Scotland already had the highest income tax rates in the UK. 
She said: ""Any widening of the tax differential would put us at an even greater competitive disadvantage.
""Those on the 41p rate are not by any means top earners - they are middle-income Scots who are already feeling the squeeze from the cost of living crisis."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63934633
politics	Boris Johnson had backing to challenge Rishi Sunak, Sir Graham Brady confirms	"""It's pretty bad, isn't it?"" - Sir Graham Brady on meeting before Liz Truss resigned as PM
Boris Johnson had signed up enough MPs to mount a challenge to Rishi Sunak for the Conservative leadership, senior Tory Sir Graham Brady has confirmed.
Mr Johnson dramatically pulled out of the race amid speculation he did not have the 100 nominations needed.
But Sir Graham, who runs Tory leadership contests, said Mr Johnson had just decided not to stand.
He also spoke for the first time about his meeting with Liz Truss when she realised she could not go on as PM.
He said the chat was ""the easiest and most straightforward"" of the three similar conversations he has held with Conservative leaders facing the end of their time in power ""because she had come to the same conclusion"" as him.
As chairman of the powerful 1922 backbench committee, it falls to Sir Graham to deliver the bad news to Tory leaders clinging to power that they no longer command the support of their MPs.
In an interview with BBC North West Tonight, Sir Graham said he had decided to call Downing Street to tell Ms Truss her position was ""unsustainable,"" following ""utter chaos"" during one of the final Commons votes of her administration.
Confusion over whether the vote on fracking was a confidence vote in her came amid crumbling support for her doomed premiership from Tory MPs.
""I was reaching for my phone when I got a message saying the prime minister had asked to see me,"" the Altrincham and Sale West MP told the programme.
""When I went in to see her with her chief of staff Mark Fullbrook, she asked me the question - she said 'it's pretty bad, isn't it?' To which I replied 'yes, it is pretty bad'"".
""She asked the second question, 'do you think it's retrievable?'. And I said 'no, I don't think it is'. And she replied that she didn't either.""
By contrast, he recalled a meeting with Mr Johnson the night before he announced his resignation in July this year, when he was ""still determined to go on"".
""He [Mr Johnson] mulled it over after that, and he called me early the next morning to say that he'd changed his mind.""
Mr Johnson was forced to resign after a mass walkout of ministers, including his former chancellor Mr Sunak, following a string of scandals. 
He tried to make a sensational comeback after Ms Truss resigned, attempting to muster the 100 nominations from Tory MPs required to make it through to an online ballot of party members.
But after flying back from a Caribbean holiday, he dramatically announced he would not be standing, even though he had 102 backers, including a proposer and a seconder.
In a statement, he said putting himself forward would not be ""the right thing to do"" for party unity.
His decision to pull out meant Mr Sunak became Tory leader automatically as the only MP to make it to the ballot stage.
uncement was greeted with some scepticism within Westminster, given only around half that number had gone public with their support for Mr Johnson.
But Sir Graham said ""two candidates"" had reached the threshold, and ""one of them decided not to then submit his nomination"".
Elsewhere in his interview, Sir Graham insisted the committee had wanted to involve party members in the leadership race, despite setting a ""very high"" nomination threshold to speed up the contest.
""We thought it was in the national interest to get a result as quickly as possible - but wanted to make sure we weren't closing that possibility that the members would also have a vote,"" he said."	/news/uk-politics-63503932
politics	Cost of living: Wales' social housing rent rises limited to 6.5%	"Rent increases for social housing tenants will be capped at 6.5% from 2023, the Welsh government has said.
re will also be no evictions for cash-strapped tenants who talk to their landlords.
Social landlords have promised to invest in existing homes, according to the Welsh government.
Community Housing Cymru, which represents Wales' housing associations, said 75% of tenants have all or some of their rent paid by benefits.
Minister Julie James said: ""No social tenant will experience any change in their rent until April 2023, but I do need to set rents for the next financial year now to give the sector time to plan.""
She added that tenants who paid their own rent need to be protected from slipping into financial difficulties while trying to keep a roof over their head.
Welsh Conservatives housing spokeswoman Janet Finch-Saunders said it was disappointing rent caps were being used to combat rent rises which she blamed on a ""Labour-made housing crisis"".
She claimed only 6,000 houses were being built every year which was ""less than half of what we need"".
""Labour must address the root of the housing crisis in Wales and not look to paper over the cracks that they themselves have caused,"" she said.
Plaid Cymru's housing and planning spokesman, Mabon ap Gwynfor, said it was important the 6.5% figure was not used as a target.
He urged housing associations to create support funds to help tenants in need who were not on benefits.
He said: ""During this cost-of-living crisis, it's important that Welsh government does all it can to protect all tenants and I would urge them to immediately bring in a ban on all evictions over this winter period."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63653568
politics	Parkinson's: 'Lack of specialist care for Wales patients'	"A charity representing patients living with Parkinson's has criticised the lack of specialist care in Wales.
Parkinson's UK Cymru describes care for those living with the disease in Wales as a ""postcode lottery"". 
Former rugby player Antony Evans, who was diagnosed aged 42, said medics did not consider Parkinson's because of his age. 
Welsh government said it has created a roadmap for health boards to meet demand for support services.
rity said about 7,600 people in Wales are known to live with the disease in Wales, with 23 full-time specialist nurses to care for them.
It is a progressive condition affecting the part of the brain which creates a chemical called dopamine and impairs the body's ability to control movement. There is no known cure.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) it is the fastest-growing neurological condition in the world.
According to Antony, now 49, there is a lack of knowledge and understanding about the condition even within the medical profession.
He received his diagnosis seven years ago, while undergoing an unrelated back operation.
""Physios missed it and other doctors missed it because of my age. That's something which seriously needs to become more prevalent in GPs - people under 40 can certainly get Parkinson's.""
""I was given Karate Kid, 'wax on, wax off' exercises. I had very shiny windows, but it was all for nothing. They didn't consider Parkinson's because I was 42 years of age.""
In the late 90s and early 00s, Antony played second row for the Caerphilly rugby team which secured 10 successive promotions, from the local rugby doldrums to the Welsh Premier Division. 
He was part of the team that secured a win on French soil (a Challenge Cup match away to Racing Club de France in 1998, which Caerphilly won 20-31) and lined up against Pau, Brive and Perpignan in European competition for the Cheesemen.
But Parkinson's has been difficult for the formerly athletic and abrasive Evans to come to terms with.
""I was over 18 stone (114kg), I'm now 13 stone (82kg). That takes your confidence away. It takes away your physical strength. You lose a bit of confidence, and the feeling you can defend your family.""
Some mornings, he has difficulty brushing his hair or teeth, and is frustrated by the lack of progress in understanding and treating the condition.
""Parkinson's controls me at the moment. If the medication doesn't work, I can't do much. That's very difficult to come to terms with.""
""The medication used to treat Parkinson's is the same as what was used in the 1950s. ""
""At the moment, more attention is been given to neurological diseases and conditions, like MND, dementia and Alzheimer's. But Parkinson's is the fastest growing neurological condition worldwide. 
""But there's not as much buzz from the media, from institutions and so forth to it.""
""Every health board in Britain needs to get on the Parkinson's train"".
In a bid to raise more awareness of the condition, Antony and others have rebranded a Cardiff-based football team for those living with the condition.
Phoenix 681 FC meet for training every Monday evening on the outskirts of Cardiff. All players live with Parkinson's or are affected by the condition in some way through family or friends.
681 in the name refers to the chemical number for dopamine, the chemical lacking in those living with Parkinson's.
m's purpose is twofold, with exercise recommended for those living with the condition but also to create a forum where players can discuss and support others in a similar situation.
Next week, they will participate in a tournament in Cardiff for teams representing those living with Parkinson's. 
Antony and other members of Phoenix 681 FC hope the team and the tournament can help raise awareness of Parkinson's and encourage more funding and research to help others who will receive the same diagnosis.
He is currently part of a medicinal trial travelling regularly to Nottingham for week-long sessions under intense observation. With Parkinson's a progressive disease, he hopes attempts to raise awareness and find new treatments will be successful.
""I try and stop myself thinking about the future. To be honest, I don't think anything will help me before I pop out of stage door left.""
""If I can do something in terms of testing treatments which may help others in future, that what keeps me going, to help try and find a cure in future.""
Welsh government said: ""Next month we will publish a quality statement for neurological conditions which sets out the outcomes and standards we expect health boards to achieve in delivering those services.
""Last month we published a new rehabilitation framework which sets out how health boards can meet the increasing demand for rehabilitation, reablement and recovery services. 
""In addition we fund Health and Care Research Wales, who offer grants for medical research in Wales and has also supported clinical trials for Parkinson's."""	/news/uk-wales-63497238
politics	Clive Lewis: Labour criticises MP's 'concentration camp' comment	"Labour MP Clive Lewis criticises proposals to house asylum seekers in disused holiday camps
Labour has criticised one of its own MPs for comparing government plans to house asylum seekers in disused holiday parks to a ""concentration camp"" policy. 
Clive Lewis told the BBC that ""if you put a group of people concentrated into a camp - as you did in South Africa in the Boer War - it's what you call a concentration camp"". 
A Labour spokesman said the comments were ""clearly not appropriate"".
Downing Street has defended the proposals.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak set out plans on Tuesday to move migrants from hotels to disused holiday camps, former students halls and surplus military sites, while they wait for a decision on their asylum claim.
His official spokesman said Mr Lewis's claim was not an appropriate comparison and any accommodation would come with ""the right levels of support"". 
A Labour spokesman said it would be a matter for the whips whether Mr Lewis should face disciplinary action. 
Asked if leader Sir Keir Starmer would urge the Norwich South MP not to repeat the remarks, the spokesman said: ""Yes.""
Responding to the asylum housing plans on BBC Two's Politics Live, Mr Lewis said: ""It's a concentration of people.... Look what they're talking about - putting people in camps en masse because of their [the government's] mess.
""Let's just be really clear where we are - that is the technical term for it, a concentration of people in a camp.""
Former Conservative minister Damian Green, who was also appearing on the show, described the comments as ""ridiculous"".
Mr Sunak unveiled plans to tackle the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats and the backlog of asylum cases in the Commons on Tuesday.

politics	SNP MP John Nicolson to be investigated over Speaker tweet	"An SNP MP has been referred to the parliamentary privileges committee after he shared the contents of a private letter from the Speaker.
John Nicolson was accused of a ""clear breach"" of parliamentary rules for tweeting details of the letter from Sir Lindsay Hoyle.
Mr Nicolson said he was ""deeply sorry"" that Sir Lindsay was upset and insisted there had been ""no malicious intent"". 
MPs voted by 371 to 16 to refer him to the committee. 
All 16 of those who voted against were SNP MPs, with the party's remaining 28 MPs - including Mr Nicolson himself - not taking part in the vote. 
mmittee will investigate the circumstances and report back on its findings - and any disciplinary measures it recommends - to the Commons.
Mr Nicolson was rebuked by Sir Lindsay last week for posting details of a confidential letter regarding a decision not to refer former Conservative culture secretary Nadine Dorries to the privileges committee. 
row relates to claims made to the committee by Ms Dorries earlier this year that a Channel 4 documentary she appeared in had used ""paid actors"" who were pretending to be people living in poverty. 
Her comments about the Tower Block of Commons programme came as the government prepared to privatise the broadcaster. 
An investigation by Channel 4 and the show's production company found no evidence to support her allegations. 
Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee, of which Mr Nicolson is a member, was highly critical of Ms Dorries and said she should have corrected the record.
But its report did not recommend that she be referred to the privileges committee.
Mr Nicolson, a former BBC presenter, later tweeted a video in which he said: ""I sent a copy of the report to Mr Speaker, and he's responded and I thought I should update you on what he said. 
""He says that he's considered my letter, but he's decided to take no further action and not to refer Nadine Dorries to the Privileges Committee. 
""In other words, she'll suffer no consequences for what she's done. And I thought you should know."" 
, which still appears on Mr Nicolson's Twitter feed, sparked an angry online backlash against Sir Lindsay. 
Sir Lindsay said at the time that Mr Nicolson had ""seen fit to give a partial and biased account of my letter on Twitter"", had ""misled the people of this country"" and had ""put me in a bad light with the people of this country"".
A motion to debate Mr Nicolson's behaviour was tabled in the Commons by Conservative MP David Davis, who accused the Ochil and South Perthshire MP of attempting to blame the Speaker for Ms Dorries not being referred to the watchdog.
Mr Davis said the recommendations of the DCMS committee were unanimous, and Mr Nicolson had not voted against them. 
Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Davis said: ""Nowhere in his filmed statement did he tell his followers that Mr Speaker was following normal precedent or normal procedure by accepting the will of the DCMS Committee.
""All of us in this House have a duty to uphold its rules and institutions, but by knowingly breaching the confidentiality of the Speaker's correspondence he has done the opposite of that. This is a clear breach of our rules.""
Mr Nicolson told MPs that he was ""deeply sorry that the Speaker is upset"", adding: ""I don't conduct politics in a way - for those who know me - that ever aims to be offensive"".
He said: ""I hope the House concludes that there was no malicious intent in anything that I did and I apologise to the Speaker for breaching a House rule.
""Given the all-party nature of the committee report, I sought no party political advantage and I hope that members here today will seek no party political advantage. 
""My only motivation was to do what I always try to do and that is to engage with debate and to communicate my work here with constituents and with journalists as openly and fairly as I can."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63798629
politics	How does Westminster chaos affect Scottish debate?	"UK is set for its third prime minister in the space of three months, with Westminster again gripped by political turbulence. With Holyrood about to come back from its October holidays, how does the debate impact on parties in Scotland?
Popcorn supplies may have run low in the households of most MSPs over the last couple of days, as they watched the Conservative UK government implode again.
xtent, devolved politics can drift serenely on - Holyrood has been in recess for the past fortnight, and has normal business scheduled for the coming week.
Indeed, it has its own rows to focus on, with legislation to reform the Gender Recognition Act set for its first full debate on Thursday.
MSPs have also been promised a statement from Deputy First Minister John Swinney about an emergency budget review, with inflation ripping a hole in the government's budgets.
But many may still struggle to tear their eyes away from the drama unfolding at Downing Street, which could have huge implications for every party.
Scottish Tory MSPs are in a somewhat sheepish mood at the moment - tinged with frustration at the ever-deepening crisis in the UK party. 
's particularly true of those who backed Liz Truss. The nine MSPs who penned an article in the Times hailing her ""bold and ambitious plan for the country and economy"" are unlikely to have it framed on the wall.
re exactly the sort of quotes they don't want to resurface now: ""Her serious style of leadership and her ability to deliver results in government are exactly what we need.""
Even beyond Ms Truss's direct backers, many are privately annoyed at being sent out to defend UK party policies which were ditched within days, burning their own political capital.
And with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt set to wield the axe on public budgets regardless of who wins, they know there are going to be more tough messages to sell.
Leader Douglas Ross is in a particularly awkward position, and is again refusing to publicly take a side in the latest contest in the hope of fostering good relations with whoever wins.
would be extremely difficult if the new prime minister turns out to be the old prime minister, with the return of Boris Johnson - the nightmare outcome for Mr Ross, and indeed the bulk of Scottish Tories.
Almost all of the Holyrood group jumped in behind Mr Ross when he called on Mr Johnson to resign in the wake of the ""partygate"" row.
His subsequent u-turns on that prompted questions about his own future, so it is difficult to see how he could take yet another position by welcoming Mr Johnson back with open arms.
Nicola Sturgeon said the resignation of Liz Truss was ""beyond parody""
question every non-Conservative politician in Scotland has been asking is why this should just be a choice for the 172,000 Tory members - why not let the nation choose in a general election?
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says it's a ""democratic imperative"". Labour are also keen to paint themselves as a ""government in waiting"".
mmediate barrier to that is the survival instinct of Conservative MPs, who are looking at Armageddon-level polling. The party is in an extremely vulnerable state, and turkeys are rarely keen to vote for a Christmas election.
All six Scottish Tory seats would be considered marginal - with majorities under 10% - so really none of them would feel confident of keeping their jobs.
But you can't rule an election out, because the Conservative Party has demonstrated a real knack in recent months for blowing itself up.
Discipline is a forgotten concept and Mr Johnson returning to No 10 may be the final straw for an already fractured party. Things could fall apart quite easily were that to happen. 
Equally, the new prime minister might feel the best way to stabilise things is to promise to go back to the country sometime next year, placating the public somewhat while providing time to regain ground.
Mr Johnson would also be the dream result for the SNP, who absolutely loved campaigning against him. 
Many of their digital ads during the UK, Holyrood and council polls of 2019, 2021 and 2022 were literally just a picture of his face.
rty is also in second place in all of the Westminster seats held by the Conservatives, so might be hoping to make gains.
But there is a hint of bigger-picture concern for the SNP in that they have been quite happy for Scottish politics to become a binary contest between themselves and the Tories, as the parties of independence and the union.
If the Conservatives face collapse and people start to see Labour as a realistic government in waiting, that balance could begin to shift.
's why SNP leadership figures started workshopping attack lines at their recent conference in Aberdeen, seeking to tie Labour to Brexit and decrying Sir Keir Starmer as not being a radical enough alternative to the Tories.
Labour themselves are understandably in buoyant mood, confident that things are moving in their direction.
Having regained second spot from the Conservatives in May's local council elections, the Scottish party hopes it can make further gains as part of a UK-wide movement.
raightforward as the polls might make it seem even in a general election, as Labour's target seats north of the border are all held by the SNP - which also paints itself as an anti-Tory vote.
re are actually only four marginal seats where Labour is in second place - and three of them technically no longer have SNP MPs, with two having defected to the Alba Party and another losing the whip over a Covid rule breach. 
It would take a significant swing from the SNP back to Labour for them to make real progress towards recapturing traditional heartlands in places like Glasgow and Fife.
And of course there can be quite a gulf between being confident that something is going to happen eventually, and actually seeing it delivered.
will be a familiar song for supporters of independence, fresh from talk of the ""arc of history"" moving in their direction at the SNP conference.
Ongoing chaos at Westminster is obviously helpful to the campaign, with economic uncertainty allowing the Scottish government to paint independence as a lifeboat rather than a gamble.
But deadlock at Downing Street also means there is precisely zero chance of the UK government signing up to a referendum any time soon.
Whoever takes over from Liz Truss will have plenty on their plate trying to calm MPs and the financial markets, without immediately plunging into a career-defining constitutional contest.
Ms Sturgeon really wants a 2014-style agreement to underpin an internationally-recognised referendum, and even her government's argument to the Supreme Court was based on the idea Westminster would ultimately need to deliver the result of a vote.
So while backers of independence will be enjoying this car-crash immensely, it might not bring their dream any closer to being realised."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63342469

politics	Creative solution needed to fix overbudget family services	"re are calls for a ""creative solution"" to fix Gloucestershire's children and family services, which is currently £11m over budget. 
Liberal Democrat group leader, Ben Evans, said the council needed to invest in preventative services to stop costs from spiralling.
Cabinet member Stephen Davies said the council already had a strategy.
""We have both a short-term plan to address the overspend and a longer term strategy to reduce costs,"" he said.
Mr Evans, who has worked in youth work sector for more than a decade, said the increase in children needing help from the council was directly linked to a decrease in early intervention services such as youth workers. 
He said officers had warned decision makers of the financial consequences of stripping back services in 2010.
""We were clearly warning that if you take away early intervention and prevention, in 10 years time you are going to have a budget that runs out of control,"" he said.  
Churchdown councillor said the authority should look at ""creative"" ways to bolster the service, such as match-funding and more philanthropic models. 
Mr Evans said: ""There's a huge area of social investment which is growing in the UK, which in Gloucestershire we haven't tapped in to.
""For example there are wealthy people who want a financial return but also a social return for investments. 
""So if our council was showing real leadership, they'd be saying we're going to put 'X' amount of money in, and we're trying to get it matched by people, and that's the kind of creativity we need.""
Latest figures show there are 872 children in care in Gloucestershire of whom 491 have some form of expensive out-of-county care.
uncil said the overspend was ""partly due to the increasing numbers of children in care and the cost of placements,"" both of which it described as ""national issues"".
Gloucestershire County Council's Children's Services are ranked as requires improvement by regulator Ofsted after previously being classed as 'inadequate' for five years. 
According to the government 45% of local authorities in England either have an inadequate or requires improvement Ofsted rating.
revor Doughty is the former director of Cornwall Council's Children's Services which was rated as outstanding by Ofsted.
He oversaw its move from inadequate to outstanding within eight years and said: ""One thing we didn't do in Cornwall when we were under all kinds of financial pressure is take money out of early help. 
""But it does take time, and there are examples of authorities who have done it quickly and superficially and then are back being 'inadequate' in a couple of years.
""What I was always very insistent on is that it was about getting the foundations right, which can take a while and I'm talking years rather than months."" 
Gloucestershire County Council said it had responded to some ""particularly difficult cases"" in 2022 that were very costly. 
Stephen Davies, the cabinet member responsible for children's safeguarding and early years, said: ""Our budget is based on a prediction of how many children will need our help, and what sort of help they will need so it can change throughout the year.""
He said the long-term strategy included developing children's home support to avoid entry into care, and developing their own placement capacity with providers to help control costs. 
""Our priority remains ensuring children across the county get the care and support they need,"" he added.

politics	Penny Mordaunt moves first in race to replace Liz Truss	"Penny Mordaunt has become the first Conservative MP to say they will run to replace Liz Truss as prime minister.
Commons leader said she was standing to ""unite our country"" and win the next general election.
Rishi Sunak is yet to confirm he is standing, but he has already amassed 87 of the 100 endorsements from MPs he would need to take part. 
Boris Johnson has not ruled out a comeback, months after being forced out of No 10 after a Tory revolt.
former prime minister - who is currently out of the country - has 44 MPs backing him. Ms Mordaunt currently trails both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak, with only 21 public supporters.
International Trade Minister James Duddridge, a former parliamentary aide to Mr Johnson, has told the BBC: ""Boris is coming, and he has the momentum and support. He is coming home and is up for it.  
""He is the only election winner we have that has a proven track record in London, on Brexit, and in gaining the mandate we have now.""  
Ms Mordaunt is currently Commons leader and was briefly defence secretary under Theresa May.
49-year-old Portsmouth North MP backed Brexit and has worked hard to build up her profile with party activists, but did not get enough support from MPs to reach the members' ballot last time.
ry party bosses have decided contenders will need 100 nominations from fellow Conservative MPs, a much higher threshold than normal, meaning no more than three MPs will be able to stand.
Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has ruled himself out of the contest, adding he is ""leaning towards"" backing Boris Johnson.
He told reporters Mr Johnson had a ""mandate"" from the 2019 general election and ""could win the next election"".
Mr Sunak has won a high-level endorsement of his own, with former chancellor and home secretary Sajid Javid backing his leadership bid.
ry MP Angela Richardson said on Friday she had signed Mr Sunak's ""nomination papers for Conservative Party leader"". 
Ms Richardson, who has already declared her support for Mr Sunak, described this as a ""positive end to an extraordinary week in Westminster"". 
Earlier this week, the leader of the Commons Penny Mordaunt told MPs the prime minister was not ""under her desk"" hiding when she stood in for Ms Truss at the despatch box. 
It sounded more mischievous than helpful and Ms Mordaunt's own ambition to sit behind the No 10 desk has never been in doubt. 
She is hoping for early momentum by breaking cover first. Rishi Sunak currently has the most publicly declared support among Tory MPs and the former chancellor is expected to announce he's running soon.
will both pitch themselves as unifying candidates. 
With the threshold for nominations set so high, a maximum of three candidates can reach the first ballot on Monday. 
g question heading into the weekend is whether Boris Johnson attempts to boomerang back into Downing Street. 
former prime minister has already got a couple of Cabinet endorsements but other Tory MPs are horrified at the idea of Mr Johnson making a comeback. 
It's a prospect that splits Conservative MPs between delight and despair. The chance of a backroom deal and simple coronation seems to be receding as the rival campaigns fire up.
If Mr Johnson did make a comeback it would be unprecedented in modern British political history, coming three months after he was forced out by his own MPs following a string of scandals.
ry MP Jesse Norman, one of scores of ministers to quit his government over the summer, said bringing him back would be an ""absolutely catastrophic decision"".
And former Conservative leader Lord Hague told Times Radio it ""would be going round in circles"" and ""could become a death spiral"" for the party. 
""I think it's possibly the worst idea I've heard of in the 46 years I've been a member of the Conservative Party,"" he said.
Polling suggests he remains popular with Tory members, but another tilt at the leadership could prove divisive among Tory MPs, some of whom have said they would quit politics if he came back.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has ruled himself out of the race, along with Security Minister Tom Tugendhat and former cabinet minister Michael Gove.
Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman and International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch are thought to be considering bids.
Contenders have until 14:00 BST on Monday to find 100 backers. If three reach the threshold, Conservative MPs will knock out one contender in a ballot on the same day.
MPs will hold an ""indicative"" ballot of the final two, with the winner then decided in an online vote of party members, to finish next Friday."	/news/uk-politics-63348370

politics	Rishi Sunak: The most urgent problems facing the new prime minister	"Rishi Sunak has become the UK's new prime minister, replacing Liz Truss. He inherits a number of challenges from his predecessor, as BBC correspondents explain.
Faisal Islam, Economics Editor
Rishi Sunak enters No 10 having made very few promises in his leadership campaign, but as chancellor he warned about the danger of rapidly rising prices. 
A key challenge for him will be what to do with the Energy Price Guarantee - the subsidy scheme to help homes and businesses cope with higher gas and electricity bills. Under Liz Truss, the scheme was set to last for two years. New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt then announced that the guarantee would only last until April. 
We know Mr Sunak was also cautious about offering the scheme beyond that point. But a typical household energy bill - now £2,500 - could rise to more than £4,000 next spring, sending inflation rocketing.
Meanwhile, Mr Sunak had guaranteed that benefits, tax credits and pensions would rise in line with the recent inflation rate of 10.1%. But with a huge borrowing gap of £30-40bn, it is not clear whether that promise still holds.
At the moment, the financial markets trust Mr Sunak, which makes the economic repair job he has to do easier. Markets have sent government borrowing costs lower and this in turn could lead to more favourable mortgage rates. It could also mean we see the Bank of England raise interest rates by a smaller amount.

With record numbers waiting for hospital treatment and the threat of strikes over pay and winter just around the corner, Mr Sunak will be firefighting from day one. Any attempts to introduce his own policies and vision are likely to have to wait. 
During the summer, Mr Sunak spoke on several occasions about waste and bureaucracy, floating the idea of a vaccine-style taskforce to improve efficiency, and charging patients £10 for missed appointments. 
re is scepticism within the health service about the merits of these ideas, but they suggest he will take a tough line in terms of savings - perhaps not cutting the budget, but asking the service to do more with the same amount - and try to get on top of the backlog faster than has been timetabled for so far. 
Key to this will be tackling delayed discharges - the patients who are ready to leave hospital but cannot because of a lack of care available in the community. The fact Mr Sunak was willing to raise National Insurance contributions - a move now scrapped - to help increase investment in the NHS points to this being an immediate area of focus.

f thousands of workers have already downed tools this year, among them train drivers, dock workers, mail employees, criminal barristers and telecoms staff. University lecturers have just voted for strike action, while nurses, junior doctors and teachers are among those considering strikes.
Although most disputes involve a range of issues, the common factor has been pay. Price rises are pushing up the cost of living, and wages have not been keeping up.
So unions are flexing their muscles to demand more money for their members. But if companies pay their workers more, they may have to charge higher prices for what they produce or sell - meaning higher prices for everyone.
A government already struggling to balance its books is unlikely to want to pay public sector workers much more either. But the new prime minister will be desperate to avoid the current bout of industrial unrest gathering momentum.
Legislation to limit the impact of transport strikes is already on the table. But it is likely the priority will be to solve the problem at source - and that means controlling inflation.
James Landale, Diplomatic Correspondent
UK policy towards Ukraine will not change under Mr Sunak. While standing for the leadership in the summer, he said he would maintain Britain's backing and make an early visit to Kyiv. ""If I become prime minister, I will redouble our efforts and reinforce our policy of total support for Ukraine that Boris has so ably led,"" he said. 
But continuing to give Ukraine military support in the long term will cost money, and there is uncertainty over Mr Sunak's approach to defence spending. 
Ms Truss promised to increase defence spending from 2% to 3% of national wealth - measured by gross domestic product - by 2030. But Mr Sunak has said that target was ""arbitrary"" and ""not a plan"". 
He may also have to face the challenge of supporting Ukraine when doing so becomes less popular politically. With rising energy costs exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis, Mr Sunak may have to persuade voters their financial discomfort is a price worth paying to defend Ukraine.

Rishi Sunak faces the same problematic Northern Ireland in-tray which awaited Ms Truss in September.
re is still no Northern Ireland Executive, and the legislative assembly cannot function. Talks continue on the Northern Ireland Protocol, but, as yet, there is no resolution which would satisfy the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
It has blocked normal government in Belfast in its protest against the protocol, meaning a key deadline looms large. Unless the DUP drops its demands or emergency legislation is rushed through by 28 October, then an election must be held within 12 weeks - which could mean a second assembly election in the space of a year.
During hustings in Belfast in August, Mr Sunak pledged to progress a bill to override much of the protocol, but his preference would be a negotiated compromise.
Without imminent progress, Stormont's power will shift from local ministers to the secretary of state and civil servants within days. Festive cheer could be in short supply unless someone blinks."	/news/uk-63373258
politics	Immigration will be very important for the economy, says Jeremy Hunt	"Immigration will be important for the UK economy in the years ahead but the government still wants to bring numbers down, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said. 
Official forecasts say net migration in 2026 will be 205,000, higher than previously predicted.
Office for Budget Responsibility said it would help ""offset slower growth in productivity"".
Mr Hunt said the UK needed migrants but he wants to improve skills ""at home"" to lower dependence on foreign workers.
He also said Brexit had created trade barriers with the EU, but ruled out re-joining the single market. 
r was speaking a day after delivering his Autumn Statement in which he announced tax rises and a squeeze on public spending. 
He defended his actions arguing that tough decisions were needed to tackle inflation. 
Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme migration had a ""very positive"" effect on the economy but stressed the need to improve the skills of people already in the country in order to reduce the levels of migration ""we need"".
""That is why education is a big priority,"" he said. 
Department for Education was one of the few government departments to receive additional funding in Mr Hunt's Autumn Statement, getting an extra £2.3bn for schools in England.  
Conservatives have long promised to reduce net migration, with former Prime Minister David Cameron pledging - although ultimately failing - to get numbers down to the tens of thousands.
In October, when Liz Truss was prime minister, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the target was her ""ultimate aspiration"" but added ""we've got to take it slowly"".
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has also said he wants to get migration down ""over time"", but insists his focus is on tackling illegal migration. 
Speaking on Friday morning, the chancellor argued that rising levels of illegal migration would undermine the public's support for legal migration - which he said was a positive both for the economy and society.
Also appearing on the Today programme, Richard Hughes - head of the Office for Budget Responsibility - explained that the government forecaster had revised its estimates for migration up, after an expected drop in numbers had not materialised.
He said the OBR had anticipated numbers would fall following the creation of a post-Brexit immigration regime. 
He added that despite new rules, the UK was still letting in a net level of over 200,000 people a year and that the OBR therefore predicted net migration levels would stand at 205,000 from 2026, rather than earlier estimates of 129,000.
OBR still expects net migration to fall over the next five years, but from a higher base than it originally expected. 
In its forecast which accompanied Mr Hunt's Autumn Statement, the OBR said Brexit had had a ""significant adverse impact"" on UK trade and predicted that the UK's trade intensity would be 15% lower than if the UK had remained in the EU. 
r was asked if re-joining the EU's single market - a free trade area which removes tariffs and taxes on trade between member countries - could boost growth.
Mr Hunt responded that ""having unfettered trade with our neighbours and countries all over the world is very beneficial to growth""
He expressed the hope that over the coming years the UK would be able to remove trade barriers with the EU, while remaining outside the single market.
""It will take time,"" he added. 
He argued that re-joining the single market was not ""the right way to boost growth"" and would be going against ""what people voted for"" in the Brexit referendum.

politics	MP Julian Knight accuses Tory party of denying right to fair hearing	"Julian Knight has accused the Conservative Party of denying him the right to a fair hearing, after he was suspended as a Tory MP following a report to police involving allegations of sexual assault.
Mr Knight said he was ""entirely innocent of any wrongdoing whatsoever"". 
In a letter to the party's chief whip, Simon Hart, Mr Knight strongly objected to the way he was named by the whip's office on Wednesday night, when they confirmed his suspension from the parliamentary Conservative party. 
He has demanded an ""immediate and unequivocal answer"" as to why he was suspended and publicly named. 
MP for Solihull said the whips - who are responsible for party discipline - must have known their actions would ""entirely prejudice"" any prospect of getting a fair hearing in any inquiry, court or disciplinary hearing. 
""By unilaterally and publicly suspending the whip you have stripped me of the rights to anonymity or a fair hearing in any judicial forum or, indeed, in the court of public opinion,"" he wrote. 
In the letter, posted on his Twitter account on Thursday, Mr Knight said he was making the statement after his name was linked with an ""apparently serious but entirely unspecified offence"". 
He said he was making his letter public ""in the interests of natural justice"" and has asked the chief whip does the same with this reply.
On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the chief whip said in a statement Mr Knight had been suspended as a Conservative MP after a complaint to the Metropolitan Police.
Mr Knight said he found out he had been suspended from the media, after the statement from the chief whip's office was released. 
He said no one from the whip's office spoke to him before his suspension and he had heard nothing from the police about ""any allegation apparently made against me"". 
BBC has been told the chief whip was in touch with Mr Knight on Wednesday night.
But when asked for a response to Mr Knight's position, the chief whip's office would not comment further given the police investigation. 
On Thursday, the Metropolitan Police said that on 28 October it had received allegations of sexual assault against unnamed victims reported to have taken place on unknown dates at undisclosed locations.
In his letter to the chief whip, Mr Knight asked whether his suspension was related to those allegations.
ment added: ""On 7 December, a further referral relating to the incident[s] was made and an investigation was launched.""
Police said inquiries were ongoing and there have been no arrests.
In a tweet earlier, Mr Knight said he believed his suspension was ""wrong and unjustified"".

politics	Rishi Sunak promises to call out Putin's regime at G20	"Rishi Sunak is promising to ""call out Putin's regime"" at a gathering of world leaders in Indonesia. 
rime minister is travelling to Bali on Sunday afternoon for a summit of the G20 - the world's biggest economies. 
British officials had prepared for this get-together assuming Russia's president would be there. 
rime minister was expected to join other world leaders in condemning Vladimir Putin to his face. 
But Moscow said last week he wouldn't be attending and the Kremlin would be sending Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, instead.
So the words of anger will be directed at him. 
Speaking before setting off for Indonesia, the prime minister said: ""Putin's war has caused devastation around the world - destroying lives and plunging the international economy into turmoil. 
""This G20 summit will not be business as usual. We will call out Putin's regime, and lay bare their utter contempt for the kind of international cooperation and respect for sovereignty forums like the G20 represent.""
G20 is a hotchpotch of countries with little in common beyond big economies.  
An economic forum whose members have been hammered, economically, by one of their own, Russia. 
So the backdrop is awkward, to say the least. 
re won't even be one of the basic diplomatic niceties of these gatherings this time, what is known as the family photo, where the leaders pose for a group picture.
r leaders refuse to be seen smiling in the presence of Russia. 
Recent precedent suggests another usual staple of these affairs, what is known as a communique, a set of agreed conclusions published at the close of the summit, probably won't happen either.
Almost three weeks into the job, this is Mr Sunak's second overseas trip as prime minister, after last week's dash to the COP27 climate summit in Egypt.  
He managed to see a good number of fellow European leaders in Sharm el-Sheikh. 
rip to Bali will mean he can meet plenty from the Indo-Pacific region, a part of the world the government has been increasingly focused on since Brexit. 
And, perhaps, a first chance to meet US President Joe Biden.
Meanwhile, back home, as Laura Kuenssberg writes, the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will continue preparing what is called the Autumn Statement, a budget in all but name, to be delivered on Thursday, just hours after the prime minister gets back home. 
Downing Street is seeking to frame both the summit and the Autumn Statement as responses to the same shock: the consequences of the war in Ukraine. 
A desperate global economic situation, as they describe it, with big domestic implications, that they seek to be trusted to grapple with, after the chaos of the Liz Truss administration.

With thresholds frozen many will pay more in income tax as pay rises.
Welsh government can expect £1.2bn extra over two years, but Labour ministers are unlikely to say it is enough to cover inflation.
rgy price guarantee will rise from £2,500 to £3,000 for the average household, with payments for people on low incomes.
fits and pensions can expect them to increase by inflation next year, while the National Living Wage will rise by 9.7%.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: ""This is a balanced plan for stability, a plan for growth and a plan for public services.""
Labour Welsh government Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said she was ""really disappointed"" by an Autumn Statement which ""just doesn't come close to meeting the gap that we've identified in public service provision"".
""That's because mainly because of inflation and the impact that that's having on the overall Welsh government budget,"" she told BBC Wales.
Cardiff University researchers warned the autumn statement leaves Welsh government ministers with difficult decisions.
freezing of the point that people start to pay income tax means that many will pay more in tax as their wages rise.
Jeremy Hunt announced that the personal allowance threshold will be held at £12,570, and the higher rate will stay at £50,270, until 2028.
wo years longer than already planned. The national insurance threshold will also stay the same.
Currently there are 1,490,000 income tax payers in Wales, with 1,290,000 paying the basic rate and 166,000 on the higher rate.
rate will see their threshold fall from £150,000 to £125,140. 
Currently only 9,000 pay the additional rate in Wales, although that is likely to grow.
Welsh government could vary the rates themselves in Wales, but never has since it had the powers .
gally-mandated minimum wage rate, known as the National Living Wage, will rise by 9.7% to £10.42.
UK government said it would benefit 110,000 people in Wales.
Working age benefits will rise by 10.1%, and pensioners will receive an inflation-matching rise in the state pension and pension credit.
A UK government survey in 2020-21 suggested that Wales had more people in receipt of state support that any other UK nation - 56% versus 52% for the UK as a whole.
way funding works in the UK means that rises in spending in England means extra cash for the Welsh government.
It funds the NHS, social care, councils and other services in Wales.
UK government says Welsh ministers will have an extra £1.2bn to spend over two years, from 2023-2024 to 2024-25.
Its annual budget is worth around £20bn, but Welsh ministers say soaring inflation has wiped out a big chunk of their spending power, with Labour ministers expected to set out their spending plans in December.
Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University said the money could offset ""about four-fifths"" of a over £500m hit inflation has taken to the government's budget in 2024-25.
""But this still leaves a big budget shortfall in the meantime. There will still be plenty of difficult decisions for the Welsh government at next month's budget,"" the centre's Cian Sion wrote.
Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake said: ""Let's be clear - pressures on Welsh public services will continue to worsen after today's statement due to inflation.""
But Tory Chief Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said the Welsh government was getting a ""significant additional sum of money"".
Mr Glen told reporters: ""I think that there is a very significant settlement for the Welsh government that amplifies the advantages of the decisions we've taken in Whitehall and gives them a significant way of mitigating some of the pressures they face.""
Mr Glen - who said he has spoken to Welsh Finance Minister Rebecca Evans three times since he was appointed - denied that the Autumn Statement was a return to austerity, saying it would reduce the size of the recession ""and we hope the length of it"".
But a Welsh Conservative MP told the BBC they were unhappy with the tax rises announced.
""This is fiscal drag, employed to increase tax revenue by stealth,"" he said. ""It's a straightforward Gordon Brown-Tony Blair New Labour trick and it's not the way a Conservative chancellor should be behaving"".
Conservative Welsh Secretary David TC Davies said: ""The difficult and necessary decisions taken today aim to tackle inflation and restore confidence and stability in the UK economy.""

An internal investigation has found no evidence of bullying during a vote on fracking last month, the House of Commons speaker has said. 
Sir Lindsay Hoyle said the atmosphere was ""tense"" but there was no evidence of ""undue influence"" on MPs.
He added that the report about the incident would be published shortly.
urrounding the vote contributed to the swift downfall of Liz Truss, who resigned as prime minister the next day. 
Some MPs had claimed Conservative colleagues were manhandled into backing the government but ministers denied physical force had been used. 
Labour's Chris Bryant said he witnessed ""clear bullying"" in the division lobby of the House of Commons during the vote on 19 October and that one Tory MP, Alexander Stafford, was ""physically manhandled"". 
But Mr Stafford rejected the claims, saying he had a ""frank and robust conversation"" with members of the government outside the voting lobbies but ""nothing more"".
Speaking after Mr Hoyle's statement, Mr Bryant told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""I am not challenging the ruling of the speaker but I know what I saw and I am not withdrawing a single word.
""It may be that some people feel that they weren't bullied but I saw intimidatory behaviour.""
Sir Lindsay told MPs: ""The atmosphere was tense and members were raising their voices to make themselves heard, but there is no evidence of any bullying or undue influence placed on other members.
""The crowding made it hard to see what was really taking place. 
""While some members thought that physical contact was being used to force a member into the lobby, the member concerned has said very clearly that this did not happen. Those who had the clearest views of the incident confirmed this."" 
Commons speaker said it was important MPs treat each other ""with respect"" and also chastised politicians who took photos of the incident and posted them on social media, which is against Parliament rules.
Mr Bryant has previously apologised for sharing a photo of the incident, despite knowing he was breaking the rules. 
""I thought sometimes you have to break a rule if you see a greater injustice being done,"" he told the BBC. 
But some Conservative MPs called on Mr Bryant to correct the record. 
Mark Jenkinson told the Commons some of his fellow Tories had been ""harangued and harassed"" by opposition MPs and the media because of the photo shared by Mr Bryant, which he ""attempted to justify to this House with a misleading impression"". 
fracking vote, which was brought by Labour, was won by the government with a majority of 96. However, 31 Tory MPs did not take part, according to a list on Parliament's website. 
re was confusion after Tory MPs were initially told it would be treated as a test of loyalty to the government - a motion of confidence - and if they did not oppose the Labour plan they could get kicked out of the parliamentary party.
But just minutes before the vote, climate minister Graham Stuart told Tory MPs it was not a vote of confidence after all, even though the government later insisted that it had been.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has since restored the ban on shale gas fracking in England, which had been lifted by Liz Truss.
Fracking, which involves drilling into the earth to recover gas from shale rock, is opposed by environmental groups, opposition parties and many Conservative MPs because of concerns about earth tremors. 
Ms Truss's decision to lift the ban had provoked a strong backlash from some Tories, who said their constituents did not want fracking in their area. "	/news/uk-politics-63473032

A spokesman for the prime minister said it would enable the government to get through a ""packed"" agenda.

government's current legislative agenda, announced at the start of the current parliamentary session in May, included a bumper 38 laws that Mr Johnson intended to pass before spring next year.
But parliamentary time to get through the measures has been eroded due to leadership changes in the Conservative Party.
Mr Johnson was replaced by Liz Truss in September after a summer leadership race, before she was then replaced by Mr Sunak after 45 days.
Mr Sunak took power after a truncated four-day leadership race in October, without announcing any policies or giving any interviews.
He has since distanced himself from some of the pledges he made during his unsuccessful campaign to replace Mr Johnson over the summer.
Last month, his spokesman said he would be taking time to review ""what is deliverable and what is possible"" from what he promised to do.
Analysis by David Wallace Lockhart, BBC political correspondent 
What's the logic behind stretching out the parliamentary term?
Well, there have been a few distractions in recent months - not least the resignation of two prime ministers.
While this may have provided unprecedented levels of drama, it hasn't been conducive to getting bills through. 
Bills would normally complete all their stages in a single parliamentary session, so the extra time provides a bit more leeway. 
It's also worth remembering a general election has to be held in January 2025 at the very latest. 
A parliamentary session starting next autumn would be expected to end in autumn 2024. That may well prove a logical point to go to the polls.
rolong the current parliamentary session will now give ministers longer to pass laws making their way through Parliament.
udes the Online Safety Bill, a complex law on internet regulation whose passage through the Commons was delayed earlier this month due to the government's decision to make changes to the bill.
It will now go through its final stages in the House of Commons early next year, before it begins its passage through the House of Lords.
It was thought peers would require several weeks to scrutinise the bill, setting up a race to get it through before the session was due to end in the spring.
government would have been unable to ""carry over"" the bill in its current form into the next session, because it had already done this once before from a previous session of Parliament.
Mr Sunak has also faced some difficulties piloting the Levelling Up Bill through Parliament. Its passage was delayed last month after Tory rebels threatened to rebel over housing targets and onshore wind farms.
After the government offered concessions on these two issues earlier this month, however, it made its way through the Commons earlier this week. It is now expected to go to the Lords in the new year. "	/news/uk-politics-63988847
politics	Welsh secretary admits £100 off-grid help is not generous	"Welsh secretary has admitted that the help offered to homes who use off-grid energy is ""not generous"".
Oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are not covered by the energy price cap.
UK government said off-grid households will get an extra £100 on top of a £400 payment going to everyone.
David TC Davies said he was ""sure"" the UK government would be looking at the issue.
He made the comments at his first appearance at the Welsh Affairs Select Committee since Rishi Sunak made him Welsh secretary.
Mr Davies said he had also made ""known"" in government his concerns about jobs at Newport Wafer Fab, which is the subject of a delayed review of its Chinese-ownership.
He said the new prime minister intends to have a ""good and positive"" relationship with the Welsh government.
Conservative MPs are among those who have raised concerns about the support made available to households who use oil or LPG.
Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake has said the £100 would ""leave many struggling to make ends meet"".
revious business secretary, Jacob Rees Mogg, had defended the payment, saying there was ""equivalence"" in the level of support offered because the price of heating oil had not risen as much as the price of gas.
Asked about the issue by Delyn MP Rob Roberts, Mr Davies told the committee: ""I think £100 was certainly not generous, given the circumstances.
""I accept the argument that, in general, those who are on network gas will have seen much steeper rises in percentage terms than those who are off grid but, nonetheless, everyone has seen huge rises in costs.
""I don't feel the £100 was overly generous. I'm sure that's another factor the government will be looking at.""
He suggested he would bring the matter up with UK government colleagues: ""I will make a representation about that, given the percentage size in Wales of people who are off grid.""
Committee chairman and Conservative MP Stephen Crabb asked Mr Davies why the review into Newport Wafer Fab's purchase by Chinese-owned Nexperia had been delayed.
urchase of Britain's largest chip plant was called in for a national security assessment on 25 May by Kwasi Kwarteng, when he was business secretary.
Mr Davies said there was a ""national security issue here"", saying the type of material the plant produces is ""vitally important from a strategic perspective"". 
""The advice I've had is not to comment further on it, but to say that it has been very carefully looked at at the moment by government.""
""I know there are 200 jobs at risk,"" he said, adding he shared concerns about their future prospects: ""I've made that known"".
wide-ranging evidence session touched on warnings from council chief Andrew Morgan that councils could have to make huge cuts without more government funding.
Councils get most of their funding from the Welsh government, which in turn receives most of it from the UK government. 
Questioned by Cynon Valley Labour MP Beth Winter, Mr Davies some councils ""have quite significant reserves and this maybe the moment to look at that"".
He said the Welsh government received an increase in funding of £2.5bn and has tax raising powers. ""If they think there is a simple way to better fund local authorities they have the ability to do that themselves.""
Mr Davies said he would be speaking to the First Minister Mark Drakeford on Wednesday.
His appointment follows a difficult period of relations between the Welsh and UK governments. 
During the short tenure of Liz Truss there was no official contact between the prime minister and the Welsh Labour leader.
Mr Davies said Mr Sunak had told him ""it was important that we develop a good and positive relationship with the Welsh government""."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63487039
politics	Teachers' union 'hopeful' of new offer to avert strike	"EIS general secretary said they are hopeful of a new pay offer.
Scotland's largest teaching union is confident a new pay offer will be made to avert a teacher's strike on Thursday but is still preparing to take action that will close most schools.
rs across the country are due to stage a 24-hour walkout after rejecting a 5% pay increase, calling for 10%.
EIS general secretary Andrea Bradley said the union was ""hopeful"" of a new offer and was prepared to negotiate.
""We are ready to consider a new offer as soon as it comes to us,"" she said.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney previously said there was no more money to fund public sector pay rises.
It followed Scotland's largest nursing union voting to go on strike for the first time ever in a dispute over pay.
Further EIS strike dates have been set for 10 January in primary schools and 11 January in secondary schools. The Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA) is also considering taking strike action in the week beginning 5 December.
Ms Bradley told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show she was very hopeful there would be a new offer having been in informal discussions with the Scottish government.
But she said that as things stood, there had not been any new offer since the previous one was rejected in September so the strike would be going ahead as planned.
""As things stand, the EIS continues to plan for a day of national strike action on Thursday which is likely to close almost all schools in Scotland,"" she said.
""We are hopeful however, that over the course of this weekend Scottish government and Cosla colleagues will have been able to have arrived at an agreement around a more substantial offer than the 5% that was rejected in the the middle of September.
""We are ready to consider a new offer as soon as it comes to us at the beginning of the working work.""
Ms Bradley said the union's salaries committee had scheduled a meeting for Tuesday and another meeting of its executive committee planned for Wednesday.
""So we are more than ready to consider any offer that comes forward from the Scottish government and Cosla over the course of the next couple of days,"" she said.
""Of course we are prepared to negotiate. We have been negotiating around this since April.""
She pointed out that when the EIS claim for a 10% increase was lodged, inflation was at 7% but was now at 11.1%.
""So a 10% pay award would be a 1.1% real terms pay cut and that's against the backdrop of teachers salaries being eroded to the tune of 25% since 2008,"" she said.
She told the programme the union would not like to see any cuts to the education budget.
""Should that occur the responsibility for that will very much lie with the Scottish government, not with teachers and not with the EIS who are quite rightly looking to protect the living standards of teachers as hard-working public sector workers,"" she said.
""When you underfund education it is ultimately the children and young people who will be disadvantaged.""
She said that as teachers had not received any pay increase yet they were struggling to meet the cost of food, fuel, energy and housing and some members were now using food banks.
John Swinney announced £615m of spending cuts in his emergency budget review earlier this month.
It came on top of £560m cuts to public services in September.
Ms Bradley said the EIS understood the position the Scottish government was in but said it had known well in advance that there was going to be a substantial teacher pay claim coming this year.
""They knew to expect this and yet they haven't planned adequately for it so the responsibility rests with the Scottish government,"" she said.
Scottish government has said it is  ""committed to supporting a fair pay offer"" through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers - the body that negotiates pay and conditions of service.
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ""We are absolutely committed to supporting a fair pay offer for teachers through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers, the body that negotiates their pay and conditions of service.
""I spoke to trades union representatives on Friday and restated that I am keen to work with Cosla, as the employers, to allow them to make a revised pay offer and avoid unnecessary strikes.
""I have been clear, however, that the Scottish government has a fixed budget and if we are looking to fund public sector pay offers, then that money must come from somewhere else in the budget.""
Scottish Conservatives education spokesman Stephen Kerr said: ""Teachers are clearly sending out a message that the SNP have failed to prepare, and now they are preparing to fail as strikes will shut nearly every school in Scotland on Thursday.
""Our young pupils suffered enough disruption during the pandemic and missing out on more classroom time is the last thing they need. The buck for this imminent strike action stops with the SNP government.
""They claim education is their top priority but have failed to address these threats with any sort of urgency. There is still time for Shirley-Anne Somerville to show some leadership, get back round the table with the unions, and avoid the school gates being closed this week which will cause huge disruption across the country.""
Scottish Liberal Democrats education spokesman Willie Rennie said: ""There is no doubt that these strikes will be hugely disruptive but teachers can only be pushed so far.
""Shirley-Anne Somerville should have been front and centre for months hammering out a deal between educational authorities and teachers. Instead, she hides away in St Andrews House and blames everyone but herself for these strikes.""
""A pay deal needs to be reached in the next few days. If these strikes go ahead she will owe parents, teachers and pupils a public apology.""
EIS said 96% of its members backed a teachers' strike on a 71% turnout.
rospect of the teachers' strike on Thursday will revive memories of the long-running programme of industrial action in the 1980s.
wo main teachers' unions - the EIS and the SSTA - were involved in a pay dispute which lasted for two years and which often seemed like a war of attrition between the unions and the Conservative government of the time. 
Across Scotland, this dispute is often remembered because of the devastating impact a work-to-rule had on school sport. 
But for some young people at the time, the impact was much more severe. As well as a few national strikes, there was a rolling programme of action targeted at secondary schools in the constituencies of government ministers.
regular strikes at schools in some Conservative constituencies had a huge effect on the education of some young people and the school community.
EIS members at some schools went on strike regularly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
It is perhaps impossible to truly quantify the impact of these regular strikes on some students - some may even have failed exams because of lost teaching time.
Each side was acutely aware of the impact the action was having on young people and tended to blame the other for it.
memory of this lengthy dispute - and its impact on some schools and young people - is one reason why many teachers still regard striking as a nuclear option and hope the mere threat of action now will be sufficient. "	/news/uk-scotland-63694057

""I've been informed that Nexperia will now challenge the order and will do everything possible to keep the factory operating and protect its employees in South Wales. They have my support.""
Ms Jones asked Business Secretary Grant Shapps to publicise the security assessment that prompted the decision.
Mr Shapps acknowledged it was a ""concerning time for 500 or so employees"" at Newport Wafer Fab.
But added: ""She is not privy to the information that I have had to weigh up in order to come to this national security decision.
""Nor can I am afraid accede to her request to publish that information.""

Mr Shapps said he heard what she said and was ""very conscious of her comments"".
""The government's involvement is looking at the national security aspects of this but as a government we want to see good employers everywhere"".
Labour Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: ""The chaotic process and the lack of strategy from the government have left workers and businesses facing a great deal of uncertainty,"" saying it took ministers 16 months to make this decision.
Mr Shapps replied that it was a ""rather unfair assessment of what's happened"", saying the relevant legislation ""only came into existence this January, so to say there has been 16 months during which we have not made any decisions is simply untrue""."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63706225

gas fracking in England has been restored by new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in his first PMQs.
His predecessor Liz Truss had lifted the ban on the controversial process where there was local consent.
In his first full day in the job, Mr Sunak also defended reappointing Suella Braverman as home secretary  just days after she quit over data breaches. 
During Prime Minister's Questions he would not commit to increasing benefits in line with prices. 
However, Mr Sunak said he would continue to ""protect the most vulnerable"". 
His spokesman also refused to comment on whether the state pension would rise with inflation ahead of a statement by the chancellor next month. 
Jeremy Hunt is now due to set out the government's plans for tax and spending on 17 November, after delaying the announcement by more than two weeks. 
Ms Truss announced her decision to lift the ban on fracking, which involves drilling into the earth to recover gas from shale rock, in September. With energy bills rising, she argued fracking could boost the UK's gas supplies. 
But the move provoked a backlash from many Conservative MPs because of concerns about earth tremors linked to fracking. 
roversial process was halted in 2019 following opposition from environmental groups and local communities.
Labour and other opposition parties are also against the return of fracking. 
Asked by Green MP Caroline Lucas if he would restore the moratorium on fracking pledged in the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto, Mr Sunak said: ""I have already said I stand by the manifesto on that.""
ries' general election manifesto said the party would not support fracking unless the science showed ""categorically"" that it could be carried out safely. 
PM's official spokesman later confirmed Mr Sunak was committed to this promise.

Rishi Sunak's first PMQs, it felt like the last remaining remnants of her ideas were lobbed in the skip.
So her flirtation with fracking in England is junked, with the PM restoring a 2019 ""moratorium"" on drilling for shale gas.
It was also strongly hinted that the government will raise those benefits that don't automatically go up with prices in line with the rate of inflation.
Liz Truss was tempted to put them up in line with average earnings instead.
So what about pensions? Will they go up in line with spiralling prices too?
rime minister's official spokesman was less categorical about that, but the importance of the manifesto was repeatedly referenced.
Read more from Chris.
Mr Sunak has previously expressed support for fracking. Just a week ago he voted against a Labour motion to ban the practice. 
Asked during a Tory leadership debate with Ms Truss in July whether he would support fracking, he replied: ""Yes, if local communities support it.""
Labour's shadow climate and net zero secretary Ed Miliband said: ""Whatever their latest position, the truth is that the Tories have shown that they cannot be trusted on the issue of fracking. The only way to guarantee that fracking will be banned for good is to elect a Labour government.""
move was welcomed by environmental groups, with Friends of the Earth describing it as a ""fantastic victory for common sense"".
Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, said: ""[Fracking] is unpopular, and few communities would approve fracking projects locally, meaning little or no gas would be extracted, despite the high political cost.
""Instead, the government should focus on building more cheap and popular renewables, including onshore wind and solar where there is local support.""
Chaos surrounding a vote on fracking, brought by Labour last week, contributed to Ms Truss's swift downfall, just 44 days after she took office. 
g before her resignation, there were accusations of Tory MPs being bullied and manhandled during the vote. 
Ministers denied physical force had been used to persuade colleagues to vote with the government. 
government ultimately won the vote with a majority of 96, but 40 Tories did not take part. 
Scottish and Welsh governments continue to oppose fracking, and say they will not use their powers to grant drilling licences.

politics	NI Protocol: Warning over loyalist paramilitaries gaining momentum	"Loyalist paramilitaries cannot be allowed to gain ""a momentum"" from the Northern Ireland Protocol dispute, MPs have been told.
John McBurney was speaking to a Westminster committee, along with other members of the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC).
""There is no doubt groups on the loyalist side see the protocol as an issue that can generate a momentum. 
""And that is a momentum we can well do without,"" Mr McBurney said.
""The way to do without it is by reaching a solution.""
He added ""solving it"" would ""get things back onto an even keel"".
Mr McBurney was responding to a question from DUP MP Carla Lockhart who said ""continued political action is needed on the [protocol] issue"".
Loyalist opposition to the protocol was partly responsible for sporadic street disorder in early 2021.
re was also a series of peaceful protest rallies which ended in the summer.
""It has been encouraging to see a phasing down of protests in the streets in preference to political exchanges and endeavours which are ongoing,"" Mr McBurney said.
""But be in no doubt that things can flare up again if an issue which seems unresolved and unresolvable then becomes such a frustration that it pours out into our streets.
""That cannot be allowed to happen.""
IRC was set up by the British and Irish government to monitor efforts to tackle paramilitarism.
In a report published last week it said such efforts should be re-doubled.
IRC's four commissioners were appearing before the Westminster committee to discuss the idea that a body should be established to talk to paramilitary groups to try to get them to disband.

politics	Northern Ireland Protocol Bill: Lord Clarke says it is poisoning UK-EU relations	"Advancing the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill through Parliament is ""poisoning the whole relationship"" behind UK-EU negotiations, Lord Clarke has said.
He was speaking as the bill moved to its next stage in the House of Lords.
""What would our reaction be if the Europeans came to the table and put a similar blunderbuss in front of us?"" the former chancellor asked on Tuesday.
However the crossbench peer Lord Bew claimed the bill was not a contentious matter in the revived EU-UK talks.
He said the EU had decided that ""this bill is not going to be the thing that stops substantive negotiation"".
Lord Bew, a former adviser to the late Lord Trimble, added that delaying the bill would however damage the government's attempt to get the DUP back into the Northern Ireland Executive.
Former DUP deputy leader Lord Dodds also spoke in favour of the bill, saying that supporting it was not incompatible with seeking a negotiated outcome.
He also suggested the EU had put its own gun on the negotiating table by advancing infringement proceedings against the UK.
Peers are scheduled to spend four days on line-by-line scrutiny of the proposed legislation.
rotocol is the Brexit agreement for Northern Ireland, which was agreed by the UK and EU in 2019.
It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding the need for a hard border with the Irish Republic after Brexit.
However, it also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses.
Unionists also say it is undermining Northern Ireland's place in the UK and is contrary to the spirit of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the peace deal which set up power sharing in Northern Ireland.
If the bill is passed into law it would give the UK government unilateral powers to change the operation and oversight of the protocol.
UK has acknowledged this would breach the terms of the deal but has claimed this can be justified on the grounds of necessity under international law.
re have previously been calls for the bill to be paused to allow time for a negotiated settlement to be reached with the EU.
Relations between the UK and EU appeared to have improved since Boris Johnson left office and both London and Brussels have been talking up the potential for striking a deal through a fresh round of negotiations.
If the bill becomes law, the EU could start fresh infringement proceedings under EU law or trigger the dispute resolution mechanism under the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is refusing to return to power sharing at Stormont due to its opposition to the protocol.
A six-month legislative deadline to form an power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland expires on Friday, 28 October. 
If no executive is in place by that date, the UK government has a legal responsibility to call another election.
EU has proposed ways of easing the impacts of the protocol but the UK says these measures do not go far enough.
UK government presented the protocol bill to the House of Commons in June and it was passed without amendment by the end of July.
It is expected to face a more difficult time in the Lords.
Peers have submitted more than 20 pages of amendments, including a Labour amendment which would require the government to ""exhaust legal routes under the EU withdrawal agreement"" before availing itself of the powers in the bill."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63379463
politics	St David's Hall: Cardiff plan 'may see millions invested'	"A plan for a company to take over management of Cardiff concert venue St David's Hall would ""safeguard"" its future, the city council has claimed.
uthority argued that giving the lease to Academy Music Group (AMG) would mean millions of pounds worth of repairs could be done to the building.
An extraordinary full council meeting will be held on Friday to discuss it.
But staff are among those opposing the plan, and a petition is urging the Welsh government to buy the hall. 
It could then, according to the petition, be kept ""as a national resource for Wales"".
AMG, which owns a number of UK venues, and works in partnership with 02 academies and music promoter Live Nation, has offered to take over the hall on a long-term lease.
uncil said the deal would mean ""much-needed"" repairs and refurbishment would be carried out, which could save taxpayers ""millions"".
It also said it would mean a ""revitalised"" events programme designed to safeguard the classical music repertoire, and bring ""celebrated rock and pop artists"" to the city.
uthority said ""significant sums"" were needed to fully upgrade the hall, but it would ""struggle"" to find the money, with an existing ""£53m hole"" in the next financial year's budget.
Cabinet member for culture, parks and events Jennifer Burke Davies said it ""might be one of the few opportunities we have to safeguard the future of St David's Hall for years to come"".
Last week hall staff voiced concern at ""the speed at which this momentous decision is taking place and the lack of consultation or information about the new arrangements"".
In a statement, the hall staff said they understood pressures on the council, but urged it to slow the process down, be transparent about it and allow time for ""genuine"" consultation.

politics	Brexit added £210 to household food bills, LSE says	"Brexit added £210 to the average household food bill in the two years to the end of 2021, new research suggests.
Academics at the London School of Economics (LSE) found that the cost of food imported from Europe went up because of extra red tape and checks.
rule changes for items going across the border had pushed food prices up by 6%, or £5.84bn overall.
A government spokesperson said that it was cutting costs and reducing red tape for firms.
research noted that UK food producers had faced reduced competition since Brexit.
Researchers at the LSE's Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) looked at data tracking the flow of trade and prices of food products between the UK and the European Union (EU) to work out how shoppers were being affected by the UK's exit.
It also found that price rises hit poorest households hardest because they spend more of their pay packets on food.
How is the rising cost of living affecting you? What questions do you have about the increase in food prices? Get in touch.
r calculations sought to isolate the effects of Brexit and separate them out from other supply chain issues that caused disruption during the pandemic.
research found the increase in food prices was due to a rise in ""non-tariff barriers"" to trade between the UK and the EU, which included things like new customs checks at the borders, new paperwork requirements and broader measures affecting the movement of animals and plants.
Although the extra checks didn't come into force until 2021, one of the co-authors of the research, Nikhil Datta, said it was likely firms made ""anticipatory"" changes around the ""hard Brexit"" pursued by former prime minister, Boris Johnson.
Mr Datta added that these non-tariff barriers should be a ""first-order concern"" for politicians and policymakers.
r also looked at the cost of setting up for new systems, such as hiring specialist staff to be able to manage the trade in products that are subject to more checks.
CEP suggested that between 50% and 88% of price rises seen by these EU exporters and UK importers were being passed on to customers.
Inflation, which tracks how prices rise over time, has hit its highest rate in 40 years.
Richard Davies, a professor at the University of Bristol and co-author of the study, said: ""Many factors, affecting both supply and demand for goods and services, are involved. One factor in this high inflation has been the rise in non-tariff barriers for trade with the EU.
""In leaving the EU, the UK swapped a deep trade relationship with few impediments to trade for one where a wide range of checks, forms and steps are required before goods can cross the border,"" he added.
report said that immediately after the December 2019 general election, food prices from the EU spiked as businesses reliant on products and ingredients from the bloc started to pass costs on.
rice rises varied according to the type of product, but was generally higher for those products like meat with lots of extra paperwork and checks required, whereas those for vegetables like onions, carrots and broccoli, which might also depend on seasonal availability, was lower.
report said overall that less well-off households had seen bigger price rises as a result, due to the fact they spend a higher proportion of their income.
It suggested that one benefit seen from Brexit was that food producers in the UK now faced less competition from farmers and producers in Europe.
But it added that overall the gain seen was outstripped by the losses seen by shoppers by more than £1bn.
A spokesman for the Department for International Trade said: ""We recognise that people are struggling with rising prices due to global inflationary pressures here in the UK, EU and across the world.""
He added that the government is ""protecting millions of the most vulnerable families"" through the energy price guarantee aimed at keeping bills down, as well as specific support for lower-income and pensioner households.
""Our trade agreement with the EU is the world's largest zero-tariff, zero-quota deal, and by also removing tariffs on £30bn of goods, we are cutting costs and reducing red tape,"" he added."	/news/business-63821133

Scottish government figures show £251,728.69 was spent on the court case.

Scottish government said the Supreme Court case had achieved its aim of bringing legal clarity on the issue of legal powers to hold a referendum.
But critics claim it was a waste of money. 
Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Donald Cameron said: ""Taxpayers will be appalled that this significant sum of their money has been frittered away by the SNP.
""The fact legal experts said they were destined to lose makes it all the worse.
""It is a disgraceful waste of public money at a time when Scots are grappling with the cost-of-living crisis and our NHS is totally overwhelmed.""
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had set out plans to hold a referendum on 19 October next year.
gal right to do this was tested by the Supreme Court and it ruled unanimously that she does not have the power to do so because the issue is reserved to Westminster.

It is the lowest amount they have received since mid-2020 and comes after months of turmoil in the party.
Labour raised similar amounts in the same time period, receiving £2.8m including £1.6m from trade unions.
union Unite gave over £700,000 to the party, despite previous threats to review the funding.
Donations to the Liberal Democrats hit £1.4m, while the SNP did not register any donations. 
Responding to the figures, a Conservative Party source said the numbers covered the six-week leadership election when donors gave money to leadership campaigns.

During that time, Boris Johnson resigned as prime minister following scandals over Covid rule-breaking and the appointment of Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip.
Liz Truss was elected to replace Mr Johnson but was forced to step down weeks later when her economic plans triggered market turmoil.
urbulence appears to have damaged Conservative donations which fell from £4.8m in the second quarter of 2022 to £2.9m in the last three months. 
Businessman Gareth Quarry is one donor who has switched his backing, giving Labour £50,000 - in 2016-17 he donated the same amount to the Conservatives.
A Labour spokesperson said: ""Donors are coming back to Labour because they can see we are a changed party that is serious about getting into government and building a fairer, greener, more dynamic Britain.""
Over half of the party's donations came from unions, with Unison giving £196,000 and Unite donating £728,000. 
Earlier this year Unite, Labour's biggest donor, said financial support for the party was under review.
It followed a bitter row between the unions and the Labour-run council in Coventry over a pay dispute for bin lorry drivers in the city.

He claimed this would help tame soaring inflation. 
Labour said the measures were a result of ""the economic carnage"" created by previous Prime Minister Liz Truss.
government's forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility, have said the UK is facing the biggest drop in living standards since record began as a result of rising prices. 
flation was expected to be 9.1% in 2022, dropping to 7.4% next year.

politics	Poverty: Single major challenge facing Wales - warning	"Poverty in Wales is the ""single major challenge"", an official report has warned.
Figures suggest more than a third of children in Wales are now classed as living in poverty, more than anywhere else in the UK.
Audit Office has called for renewed focus across every tier of government in Wales to address the issue.
It includes a key recommendation for new a national strategy and targets to tackle poverty.
50-page investigation by the auditor general for Wales said it recognised that dealing with poverty remains a priority for Welsh government and local councils.
However, it stated that a mix of approaches and ""complicated"" working environments meant ""ambitions, focus, actions and prioritisation vary widely"".
Audit Office said the current cost of living crisis was making the situation even worse.
If things feel bad now, there's worse to come, warns the man behind a social enterprise partnership aimed at feeding those struggling to pay for food.
Robbie Davison said spiralling food costs were eye-watering, and ""hard working people"" were struggling.
He set up Well-Fed in Flintshire, alongside the council and ClwydAlyn Housing Association, with a mission to ""feed hungry people fresh meals, free of charge"".
He said there had been a shocking rise in requests for help from Well-Fed, with families ""on the edge"" financially now unable to cope.
He warned that as winter approached, there would be a further crisis.
""The services who deal with this are not ready to deal with the demand. The moment it starts to get cold, people will start to slip.""
He is also critical of the universal help from the UK government on energy bills.
""It doesn't matter if you've got heating, if you've got no food - you are never going to get warm,"" he said.
""If you've got a good meal inside you - you can at least start to cope.""
According to the report, 34% of children in Wales were predicted to be living in poverty in March 2021.
It means that 34% of children in Wales are living in a home where the income available to that household is less than 60% of the UK average - which is how relative income poverty is defined by officials in Wales.
falling into ""in-work poverty"" - where working families no longer have enough income to meet household bills - rose by 18% in Wales in 2021.
report said the UK government's Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts suggest household incomes across the UK will fall in 2022-23 ""by the largest amount since records began in the mid-1950s"" when inflation is taken into account.
In Wales, the Audit Office said greater numbers of people are now experiencing energy and food insecurity, adding: ""The poorer you are, the greater the impact of the cost-of-living crisis is having on you.""
Auditor General for Wales Adrian Crompton said the report was a chance to offer ""some reflections"" on the issues for those in charge across the country;
""For the Welsh government, I would certainly not question the sincerity of their commitment, not that of local authorities around the country, but there are things we can do to improve the way we address the issue,"" he said.
Audit Office estimated that a wide range of Welsh government projects supporting people in poverty was collectively worth about £1bn in 2021-22.
But it also stressed that the total level of spending by both Welsh government and local councils ""is unknown"".
It has also flagged that a target to eradicate child poverty in Wales by 2020 was dropped in the last Senedd term, and made one of its key recommendations a need for a ""revised national strategy"" on child poverty.
In addition to calls for a revised national strategy on tackling poverty, it has also called for:
However, the Audit Office report also recognised that neither the Welsh government nor local authorities were able to change several key factors outside of their control.
Issues such as welfare benefits, taxation, social security payments, employment law and minimum wages were all powers held by the UK government.
report noted that the Welsh and UK governments often had ""divergent views on the role of the state in tackling and alleviating poverty"". 
Responding to the report, the Welsh government said it will carefully consider the findings.
""We are doing everything we can to tackle poverty and help people through the very difficult cost of living crisis by providing targeted support to those who need it most and through universal programmes which put money back in people's pockets,"" said a Welsh government official.
""However, we won't be able to protect everyone given the size and scale of the financial problems caused by the UK government's mishandling of the public finances.""
A spokesperson for the Welsh Local Government Association, which represents local authorities in Wales, said: ""We welcome the acknowledgment of the good work done by councils to get to grips with poverty in our communities.  
""However, councils face an £802m budget black hole over the next two years. Left unfunded, such a shortfall could have disastrous implications for vital community services such as social care, housing, and schools.
""We urge the UK government to confirm funding for Wales, to enable Welsh Government to invest in these vital services.""
A UK government spokesperson said: ""Latest figures show there were two million fewer people in absolute poverty compared with ten years ago, including 500,000 fewer children. 
""However we know households are worried about rising costs, which is why we are protecting the most vulnerable families in Wales with at least £1,200 of direct payments.

politics	The local battles behind Tory housing divisions	"""We don't have enough new, purpose-built homes for people in my situation""
government has agreed to water down housing targets for local councils in the face of a rebellion from nearly 60 of its own MPs. But not everyone is happy - some Tories are worried this could lead to fewer homes being built and make it even harder for people to get on the housing ladder. At a local level, new developments provoke passionate views on both sides. 
""Unless I'm prepared to move 100 miles north of here then it's really unlikely I'll be able to get on the housing ladder,"" says Sheldon Allen. 
21-year-old, who is president of Reading University's Students' Union and a Labour activist, is currently renting a room in the town centre for £625 a month.
With bills to pay on top of that he says ""it's a real struggle to make ends meet"".
Sheldon thinks building more homes would help bring down the cost of renting and buying. 
""Ultimately I don't think we have enough new, purpose-built homes for people in my situation and others like me,"" he says.
But in the nearby borough of Wokingham in Berkshire, some locals are angry about the idea of more homes being built in the area. 
""I'm not against houses per se. We've had a lot of housing development in this area,"" says Paul Stevens. ""We feel we've done our bit.""
Paul started a campaign group against plans to build up to 4,500 new homes on an area of land just south of Reading. 
group argues the area lacks the infrastructure needed for a major housing development and risks causing flooding and traffic problems. 
""We're potentially tearing up valuable farmland and growth space to fill it with concrete,"" says Andy Bailey, another member of the group. ""It's sacrilege - this should simply not be happening.""
Local campaigners on housebuilding plans: ""It's sacrilege - this should simply not be happening""
University of Reading, which is one of the owners of the land, says: ""We believe we've put forward a good plan that would provide homes, community facilities, and jobs in creative, heritage and high-tech sectors.""
However, a spokesman adds: ""We recognise this is a difficult balancing act, and we welcome discussion about what's best for everyone.""
A spokeswoman for Wokingham Borough Council says draft development plans were prepared by the previous Conservative administration and the council is gathering evidence before setting out the next stages, with no decisions made yet.
Paul does not dispute that there needs to be more affordable housing for young people but says the homes being built in the area are too expensive to solve the problem. 
""My son couldn't afford to live around here. He couldn't afford to buy anywhere,"" he says. 
""These houses are not being built for young people, they're being built for old people who are escaping London.""
Wokingham's Conservative MP John Redwood was among nearly 60 Tories backing a plan to ban mandatory housebuilding targets in England. 
rebels say targets are undermining local decision-making and mean homes aren't built in the right places.
Housing Secretary Michael Gove has now offered councils more flexibility over meeting the government-set targets to ""reflect local circumstances"". 
He told MPs the targets should be ""an advisory starting point"" rather than mandatory. 
rebels have welcomed the change in position, with Mr Redwood saying it will give councils and local communities a role in deciding what is ""sustainable and appropriate"". 
But other Tories have argued weakening targets would mean fewer houses are built, which they say would be politically damaging for the party. 
government says it's still committed to the national target, set out in the 2019 Conservative manifesto, to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s. 
However, it's on track to miss that target, with the figure remaining below 250,000 in recent years. 
Clive Jones, the Liberal Democrat leader of Wokingham Borough Council, says he is ""cautiously optimistic"" above the government's agreement with the rebels but ""the devil is always in the detail"". 
He is hopeful the change will mean local people can decide the level of housing they want in their area. 
Under the current government-calculated targets, Wokingham needs to build around 800 new homes a year up to 2036. 
Mr Jones says this is too many. 
""We have provided 40,000 new homes in the last 40 years and most people will say that is too much. Enough is enough,"" he says. 
""A lot of people have moved here in the last 40 years. They moved here because they like to be in a semi-rural area because that is what Wokingham is.
""It's changing and it's changing too fast for lots of people. It's becoming like a suburb of south London… and that is not what people want.""
Conservatives lost control of the council in May after two decades in charge - although they remain the largest party. 
Lib Dems now run the council in coalition with Labour and Independent councillors. 
Mr Jones says overdevelopment was one of the big issues which contributed to May's local election result. 
He is standing as the Lib Dem candidate for Wokingham in the next general election, which is due in two years' time. 
Mr Jones believes if the current level of development in Wokingham continues it will be a close fight between the Lib Dems and Conservatives, who currently hold the seat with a majority of 7,383. 
""It won't just be housing - it will be the cost-of living-crisis, it will be the crisis in social care,"" he says.
""All of those things coming together are going to make it very difficult for the Conservatives to hold on to this part of Berkshire.""
Even if local targets are made more flexible, Mr Jones says it won't affect developments which have already been approved. 
""[The Conservatives] have forced all of this housing on us over the past 10 years. We have got loads of outstanding planning permissions which will then be built out so there isn't going to suddenly be no more building here.""

for filling in the form had to be extended, and still failed to reach the target 90% of households.
An Audit Scotland report said this resulted in increased costs and extra work.
National Records of Scotland (NRS) delayed the census because of Covid-19 restrictions.
In the other UK nations, where it was not delayed, the survey reached 97% coverage. 
Only 89% of homes in Scotland returned the survey - this figure was 79% before the deadline was extended.
A subsequent survey by the NRS to assess the gaps left by the low response, also fell short of its target reach. 
Edinburgh University's Prof Lindsay Paterson, an expert in data-led social research, said it was not far-fetched to call it a ""fiasco"", calling it ""an extreme embarrassment"".
However, Audit Scotland's report noted that the NRS issued up to five further reminder letters and post cards, along with increased media and marketing activity. 
It said other countries also extended their deadlines in recent years due to Covid restrictions limiting door to door activity - including the USA. 
report also said people who had not completed the form were given a chance to comment on their reasons.
Of the 1,231 responses, it said the most common reasons were that people were ""too busy"" (35%), ""not aware of the census"" (16%) or did not realise they had to complete it (14%).
An independent group of census and data experts was established in response to the low turnout in Scotland.
It concluded the NRS had a ""solid foundation"" to continue the next phase of the census.
Auditor General Stephen Boyle noted the £6m additional cost of the census, saying its data is vital to planning public services.
He said: ""It's important that National Records of Scotland establishes why the return rate was significantly lower than the other countries in the UK. 
""Those lessons should be shared and will be crucial to planning for future censuses and surveys."" 
Scottish Conservative's constitution spokesperson Donald Cameron said: ""It was clear from the moment that the Scottish government decided to hold their census on a different date from the rest of the UK that it would cause trouble.

politics	Families demand justice over police killings	"Families of people killed by police are calling for an urgent meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, to demand justice for their loved ones.
In a letter to the PM, the families of Chris Kaba and Oladeji Omishore, who died after a confrontation with the police, demand that the officers involved in their death be charged.
families also want meetings with London mayor Sadiq Khan, and Home Secretary Suella Braverman.
government has yet to respond,
Mr Kaba, 24, was shot following a car pursuit that ended in Streatham on the night of 5 September.
Metropolitan Police has suspended the officer who shot Mr Kaba, but the family has criticised the length of time it took for this to happen, accusing the force of racism. 
Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) are still investigating Mr Kaba's death.
Mr Omishore, 41, died after being pulled from the River Thames having been tasered by officers.

""We demand an end to state killings, and the systematic patterns and failures within the judicial process that follow the death of a loved one caused or contributed to by agents of the state,"" it says.
""As prime minister, you and your government are ultimately accountable for these deaths.""
r is written by the The United Families & Friends Campaign (UFFC), which is a national coalition of those affected by deaths in police, prison and psychiatric custody. 
group was initially a network of black families but over recent years it has expanded and now includes the families and friends of people from varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds.
UFFC is calling for officers involved in custody deaths to be suspended until investigations are completed and prosecutions should automatically follow ""unlawful killing"" verdicts. 
In a statement released in June, Mr Omishore's family expressed concerns about how police had handled the situation when he was ""clearly suffering from a mental health crisis and he was vulnerable and frightened"".
IOPC has previously confirmed that Mr Omishore had been tasered more than once - but said there is so far no indication the officers involved had breached police professional standards or committed a criminal offence.

politics	From where does the government borrow billions?	"UK government faces a gap between how much it raises in taxes and what it plans to spend. 
ridge this gap it needs to borrow money.
government gets most of its income from taxes - for example, workers pay income tax, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on their profits.
It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes - and in some years that happens.
But if it cannot do that, it needs to either raise taxes or cut spending, both of which are generally unpopular. 
Higher taxes also mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean they pay less tax too.
So governments often choose to borrow to boost the economy if it looks like it might be at risk of slowing down. 
Governments also borrow to fund major long-term projects such as new railways and roads, which it also hopes will help the economy to grow.
government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.
A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments in the meantime.
UK government bonds - known as ""gilts"" - are normally seen as very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.
Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. 
Bank of England has also bought trillions of pounds' worth of government bonds in the past to support the economy, through a process called ""quantitative easing"".
For example, in response to the financial turmoil caused by the government's mini-budget in September, the Bank bought gilts at an ""urgent pace"" to help restore what it called ""orderly market conditions"".
However, since then it has resumed its previous plan to sell off some of the bonds it holds. 
Yes - though opinions differ about how much.
In November 2022, the government borrowed £22bn, £13.9bn more than in November 2021.
However, figures for the financial year to date show that - in the eight months to November - the government borrowed £105.4bn - £7bn less than in the same period of 2021.
mount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently £2.47 trillion. 
rly as much as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as GDP. 
Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost.  
Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax revenue in the long run.
However, the larger the national debt gets, the more interest the government has to pay on the money it has borrowed. 
rest on government debt in November 2022 rose to £7.3bn, the highest figure since 1997.
""Since mid-2021, the cost of servicing central government debt has increased considerably,"" the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
government is expected to spend more than £100bn in 2022 and 2023 on debt interest - more than it spends on education. 
Any money borrowed now has to be paid back one day. 
will mean that in the future there will be higher taxes and/or less money available to pay for public services.
What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy?
Governments often increase borrowing when they face unusually difficult situations, such as the coronavirus pandemic, or the current cost-of-living crisis. 
fund extra government spending, such as helping with higher energy bills or paying some of the wages of people who could not work during Covid. 
But most economists and politicians agree that debt cannot keep growing for ever, because at some point it will become impossible to keep paying the interest.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has blamed the ""twin global emergencies of a pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine"" for driving up the government's costs.
He has said that he plans to get debt falling relative to the size of the economy ""over the medium term"". 
ficit is the amount by which the government's income falls short of what it spends.
Borrowing covers most of this gap, or sometimes it sells assets such as property. 
In years when a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus. 
Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. 
It rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.  "	/news/business-50504151

politics	Rishi Sunak sets out China policy as Tory critics loom	"China is a growing superpower, with a wildly different worldview and totally different set of values to the UK. 
So how should the government manage its relationship with Beijing?
In Rishi Sunak's first major speech on foreign policy as prime minister, he said his approach would not be one of ""grand rhetoric"" - which sounds just a little bit like a gentle pop at one Boris Johnson - but ""robust pragmatism"".
What on earth does that mean?
Mr Sunak acknowledged that ""China is conspicuously competing for global influence using all the levers of state power"".
He also said it was ""naïve"" to think ""trade would lead to social and political reform"".
king of gentle pops, without referring to anyone in particular, you might remember seven years ago, and four prime ministers ago, David Cameron took President Xi of China for a pint at a pub in Buckinghamshire. 
rgument then was that the best way to engage with China, both economically and diplomatically, was to extend trading relationships. 
-chancellor, George Osborne, even said London's relationship with Beijing was entering a ""golden era"" - something Mr Sunak said directly and definitively was ""over"".
But he still wants to warm the relationship up, compared to where it's been in the meantime.
When Mr Sunak's team briefed us reporters at the G20 summit in Indonesia ahead of a planned meeting with President Xi, we were reminded that it had been over 18 months since a British prime minister had even spoken on the phone to the Chinese president.
And you have to go back to Theresa May's time in Downing Street for the last face-to-face meeting, when she travelled to Beijing early in 2018.
David Cameron took China's President Xi Jinping for a pint in his local pub
As it happens, the formal meeting in Bali between Mr Sunak and President Xi got cancelled because both leaders' diaries were upended by the missile that landed in Poland, killing two people and briefly sparking concern of a confrontation between NATO and Russia. 
Instead, the two leaders managed a quick hello but nothing more - but a proper meeting was very much what the prime minister wanted.
Rishi Sunak's argument is the UK ""simply cannot ignore China's significance in world affairs,"" as it extends to economic stability, climate change and food security. 
In short, he says, these issues can't be substantively addressed unless there is a relationship with Beijing.
Labour describe this ebb and flow of the instincts of various recent prime ministers as the government ""flip-flopping its rhetoric on China.""
But what might this new relationship actually look like? Or, to get back to where we started, what does ""robust pragmatism"" actually mean?
His critics are quick to offer a view.
One of his predecessors as Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, is blunt.
Sir Iain is one of a handful of parliamentarians banned from China after criticising its treatment of the Uighurs. 
Writing in the Daily Express, his critique of the Prime Minister's approach could hardly be more blunt. ""I wonder if robust pragmatism now sounds more and more like appeasement,"" he wrote.
In short, he thinks Rishi Sunak has gone soft on the issue.
ruth is, right now, we don't know in practical terms what this new approach will actually amount to.
Mr Sunak is promising more detail in what is known as the Integrated Review - which will set out the UK's national security and foreign policy - in the new year.
But we know already how China is now described: a ""systemic challenge"".
government hopes that people will understand that international relations, like any human relations, are complex and nuanced; that a binary approach, as they see it, would not be in the UK's interests.
But for the prime minister's critics, failing to describe Beijing as a ""threat"" is a big mistake."	/news/uk-politics-63789175
politics	Norwich North MP Chloe Smith to stand down at next election	"Conservative MP for Norwich North, Chloe Smith, is to stand down at the next general election.
former work and pensions secretary served in the cabinet role during Liz Truss's brief tenure in No 10 and has held the Norwich North seat since 2009.
Among her ministerial posts, Ms Smith also served in the Treasury and Northern Ireland Office.
Ms Smith was 27 years old when she was first elected and was the youngest MP in the House of Commons at the time.
She has contested and retained the marginal seat in five elections.
Ms Smith said she was most proud of founding the Norwich for Jobs project, helping thousands of young people into work in the city.
""I have been honoured to be Norwich North's MP,"" she said.
""It's a fantastic job for a fantastic place, and it's a particular privilege to be able to represent Norwich and Norfolk, where I come from.
""I am grateful to the thousands of Norwich citizens who placed their trust in me so many times.""
Ms Smith did not given a reason for her departure, but thanked her team for supporting her during ""tough personal times"". 
""In 2024, after 15 years of service, it will be the right time to step back, for me and my young family,"" she said.
MP was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020 and announced she was clear of the disease in 2021. 
Ms Smith has consistently won the seat in general elections with a majority of about 4,000 - except for in 2017, when this dropped to 507.
From 1997 until 2009 the constituency was held by Labour's Ian Gibson. 
Conservative MPs are starting to think about the future. 
xt election is probably two years off, but it could take place as soon as next year. 
All of the parties are going on to an election footing and the Conservative central office wrote to all its MPs this weekend, asking them if they planned to stand again. Ms Smith has always had one of the most marginal seats in the East of England and she's always fought a strong battle to hold on. 
w boundary changes would have made things a little easier for her and she had been telling friends that she was up for the fight. 
But after almost 15 years in Parliament and with the opinion polls suggesting that the next election will be a very tough fight, her party could end up in opposition and she seems to have concluded that it is time to move on.
I suspect she won't be the last. I am aware of at least four other Conservative MPs in the East who are having similar discussions.
uld be a sign that, once again, the political winds are starting to change.
In her statement she said she was proud to have worked cross-party, particularly putting the British Sign Language Act into law with Rosie Cooper MP. She said this was significant because of a deaf family member. 
Ms Smith was also involved in lobbying for new carriages on the Norwich-London train line and co-chaired the Great Eastern Mainline Taskforce.
Conservative Party said the process to select its next candidate would take place ""in the coming months"".

politics	What's eating the Tories?	"Soon to have their fifth leader and prime minister in six years, there's something about the Conservative Party that is malfunctioning so badly that it could self-destruct.
re could be many reasons, according to your taste. But here are three. There's a problem in the selection process that has led to people rising to the top before it's clear they are capable of leading people, of leading thought, of governing, and of holding the party together.
In a parliamentary system, it used to be that you only got to lead a major party after years of learning and honing the many skills required, while proving your ability and fitness for the job to those around you. Not any more. 
One theory of leadership and power is that the people who most crave it are often the people who should not be allowed to achieve it. It's a theory with which the Conservative electorate may be unfamiliar.
Second, holding the parliamentary party together has become more difficult.
Factions have developed, over Europe of course, but also to fight culture wars, to rein back on climate change measures, to represent the working class interests of new, north of England MPs, while ex-ministers exiled from office by incoming prime ministers have questioned why they should stay loyal.
It is less united in the background and outlook of its MPs. A culture of deference and discipline has been weakened by decades of rebellion over Europe. That's no bad thing, you might think. The point is that it makes leadership more difficult.
rd, this is not just about competing egos. It's about competing visions of where Tories want to take the country and the economy.
was a party that has not grown up around any philosophical base. You could argue that it was based on, if anything, an English or perhaps a British tendency to be wary of ideologies. 
Conservatives have been successful as an election-winning machine for nearly two centuries by being pragmatic - by reading the electorate and by doing what it takes to win and hold power.
But it has had a sort of ideology bolted on to it. A strand of British nationalism and exceptionalism has become more prominent, and it has bound the party inextricably with Brexit.
r Britain's relations with Europe were important to the removal of Margaret Thatcher. John Major's administration was run ragged by what he termed Euro-sceptic ""bastards"".
From 13 years of opposition, David Cameron emerged with a message that the party had to be about more than Europe.
't last long. In office, he was forced to promise a referendum if he got a majority. He under-estimated the ability of his own party colleagues to mobilise the ""Leave"" vote, losing him that vote and costing him his job.
xt three leaders sought to ""Get Brexit Done"", as Boris Johnson summarised it in the 2019 election slogan. In doing so, he expelled party members who continued to fight for a less hardline Brexit deal than the one Theresa May and Johnson favoured.
By removing that centre right Remainer tendency, it should have made it easier for Liz Truss to unite the party around a clear vision of where Brexit is taking the UK.
Yet it was on those issues that she faltered. The spectacularly botched mini-budget reflected a belief that ""Taking Back Control"" meant the occupants of Downing Street, having secured control of Parliament, were free to do as they wished.
fall-out from that tax-cutting splurge showed that the bond markets and other institutions, including the Bank of England and Office for Budget Responsibility, put constraints on the freedom of manoeuvre even of a post-Brexit prime minister. The ""control"" they took back from Brussels was not as unconstrained as they had thought.
And that was before Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng had the opportunity to engage with the inevitable resistance to the ""supply-side"" changes they wanted to make, in de-regulating planning, fracking, employment and environmental rules.
As the party of Brexit, the results of leaving the single market and customs union are now challenging Conservatives to define where that decision is to take them and the nation.
mpact on the economy from the point of disengagement at the start of 2021 has not been clear because of so many other factors around the pandemic.
But we are now seeing a clearer picture emerge of how much less trade Britain does with the European Union, and it has been illuminated in a new report from the Economic and Social Research Institute.
Economists there compared Britain's trade performance with other countries as global trade recovered from the worst of the pandemic. Even though there are fewer constraints on goods traffic from the EU to the UK, because Britain has declined to impose the checks it agreed it would, economists found that has fallen by 20%.
Goods traffic from the UK to EU has held up better. There are checks, paperwork and delays for trucks crossing the North Sea and Channel, but that is still 16% below where these economists think British trade would be if Brexit had not changed its relations with the EU.
Ireland has a different story of increased trade; much less going from Britain across the Irish Sea, but more going the other way, or into Northern Ireland, on a border where there are no barriers to trade.
Where, then, does the UK government go to show that Brexit can and will work? To trade deals with other countries, beyond Europe, which we are told have faster-growing economies and will want to improve trade with the UK. These are taking a longer time to secure than Brexiteers had expected.
gned off with New Zealand and Australia have met resistance in the UK, for the impact they will probably have on farming, with only modest gains in removing export barriers.
A limited deal with India was aimed at sign-off around Diwali - this coming Monday - but that deadline will be missed, and expectations are being lowered. Even if the strategy is successful, these will take years to offset the fall in EU trade.
So the new mantra, under Liz Truss, became ""Growth, Growth, Growth"". Since the financial crash in 2008, it's been sluggish.
As tax was put up by Rishi Sunak to repair the damage to public finances from that bank crash and from the pandemic, and to prepare for the rising demographic demands for more social care, the party pushed back.
members recoiled at the taunt that taxes, under Rishi Sunak's stewardship, haven't been as high in 70 years. They preferred the glib tax-cutting agenda of his rival. As premier, armed with their mandate, Liz Truss executed a reckless handbrake turn on taxes, in the hope of picking up speed for growth by going in the opposite direction... and crashed.
many questions about how to piece things together again and what follows. Whoever wins the race for Number 10 has to contend with the guy next door. Jeremy Hunt could be the neighbour from hell, because he effectively represents market discipline.
While (so far) out of the leadership race, the chancellor gets to make many of the crucial choices in his medium-term fiscal plan on Hallowe'en - due only three days after the new leader is elected.
On Friday, he puts his plan to the Office for Budget Responsibility, which judges the effect they can be expected to have on revenues, growth and inflation. It may already be too late for the next prime minister to intervene.
Hunt looks like the person placed on the board of a company in financial distress by its main creditor, wielding a veto over anything else the board might decide.
If the next leader accepts that Hunt remains Chancellor, he will sit at the Cabinet table as the representative of the bond markets. If the next leader doesn't like him there, the bond markets may respond negatively, unless someone replaces him who is at least as hawkish.
made around future budgets are not just for short-term expediency, to get them through the next election. They require Conservatives to decide what path they're on, and what the destination of Brexit is.
How big do they want the British state to be? Are they for leaning in to intervene in investment, as Johnson said he would, to help level up the left-behind parts of Britain? Or are they, like Margaret Thatcher, for rolling back the frontiers of the state, and letting the market allocate resources where they can be deployed most efficiently? 
Will they honour the pledge, renewed on Wednesday by Liz Truss, to increase the pension by the price inflation rate, now at 10.1%, and at what cost to other spending departments? Will those dependent on welfare benefits lose out in real terms, again?
Will they stick with Boris Johnson's expensive pledge on social care, pumping enough money into the system to lower the risk, in England, of having to sell your home if you need to go into a care home? (That spending would feed through to devolved block grants).
Will the next leader show much interest in climate change, as Cameron and Johnson did, but May and Truss did not? If they do, what priority will it have? Will they continue with Liz Truss's pledge to boost defence spending by nearly 50%?
A vital question is how they wish to use the potential of Brexit to re-shape the economy. Liz Truss was for a free enterprise, de-regulated, low tax economy characterised by helping people at the top to earn lots, and keep more of those earnings, while the benefits ""trickle down"".
So long as the economy grows, she was unconcerned with the way in which policy distributed its benefits. She could not acknowledge that a tax giveaway to the highest earners might look unfair, and none of her cabinet seemed to spot that problem until it was too late. Will that approach change?
A vital issue where she clashed with her own choice of home secretary was on immigration. Being tough on it, particularly in stopping free movement of Europeans into British jobs, was one of the main planks of the Tory appeal to voters - and successfully so, as Suella Braverman was pointing out.
reason why Ms Braverman voiced concerns about the emerging deal with India, which may eventually open up goods trade for British exporters in exchange for work permits in Britain.
But in prioritising ""growth, growth, growth"", Liz Truss saw that the obstacles put in the way of recruiting from overseas are holding back the capacity of the British economy to grow.
On that much, she was in tune with business lobbies. Apart from inflation, acute recruitment difficulties are widespread. With polls showing lowered post-Brexit public concern about immigration, the 44-day prime minister was for opening the immigration taps a bit more.
Real, difficult choices were apparent in this summer's leadership contest. The decision taken by Tory members was to go with the feel-good, low-tax, 21st Century Thatcher.
It didn't work. So what are they going to try next?"	/news/uk-scotland-63339214

A Holyrood committee voted to change provisions for 16 and 17-year-olds.
will have to live in their acquired gender for at least six months rather than three before applying for a gender recognition certificate.
Social Justice Minister Shona Robison also said the government supported creating an offence to tackle fraudulent applications.
ges were voted for in a meeting of Holyrood's equalities, human rights and civil justice committee on Tuesday.
Members were considering the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill at its second stage.
A woman was ejected from the committee meeting for refusing to remove a scarf in suffragette colours - the Scottish Parliament's presiding officer later said this was an error.
Scottish government argues that the current process for obtaining a gender recognition certificate is too difficult and invasive, and causes distress to an already marginalised and vulnerable minority group.
Its proposal would see applications handled by the Registrar General for Scotland, rather than the UK panel.
No diagnosis or medical reports would be required, and the period in which adult applicants need to have lived in their acquired gender would be cut to three months.
ge one at the end of October, though seven SNP MSPs defied the whip to vote against it.
Scottish government minister Ash Regan also quit saying her conscience would not allow her to support the plans.
Opponents of the bill have raised concerns about the impact of the legislation on women and girls, while supporters say it will have little impact outside the trans community.
SNP's Christine Grahame proposed a number of amendments at the committee which were backed by the Conservatives' Jackson Carlaw.
Although changes were proposed for 16 and 17-year-olds, the period for living in an acquired gender before an application was maintained as three months for people age 18 and over.
Ms Grahame said she wanted to ""put precautions and support in"" for the younger age group.
Ms Robison said she backed Ms Grahame's amendments, adding: ""Increasing the time period to six months would allow many young people greater opportunity to access guidance before applying, which they can confirm to the registrar general.""
Maggie Chapman, a Green member of the committee, was opposed to the change.
She argued that the age of legal capacity was already set as 16, saying: ""It's almost as if we trust them to make big legal decisions on their own.
""I don't see why this should be any different.""
Conservatives' Russell Findlay also put forward a number of amendments which sought to prevent registered sex offenders from acquiring a gender recognition certificate.
He said the bill as it stands would allow male sex offenders to change their identities, adding that ""prisons are full"" of men who seek to exploit loopholes in the law.
He also raised concerns that female victims of sexual offences may have to refer to male attackers as ""she or her"" in the dock.
Mr Findlay said: ""It risks making a mockery of the justice system and re-traumatising victims of sexual violence.""
Ms Robison said she could not back Mr Findlay's amendment, but said the Scottish government was bringing in other changes.
One of these was a new requirement under the sex offenders notification scheme for offenders to alert police if they made an application for a gender recognition certificate.
Applications could be made to a sheriff if someone believed a certificate was being obtained fraudulently, she said.
minister also said the government backed the ""principle"" of a new offence of fraudulently applying for a gender recognition certificate."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63634397
politics	The political guard is changing again	"September's loser appears on the verge of becoming October's prime minister. 
With the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson out, the firm favourite to be the new prime minister is Rishi Sunak. 
Unless Penny Mordaunt assembles an army of supporters many times greater than those currently signed up, and between now and lunchtime, Mr Sunak's victory could be confirmed this afternoon. 
Whatever happens there'll be a new prime minister by the end of the week. 
Yes, a third prime minister in seven weeks. 
An unprecedented level of turbulence; a calamitous series of events that most Conservatives acknowledge privately has amounted to a circus of absurdity deeply damaging to their party's reputation. 
It has been a weekend that had the ring of familiarity to it for those of us who've reported on events at Westminster for some time. 
question, not for the first time, was this: ""What will Boris Johnson do next?"" 
Having flown back from the Caribbean, he spent Saturday and Sunday doing some attempted telephonic charming - working out how much, or little, support he had in the parliamentary party, just weeks after they got shot of him. 
Consistently, from Saturday afternoon onwards, his team were briefing that they had the necessary numbers to make the ballot. 
A cabinet minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said so publicly.  
Another, Chris Heaton-Harris, went further, saying the necessary paperwork had been submitted to the party, including verified backers, that meant Mr Johnson could join the contest. 
But the reaction to these claims was a reminder of one of the many issues a returning Boris Johnson would have faced - put simply, plenty, including on his own side, don't believe a word he says. 
One of those very MPs did acknowledge to me privately, though, that things might have been very different if Mr Johnson had not been facing an inquiry into whether he misled the House of Commons during the lockdown parties rows. 
Had he not been facing that investigation, the MP suggested, he might well be on his way back to No10. 
But he isn't. 
And he isn't because the numbers just didn't work. It seems, at best, he had persuaded less than a third of the parliamentary party to support him, which would have meant even a victory would have been pyrrhic and potentially disastrous - he knows what it's like to try to govern without the support of your parliamentary party. It doesn't end well. 
And so, the political guard is changing again.  
If it is Rishi Sunak, and there isn't a contest, I hear the King is in London on Monday evening. 
If he's not in the capital before then, and Mr Sunak is confirmed as the winner this afternoon, perhaps he will wait until Tuesday to become prime minister so he can arrive in Downing Street in the light, during the day. 
But let's see. Maybe just maybe, there'll still be a contest. 
What really matters, whoever the winner is, is they will inherit the same groaning basket of problems that proved too heavy for Liz Truss to bear: a deeply divided party, spiralling prices, grim public finances and a chorus of opposition parties saying they have no electoral legitimacy. 
But they'll hope, too, the Conservative Party's apparent insatiable appetite for insurrection may finally be sated. 
If it isn't, a toweringly difficult task will rapidly become impossible. "	/news/uk-politics-63369200
politics	Stephen Flynn: Who is the new SNP Westminster leader?	"Aberdeen South MP Stephen Flynn is set to face his first Prime Minister's Questions less than 24 hours after being elected the SNP's new Westminster leader.
Here is what we know about the 34-year-old and what colleagues expect of him.
Mr Flynn was born in Dundee and raised in the city and in nearby Brechin.
He studied politics at Dundee University before moving to Aberdeen - although he still travels back down the A90 to support Dundee United.
His hip gave way when he was a teenager, and he spent 17 years in ""constant pain"" and facing a ""daily physical and mental battle"" until eventually having replacement surgery in September 2020.
After marrying his wife in 2014, he was elected to Aberdeen City Council in a by-election the following year, and served as the SNP's group leader from 2016 until he became an MP in 2019.
He took Aberdeen South from the Conservatives - a seat which has bounced between Labour, the SNP and Tories at the last four elections.
Following his election as Westminster leader, Nicola Sturgeon congratulated both Flynn and Paisley and Renfrewshire South MP Mhairi Black, who was elected deputy leader, calling them a ""truly formidable team"".
SNP MP Stewart Hosie echoed that sentiment, telling the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""One thing you will see from Stephen is a different tone - perhaps more pointed, snappier, more vibrant. 
""I think he will bring a great deal to the table and a great deal to the independence cause as he holds the government to account.
""Stephen has rare gift of being able to communicate difficult things in a really effective way and I'm looking forward to seeing him deploy that particularly in PMQs today.""
Stephen Flynn says he will push the impact of the cost of living and Scotland's right to choose its future
Mr Flynn's maiden speech in the Commons underlines why colleagues hope he will be a punchy presence as leader.
He warned Conservative members that ""we will not forget, and we will not forgive this government"".
He added: ""Scotland rejects your austerity and Scotland rejects your Brexit, just as Scotland rejected your prime minister.""
Mr Flynn became a prominent member of the so-called Tuesday Club of male SNP MPs who regularly meet for five-a-side football, beer and curry nights.
gas industry is at the heart of his patch, and he initially argued against the idea of a windfall tax on the profits of big energy firms - something later embraced enthusiastically by the SNP.
In February, he told MPs: ""The last time the UK government implemented a windfall tax, investment in the North Sea oil and gas sector plummeted.

politics	NI Protocol: 'Alarm' at uncertainty of supply of animal medicines in NI	"A group of MPs have expressed ""alarm"" at uncertainty over the availability of veterinary medicines as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
upply is covered by a ""grace period"" due to expire on 31 December.
EU Scrutiny Committee said full application EU rules would leave potentially half of all veterinary medicines facing discontinuation.
But the government said that while talks on the protocol continue, it does not intend to apply the EU regulations. 
rotocol means Northern Ireland is still inside the EU's pharmaceutical regulatory system.
However, it gets most of its medicines from Great Britain, which is not.
Earlier this year the EU changed its laws in an effort to help guarantee supplies of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but that arrangement does not cover veterinary medicines.
Earlier this year, the committee wrote to the UK agriculture minister expressing ""profound concerns"" about the issue.
In response the minister, Lord Benyon, said the impending deadline had been raised with the EU and features in current talks.
He has sought to offer reassurance that if no solution is reached. the government ""reserves its right to take action to ensure that animals in Northern Ireland can continue to access the veterinary medicines and vaccines they need"".
mmittee said: ""It is alarming that such uncertainty hangs over the availability of veterinary medicines on the Northern Ireland within a matter of weeks.
""We are pleased that the government is continuing to press the European Commission to find a solution and note that the UK is ready to take unilateral action if necessary.
""We trust, however, that at least a short-term solution can be identified before 31 December, pending a longer-term resolution to the issue."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63964861
politics	Climate change: Where does Rishi Sunak stand ahead of COP27?	"Spin back 12 months to the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow and you couldn't move without tripping over a world leader, a FTSE boss, even the Archbishop of Canterbury.
ference was an enormous affair where hours and hours of negotiations took place about how countries large and small, north and south, could work together to try to slow down climate change and manage its impact.
re was another vital ingredient last year though: political energy. 
re was no doubt that the then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson took the issue seriously. There was a visible desire in the government to act to manage climate change and for the UK to take, and be seen to take, a prominent role. 
re were some grumbles in the Conservative Party but the political push from the top to grasp the issue last year was strong and clear. The UK had to be at the forefront of tackling climate change, and couldn't afford not to.
mics of COP are truly international, and as our climate editor Justin Rowlatt notes here, this week's summit in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh is likely to see the world's poorer countries pitted against the rich nations who they feel have backtracked on the financial commitments made in Glasgow.
But as leaders touch down this weekend for COP27, is the UK's commitment still as strong? 
First off, the simple optics of the last few weeks suggest not. There was a straightforward argument against Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's attendance at COP. He's only just moved into No 10 and the economy is in bad shape. Summits are, putting it politely, not always a good use of important people's time. 
re was also a good case for him to go - to show personal commitment and interest in the subject, and of course to take the opportunity to rub shoulders with other world leaders. 
But changing his mind has sent a different message. One climate expert said: ""The Sunak flip-flop doesn't demonstrate the level of leadership Johnson had."" 
If you forget the fuss about Mr Sunak's change of heart, there are signs that climate change has moved down the agenda since last year.
COP26 chief Alok Sharma was shunted out of the cabinet in the last few weeks which sent the signal, intentional or not, that the new administration is less concerned about the issue. 
During her brief time in office, Liz Truss announced plans for 130 new oil and gas licences - although her tenure in No 10 was too short to approve any. And the UK hasn't yet provided all the cash to help the countries hardest hit by climate change that it promised last year. 
't mean the UK has abandoned all of its efforts, but the political urgency has noticeably faded. One well-informed climate source says ""there is a reasonable question about whether we really have our climate credentials in the right place"". 
mands of short-term politics often shove the desire to solve long-term problems down the list. As one COP insider said: ""Ukraine and serious climate catastrophes this year have made clean energy and action no less important, but domestic worries about the economy and winning elections prevail."" 
But there is a different question being asked too: what is the new prime minister's attitude to climate change? How much does he really care? 
In the next couple of days, now he is going to COP, there will be warm and determined words, perhaps a new commitment or two. 
Mr Sunak said a few days ago ""there is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change"". But there are doubts about his stance. 
One source, normally familiar with the government's plans and instincts on the issue, says ""there is a big question about what he really thinks"". 
Another climate insider worries ""it doesn't feel like he's acting out of conviction and belief"" while one industry source says ""he's never been a naysayer but he has never been a fan"" - adding that during his time in the Treasury ""he was a big sceptic about the cost"".
Climate Basics: CO2 explained
re enormous, of course. A Freedom of Information request for our programme shows just how big the price tag would be even for making public buildings green - an enormous £25-30bn at a time when cash is short. 
When people are worried about keeping the lights on, it's not surprising that some voters also might feel less fussy about where their power comes from. 
But Rishi Sunak's political opponents sniff an opportunity, with Labour believing they can make the case for a faster move to green energy.
With recession approaching they are developing plans to go much further and faster with UK-generated renewables.
re are important questions about how realistic their plans really are. But it's notable that they see political advantage in putting those ideas front and centre. 
One Labour source said Mr Sunak's ""will he, won't he"" attendance at COP ""sent a message round the world with his hokey-cokey on attending COP that the UK is out of the climate leadership business… the world desperately needs climate leaders - but it's not going to come from Rishi Sunak"".
More diplomatically, Claire O'Neill - the former MP and energy minister who was partly responsible for the UK becoming the COP president last year - told me the UK is ""playing defence, not offence"".

politics	COP27: Rishi Sunak urges world to move faster on renewable energy	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to urge world leaders at COP27 to move ""further and faster"" in transitioning to renewable energy. 
Mr Sunak will travel to Egypt on Sunday for the UN climate summit after U-turning on a decision not to go. 
In his address on Monday, he will say Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""reinforced"" the importance of ending dependence on fossil fuels. 
COP27 follows a year of climate-related disasters and record temperatures. 
rime minister will also tell leaders gathered in Sharm el-Sheikh not to ""backslide"" on commitments made at last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow intended to prevent global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.
But Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), has warned that the 1.5C target is ""barely within reach"". 
His comment comes as the UN's weather and climate body released a report showing that the rate at which sea levels are rising has doubled since 1993. 
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has described the report as a ""chronicle of climate chaos"" and urged governments at COP27 to answer the planet's ""distress signal"" with ""ambitious, credible climate action"".
Mr Sunak will meet French President Emmanuel Macron at the summit this week and the topic of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats will likely be raised. 
In a statement before his departure, Mr Sunak said: ""When the world came together in Glasgow last year, nations agreed an historic roadmap for preventing catastrophic global warming. It is more important than ever that we deliver on those pledges.
""Fighting climate change is not just a moral good - it is fundamental to our future prosperity and security.
""Russia's invasion of Ukraine and contemptible manipulation of energy prices has only reinforced the importance of ending our dependence on fossil fuels.
""We need to move further and faster to transition to renewable energy, and I will ensure the UK is at the forefront of this global movement as a clean energy superpower.""
It comes after the prime minister backtracked on attending the summit earlier this week. 
Mr Sunak had originally stated he would not travel to Egypt, arguing that his priority was to plug a £50bn hole in the public finances ahead of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's autumn statement on 17 November. 
Labour's Ed Miliband said the prime minister ""dithered"" about attending the climate summit, adding that: ""Britain needs to be in the climate leadership business.""
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the shadow climate change secretary said it was now ""cheaper to save the planet than to destroy it"". 
""We're in the midst of an energy crisis,"" he said, adding that renewable energy sources were now much cheaper than fossil fuels.
Mr Miliband insisted that switching to renewables was ""the opportunity of the future"" and that this was the ""message we should be taking to COP"".
Mr Sunak's initial decision not to attend the summit was widely criticised by climate campaigners, opposition parties and COP26 President and colleague Alok Sharma.   
Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden has defended the prime minister, saying he was ""committed"" to environmental issues. 
Mr Dowden told Laura Kuenssberg that, when Mr Sunak came to power, his first priority was the economic crisis but that he had worked on the Autumn Statement ""to make sure he can go to this summit"". 
Mr Dowden was also questioned about host country Egypt's human rights record, including its detention of British Egyptian national Alaa Abd El-Fattah, an activist who has been in jail for nine years and is on a hunger strike.
Asked if the prime minister would raise Abdel Fattah's case while at the summit, the cabinet minister said: ""I'm sure he will raise it at appropriate forums"". 
Labour's Mr Miliband said it was a ""very serous issue"" and that he would ""make sure to raise it with the Egyptians while I'm there"". 
rime minister has sent a letter to Abdel Fattah's family pledging that the activist's case is ""a priority for the British government both as a human rights defender and as a British national"". 
However, speaking on Sky News, Abdel Fattah's sister Sanaa Seif said she was concerned No 10's engagement with the Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi would come too late. 
Speaking of her worry that her brother could die while the climate summit was happening, she urged the British government to be ""responsible for getting us proof of life"". 
government has faced criticism for approving new oil and gas licences in the North Sea despite the International Energy Agency saying there can be no more new fossil fuel exploration if the 1.5C target is to be met.
Mr Sunak is expected to chair a meeting of world leaders to drive progress on the pledge signed by 100 countries at Glasgow to halt and reverse deforestation and damaging land use by 2030. 
r of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, said he did not think the climate summit this week would be a success. 
""I don't think there's been the leadership either from our country or frankly from other countries,"" he told Laura Kuenssberg.
Meanwhile the King, who made an address at COP26 last year and is known for his passionate interest in environmental issues, will not be attending the summit after Buckingham Palace agreed with former Prime Minister Liz Truss he would not attend. 
Although Downing Street suggested this week they may have come to a different view if Mr Sunak had been installed in No 10 earlier. 
round of UN climate talks takes place amid a backdrop of increasingly devastating extreme weather around the globe, and an energy and cost-of-living crisis driven by President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. 
COP27 agenda will highlight calls to reduce emissions, help countries deal with climate change, and secure technical support and funding for developing countries. 
UN has also warned that based on countries' latest climate action plans, there is currently no credible pathway to meet the 1.5C goal intended to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.
Rich countries are further falling short in providing finance to help developing nations adapt to climate change, according to the UN.

politics	Rishi Sunak: No more austerity, Mark Drakeford urges PM	"WATCH: Sunak on Truss: ""Some mistakes were made""
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he will tell new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak the last thing the UK needs is more ""Tory austerity"".
He said he wants a ""constructive relationship"" with Mr Sunak, and confirmed on Tuesday they have spoken.
In her 49 days as PM, Liz Truss never spoke to either Mr Drakeford or his Scottish counterpart Nicola Sturgeon.
Welsh MP Craig Williams, a former Sunak aide, said the PM will work with Mr Drakeford ""in the national interest"".
Montgomeryshire Conservative MP added that a ""respectful and mature relationship"" is needed between the two governments.
Mr Sunak, who has become the third prime minister in seven weeks, said bringing the Conservative Party and the UK together would be his ""utmost priority"".
On Tuesday evening, Mr Drakeford tweeted that he had spoken to Mr Sunak on his first day in office, adding that he had ""a chance to congratulate the prime minister and discuss the importance of working together as four nations to address the urgent challenges we face as a United Kingdom"".
Mr Sunak also tweeted that it was ""good to speak"" to both Mr Drakeford and Ms Sturgeon, adding: ""I emphasised our duty to work closely together to respond to the shared challenges we face, so that collectively we can deliver for the people of the United Kingdom"".
Speaking earlier at First Minister's Questions in the Senedd, Mr Drakeford said he would be raising the issues of the economy, the future of the Tata steelworks in Wales, and the future of the UK. 
""Of course I will say that the very last thing that people in Wales, or across the United Kingdom, will need is a further dose of Tory austerity,"" he said.
""The Welsh government is the only other unambiguously unionist government with which he will have contact and I will want to work with him for a successful future for the United Kingdom.""
Mr Drakeford added that the future of Tata should be ""high on his list of priorities"". 
Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price suggested that instead of waiting for Downing Street to initiate the call to the Welsh government ""we could break with tradition and proactively call them"".  
""They may refuse to take the call but it would be a symbol of self-confidence and a message that we see the relationship as equals,"" he said.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast earlier, Mr Williams said: ""Rishi Sunak today becomes the prime minister of Wales as well as England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and we need to work really closely together, we need to put egos, political ideologies aside. 
""Mark Drakeford, at the core of him, is a good man and I know Rishi Sunak is a good man. I think they'll both work in the national interest."" 
Watch: Outgoing PM Liz Truss vows ""brighter days lie ahead""
Later, at a Welsh government news conference, Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said she hoped Mr Sunak ""makes contact with our first minister at the earliest possible opportunity"".
She added: ""I do think that it demonstrates a willingness to work together for people and, at the end of the day, that's what people want.
""They want governments which work and collaborate effectively for their benefit, which I think is the appropriate thing to do.""
Ms Evans said an early phone call also showed ""respect to devolution and to devolved governments"" in the UK."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63386472
politics	World Cup: Wales' economy minister defends Qatar visit	"Wales' economy minister has said the nation must not give up the global promotion opportunity of the World Cup.
Vaughan Gething defended Welsh government visits to Qatar and said there is a ""great deal more interest in Wales"" because of the team's presence.
He has met Qatar's finance minister and said they spoke about its investment interest and ""Wales' values"".
But he also said world football governing body Fifa ""need to keep their promises"".
Mr Gething told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We can be proud that we are on this global stage, but there's a great deal more interest in Wales because we are here"".
During his visit, he watched the Wales players training before their key game against England, and met manager Robert Page.
Before his visit, he had defended the decision for ministers to go, insisting they ""won't be turning a blind eye"" to human rights abuses.
Labour Welsh government to go is in contrast to the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who stayed at home in protest at Qatar's human rights record.
Mr Gething said: ""It is about not surrendering this global opportunity for Wales, we can be proud that we are on this global stage... but there's a great deal more interest in Wales because we are here"".
Of his meeting with Ali bin Ahmed Al Kuwari, Qatar's finance minister, Mr Gething said: ""We spoke about Wales' values. When we said we'd talk about our values, we're doing what we said we'd do.
""We discussed a range of options where Qatar is interested in further investment, they have interest in diversifying their own economy, because they recognise that the increase in value of natural gas because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, won't last forever.
""I want to stay engaged in the future, it's one of the areas where Fifa needs to keep their promises, because at this point they haven't done what they said they'd do.""
Fifa head Gianni Infantino has accused the West of ""hypocrisy"" in its reporting of the Qatari record on human rights, and said that ""change takes time"".
Fifa has also claimed that the Qatar World Cup would be carbon neutral, which environmentalists said was ""dangerous and misleading"".
Mr Gething said Wales is playing its part in conversations about change in Qatar, which he believes is happening slowly.
""We are looking to engage with Qatar and other countries in the region and to talk authentically about why we're proud of the Wales we are today,"" he said.
""It's more than just supporting the team, it's about the fact that Wales has a global platform, and the profile we have is a real opportunity to get the world to consider coming to Wales, but also Wales to go out to the world.""

politics	Gwent Police: New messages reveal more misconduct allegations	"Welsh secretary has said he is ""appalled"" following fresh allegations of misconduct within a police force.
Conservative MP David TC Davies, said the activities reported by the Sunday Times, if proved, are ""unacceptable"". 
report revealed new findings of misogyny, racism, homophobia and corruption within Gwent Police, including among serving officers.
It comes after an initial probe was sparked by messages found on the phone of officer Ricky Jones after his death.
Speaking on Sunday's BBC Politics Wales programme, Mr Davies, MP for Monmouthshire and a former police officer, said: ""As somebody who spent nine years serving as a police officer I'm absolutely appalled by it. I didn't see behaviour like that myself, although I was in a different force. 
""But I know [Chief Constable] Pam Kelly well, and I know that she will be absolutely appalled by the alleged behaviour and she will be fully investigating. In fact she's confirmed that she's doing so and rightly so."" 
Mr Davies added that ""there are individuals letting the force down"" and ""the majority of police officers do a very good job in difficult circumstances, and are as angry as we are"". 
Sunday Times report revealed messages including jokes between serving and retired officers about sexual predator Jimmy Savile; a video of a woman stripping; leaked nude images; and an officer saying a colleague carried a ""sex kit"" in the boot of his car. 
In one message, a retired officer reportedly referred to a female officer and said: ""I actually got her to lift her skirt in Cardiff once.""
Ruth Jones, Labour MP for Newport West, said the situation ""continued to appal"". 
She added: ""We need to be able to trust officers to police fairly and without discrimination, and at the moment we're in real danger of trust being irrevocably lost between the public and police force.""
Ms Jones added that the force had ""serious questions to answer"" and supported calls for a national inquiry. 
""We need to leave no stone left unturned,"" she said. 
Chief Constable Pam Kelly said: ""The initial complaint raised by the Jones family did not include the conduct matters now emerging and, as new issues come to light, we will continue to take swift and robust action.""
She said the force ""will not tolerate"" such behaviour, adding: ""We continue to be horrified by the comments and material shared by retired officers and a small number of serving officers. 
""These behaviours and attitudes have no place in Gwent Police and we will continue our ongoing work with our colleagues to set out clear expectations around the standards that both we and the public expect.""  
Police Federation of Wales and England admitted the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IPOC) investigation could be ""horrendously slow"".
But Nicky Ryan, the federation's Welsh lead told Radio Wales Breakfast: ""It must be done expeditiously. That's the only way the public's confidence can be restored.""
She added: ""From our point of view, we want any individuals found responsible out of the force as much as anyone else.""
Welsh government has previously said it would consider a national inquiry into the allegations.
A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Police forces must root out officers and staff who do not meet acceptable standards of behaviour to restore the public's trust, which has been shattered by recent high-profile events. 
""The Home Office plays an active role in pushing for changes, including by establishing the Angiolini Inquiry [following the murder of Sarah Everard in London] which is looking at issues around police culture and the safety of women, as well as announcing a targeted review of police dismissals to ensure the system can remove officers who are not fit to serve."""	/news/uk-wales-63689022
politics	Laura Kuenssberg: 'No coups, no plots - nobody cares'	"""There are no coups, there are no plots,"" a cabinet minister confides about conversations with colleagues. After a year of almost unparalleled political skulduggery, that is a pretty decent gift to go under Rishi Sunak's Christmas tree. 
But at the risk of being Scrooge, is the season of apparent peace and goodwill really a triumph, or a sign of something else? This member of the government suggests there is no dodgy manoeuvring going on, not because Number 10 has conquered all, but after years of arguing amongst themselves and wasted opportunity, ""nobody cares any more"" - ouch! The mood inside the Tory Party is ""defeatist"". Another cabinet minister admits the party is ""in the last chance saloon"".
During 2022 two powerful myths have been shown to be just that. First, Boris Johnson's legendary ability to survive serious scrapes and scandals was exhausted. Whatever your own view of what some saw as the Tories' joker king, his exit has transformed the landscape. It has deprived the party of not only their best campaigner, but a leader who could dominate the headlines at the drop of a hat. On a good day - which became vanishingly rare - this was a massive asset. 
Second, the assumption that it would be impossible for Keir Starmer to turn Labour around in a single term looks flimsy now. The leader does publicly, and regularly, warn against complacency in his ranks. But Labour's front bench is starting to look like a group of people who believe they'll be the ones at the cabinet table, and whizzing around in ministerial cars, in 18 months or so. Both of those shifts are profound and have affected the Conservatives' sense of themselves - the man who was their winner has gone, and their rivals look more like an outfit that could do it.
What could also make some Conservatives maudlin over the Christmas sherry is a building sense of wasted opportunity, what one party veteran even calls starkly, ""years of political failure"". One minister says: ""The Boris years were a massive missed opportunity and an aberration."" 
Another senior Conservative goes back further in time, to the Theresa May administration in the chaotic aftermath of the Brexit vote - whether social care, housing, planning, energy, ""all of the challenges that needed to be addressed [weren't], instead we got into no majority, then neuralgia and parliamentary stalemate"". The Conservative party's own disagreements created its own headache. 
It would be ludicrous to forget the role of the pandemic in later years, and then, of course, Russian tanks across the Ukrainian border. Rishi Sunak's government, like Liz Truss's administration, and Boris Johnson before, have had to confront a set of epic problems that have confounded governments across the west. 
But just because the job is hard, that doesn't mean it is inevitable that a political party screams at itself about who should do it. Having three prime ministers in a single year is no party's political dream. And many of the problems that Rishi Sunak has had to grapple with were on the to-do list for his predecessors long before the pandemic, or the conflict in Ukraine. 
It is an extraordinary political achievement for any party to have stayed in office for so long. But there is a question being asked more loudly in the Conservative Party about what was it is all really for. Theresa May's hopes of making big changes to the country were killed off by her losing her majority, then the Conservatives losing their minds in their wild Brexit disagreements. 
Boris Johnson's promises were scuppered by the realities of the pandemic, but his exit was forced by a succession of his own messes. Liz Truss temporarily excited her backers with bold goals, but the screeching pace of her plans left them in flames. One saddened former minister says: 'We've wasted the mandate… covid is partly responsible, but when you get an 80 majority what can you show for it? There are a lot of people now who can't see a way through.""
Yet, several government ministers tell me they are happier than they have been for years. That seeming Christmas calm is allowing them to do their jobs, without the daily drama. Rishi Sunak's pleasing some of his colleagues, including some of those who didn't back him, for his attention to detail, and overall approach. They tell me that he actually reads the documents he is given - I wonder who they could be comparing him with? He's been busy inviting backbenchers to meetings around the cabinet table, hosting World Cup matches with beer flowing for colleagues, trying to avoid the bitterness inside the party of recent years.
re are dividends. Some politicians, like many of the public, were thoroughly fed up of the endless soap opera in SW1. One minister tells me, ""We had to remove the chaos,"" and is profoundly relieved that they can ""get on with governing now"". 
Several cite the prime minister's plans to stem the arrivals of small boats on the south coast as evidence of him getting to grips with issues. A senior minister tells me the ""Labour vote is soft"" believing, the election is ""absolutely all to play for"". But for the public, the end of political shenanigans matters far less than the very real problems going on in so many areas. 
A calmer atmosphere in Westminster doesn't pay the bills, a more peaceful political environment doesn't get you to A&E, Conservatives being nicer to each other after years of tearing each other apart doesn't put food on the table. There is plenty of Tory relief that the litany of political crises of recent years has stilled, but real-life crises are here and all too obvious. And the political pressures is still real, with the Conservatives woefully behind in regular polls. One former minister says: ""Stabilising in the 20s is no use to man nor beast.""
It's our last show of 2022 on Sunday, when we'll try to make sense of what has happened. It's anyone's guess as to how things will develop in the next few months. We know that Rishi Sunak wants to spell out more of what he stands for early in the new year. Expect a highly anticipated, much vaunted ""big speech"" soon.  
re are rumblings on the right that he needs to demonstrate more ""proper Conservative"" values after what has been described as one former minister as ""soggy blancmange"" so far. It is also likely that Liz Truss will appear to try to account for what went wrong but claim her credo still has merit. 
It is the end, for now, of many years of political frenzy. A pause after years of successive prime ministers being consumed by events, and internal problems. But Rishi Sunak may be plagued by problems not of his own making, and the calm he has created may not be enough to keep the Conservatives in power."	/news/uk-politics-64007689

However, on Monday the EU's chief Brexit negotiator confirmed the grace period will be extended to 2025. 
Maros Sefcovic said the EU Commission had ""taken steps to ensure the continuity of supplies of veterinary medicines to Northern Ireland, but also Cyprus, Ireland and Malta"".

politics	Rishi Sunak urged to raise defence spending by Estonia	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is being urged to raise UK defence spending by a key eastern European ally.
Estonia, which borders Russia, has hosted British troops on rotation for years.  
Its foreign minister Urmas Reinsalu told the BBC it was ""vital"" all Nato countries spend 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence. 
Mr Sunak has not matched a pledge, set by predecessor Liz Truss, to meet that target by 2030.
w prime minister, who replaced Ms Truss in Downing Street this week, has previously described such targets as ""arbitrary"". 
However, he also said he believed in ""investing in our armed forces"" during his campaign to be Tory leader over the summer. 
UK currently spends just over 2% of GDP - a measure of the size of the economy - a year on defence. 
Asked whether countries in the Nato defensive alliance, including the UK, should aim to spend 3% of GDP on defence, Mr Reinsalu replied: ""Absolutely.""
He described Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a ""game-changer"".
""Autocrats are investing in weapons,"" he told the BBC. ""They believe in [the] power of arms."" 
Nato estimates Estonia, which shares a 183-mile border with Russia and has a population of 1.3 million people, will spend 2.3% of its GDP on defence in 2022. Estonian ministers say they will raise this to 3% by 2024. 
Nato countries committed in 2014 to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence by 2024. Only nine members expected to meet that target this year.
""To defend our values - the rules based order - we need also to invest to the weapons,"" Mr Reinsalu said.
He also urged Britain not to cut troop numbers in Estonia, saying: ""We love UK soldiers"" and ""we want more"". 
A UK-led battlegroup has been based in Estonia since 2017, as part of a wider set of multinational Nato deployments in eastern Europe.
Around the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, Britain's presence was nearly doubled in the Baltic nation, with around 700 more soldiers.
However those additional troops are set to be withdrawn by the end of this year, leaving around 900 UK personnel in Estonia. 
Discussions are said to be ongoing about plans for further British support that might better suit Estonia's longer-term needs.  
Mr Reinsalu said troop numbers should not be cut, but rather raised. 
""I think [it is] very important not to give any mis-interpretative signals towards Russia,"" he added.
He also called on the West to deliver more heavy weapons to Ukraine without ""any political caveats"", adding the UK had set a ""good example"" in this area.
In a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr Sunak promised to maintain British support to Ukraine but some major European countries, such as Germany and France, have faced accusations of being too slow to provide arms. 
Mr Reinsalu said the West must be ""determined"" and that Kyiv must not be pressured into making concessions towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""Are we successors of Chamberlain or Churchill?"" he asked, referring to two former British prime ministers.
Neville Chamberlain was associated with a policy of appeasement towards Hitler's Nazi Germany in the 1930s.
When that policy failed, he was succeeded by the famous war-time leader Winston Churchill.
""We need to look towards a Ukrainian victory. Then we will not be ashamed to look ourselves [in the] mirror,"" said Mr Reinsalu. 
UK Ministry of Defence said the additional British troops sent to Baltics countries earlier this year were ""always a temporary deployment"". 
A spokesperson added that forces will be held at high readiness in the UK for rapid reinforcement across the Baltic region. 
""Our commitment to Nato and Estonia in response to Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine is absolute,"" the spokesperson added.
Further details of UK defence spending will be set out in the autumn statement due on 17 November. "	/news/uk-politics-63397598
politics	Scotland gender reforms: PM says reasonable for UK to look at law	"Rishi Sunak has said it is ""completely reasonable"" for the UK government to examine Scottish reforms making it easier for people to change gender. 
Scottish Parliament voted to lower the age when people can apply to change their legal gender to 16, and remove the need for a medical diagnosis.
But this has prompted a clash with the UK government who have concerns over safety for women and children. 
Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish government says it will fight attempts to stop it.
On Thursday, members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) voted by 86 votes to 39 to approve the controversial self-identification system, which makes it easier for people to obtain a gender recognition certification (GRC). 
UK government could prevent the legislation becoming law by blocking Royal Assent - when the Bill gets formal agreement by the King and becomes an Act of the Scottish Parliament. It has also not ruled out mounting a legal challenge. 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said many people in Scotland had concerns about the bill.
While visiting a homeless shelter in London, he said: ""I think it is completely reasonable for the UK government to have a look at it, understand what the consequences are for women and children's safety in the rest of the UK, and then decide on what the appropriate course of action is.""
Scottish Secretary Alister Jack warned: ""We will look closely at that, and also the ramifications for the 2010 Equality Act and other UK-wide legislation, in the coming weeks - up to and including a Section 35 order stopping the Bill going for Royal Assent if necessary.""
Under UK law, the UK government can apply to have Scottish laws struck down by arguing they would conflict with UK-wide equalities legislation. This power has not been used before.
But a spokesman for the Scottish government warned that any attempt by Westminster ""to undermine the democratic will of the Scottish Parliament will be vigorously contested"".
Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Scotland's Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said the Scottish government was very confident of its position.
She added: ""The bill as passed is absolutely within legislative competence and of course was backed by an overwhelming majority with support from all parties. 
""It would be unfortunate to say the least of the UK government were to go down this road.""
Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton told the programme he would be ""dismayed"" if the UK government chose to block the bill.
""I think it's inevitable that this bill will end up in court in one way or another but I am confident that we have given it the diligence and scrutiny and tested it in Parliament to ensure it will withstand any court challenge,"" he added.
Previously, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she would ""never apologise for trying to spread equality, not reduce it, in our country"".
Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill's opponents, including nine SNP MSPs who voted against it, have fears over its potential impact on women and girls, in particular single-sex spaces, like toilets. 
Scottish government insists little will change and exceptions barring trans people from single-sex space in some circumstances in the Equality Act will stand. 
Dr Michael Foran, a lecturer in public law at Glasgow University, highlighted how there was a section in the bill which says it will not change any provisions in the Equality Act - and for that reason it is probably within Holyrood's competence.
But he said this did not mean the bill had not changed the law ""as it relates to the Equality Act"".
He explained: ""One of the protected characteristics is sex and if they change who can be covered under one category of sex vs the other that could have an effect on how the Equality Act operates. That's quite a technical legal argument but it would open the door for challenges.""
Meanwhile Helen Belcher, head of charity Trans Actual which campaigns for trans rights, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme the Scottish law would not affect the Equality Act.
""The Equality Act is not within the Scottish Parliament's jurisdiction to change,"" she said. 
She added that trans rights should not be restricted ""on the basis of a few people"" who could take advantage of reforms to the law.
""It won't come as a shock to your listeners that criminals do nasty things, criminals break the law. But that's not necessarily a reason to prevent trans people from being treated with a bit of respect,"" she said.
g of controversial gender reform laws receive mixed reaction in the Scottish Parliament
People in Scotland have been able to change their legal gender from male to female or female to male since 2005.
Scottish government believes the existing process can be intrusive and distressing and put people off applying for a Gender Recognition Certificate.
w rules, which are expected to come into force some time next year, will mean applicants will now only need to have lived in their acquired gender for three months - or six months if they are aged 16 and 17 - rather than two years.
re will be also be a three-month ""reflection period"" during which they can change their minds and it will be a criminal offence to make a false declaration or false application for a GRC, with anyone who does so potentially facing up to two years in prison.
It will be possible to de-transition by going through the process again.
Nine other European countries have already adopted self-declaration systems for legal gender recognition, including the Irish Republic, Denmark, Norway, Portugal and Switzerland.
Also on Thursday, Spain passed a bill bringing it a step closer to allowing people to change their officially registered gender by filling in a form."	/news/uk-64073323
politics	Scottish Budget: What might it mean for you?	"John Swinney is to outline the Scottish government's tax and spending plans for the next year as the country grapples with a cost of living crisis and soaring inflation. 
Some of what the finance secretary announces could affect your take-home pay - while other decisions will have an impact on Scotland's public services. 
BBC Scotland asked some of our experts what the key things to look out for in the budget could be.
At Westminster, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is freezing income tax thresholds while holding the rates steady. That is a substantial stealth tax on earners as their pay goes through these thresholds, and with inflation, many people are doing just that. 
Not to freeze thresholds in Scotland would be a tax giveaway, relative to England at least. It would be difficult financially not to follow the Chancellor in doing that, and politically it would be odd not to take that more progressive approach. 
Mr Hunt also reduced the threshold at which additional rate is paid at 45p for each extra pound earned. That is coming down from £150,000, which is the level it has been at for more than a decade, to just over £125,000.  Again, it would be odd for the SNP, which levies that tax at a rate of 46p in the pound, not to do something similar.
For higher earners, Scotland already has a higher tax rate than the rest of the UK, by 1p in the pound. Mr Swinney could choose to raise that further. But higher tax, while household budgets are being squeezed by inflation, could harm efforts to return the economy to growth.
Other important decisions include council tax. Will Mr Swinney constrain the ability of councils to raise their tax bills, as he did for several years as finance secretary? While Green MSPs are pressing for major reform of council tax, there's a lot more talking before that happens.
Having missed seven of the last eleven targets on reducing emissions, the Scottish government's climate credentials are very much at stake in this budget.
Ministers took a major hammering last week from the Climate Change Committee which said there was no delivery plan for cutting harmful greenhouse gases and progress on delivery had stalled.
As campaigners will point out, time to act is rapidly running out with Holyrood legally committed to cutting emissions by 75% by 2030.
response last week from ministers was that a climate change plan next year will set out its stall but that won't take effect until after 2030.
What the committee wants is an immediate ramping up of action and that costs money.
Green minister Patrick Harvie recently announced grants of up to £7,500 for people to install heat pumps which is a vital step away from heating our homes with gas.
But the budget for that - £42m - will only enable the conversion of 5,600 of the 2.67 million homes in Scotland.
So the cost of change is colossal and this will be the moment where we'll see if the first minister is prepared to put her money where her mouth is.
Health and social care receives by far the biggest share of the Scottish budget - £18bn last year - but the Audit Scotland public spending watchdog has consistently warned it is financially unsustainable.
re are so many competing interests for the money, from energy to heat 1,500 buildings to policy commitments such as funding a new National Care Service.  
f medicines and drugs last year was £2.7bn and there are ever-growing numbers of patients needing treatment. 
But the highest spend is on staff at £8.6bn for 2020/2021 - £1bn more than the previous year. 
government has already made cuts in primary care, mental health and Covid spending to cover an increased pay offer to staff and strikes have so far been averted, unlike other parts of the UK.  
But while some unions have accepted the new offer, others like the Royal College of Nursing are still consulting members and have threatened to strike.
With the need to recruit even more staff to meet demand the question for this budget will be what has to give to pay for it?
for a new National Care Service would end the ""postcode lottery"" for social care, claims the Scottish government.
Others argue the proposals don't go far enough to address poor pay for carers and inequities in a system largely run for profit.
However the service ends up, concerns were raised by Holyrood's finance committee about a lack of clarity on the actual costs of delivering reform of Scotland's care sector by 2026.
Audit Scotland believes the Scottish government's cost predictions of £500m are ""understated"".
John Swinney now faces a choice of whether to spend tens of millions this year toward setting up the new service of tomorrow, or whether to hold that funding back for the problems of today.
might include increasing support for the poorest families during the cost of living crisis, with many households struggling to cope with rising energy bills.

politics	Is cost of living causing children to miss school in Wales?	"re are calls for an urgent government investigation into children missing school due to the cost of living crisis.
One in five pupils from poorer backgrounds were persistently absent last year, official figures show.
A Senedd report says there needs to be more understanding of the problems facing families, such as travel, uniform, and school trip costs.
Welsh government said improving attendance is a ""national priority"".
Persistent absence is when a pupil misses more than 20% of classes over the school year.
report, following an inquiry by the Children, Young People and Education Committee, said it had received evidence that school closures during the pandemic led to a ""more accepting attitude to lower school attendance"", and suggested a public campaign is needed to help reverse the trend.
Figures for October this year highlight a difference for pupils eligible for free school meals.
Attendance for those who can get free meals is at 86.9%, while those who do not qualify have a better attendance at 93.1%. 
Children's Commissioner for Wales Rocio Cifuentes told the inquiry attendance figures were also ""significantly lower"" for children in year groups not entitled to free travel and that tackling child poverty should be a ""key driver in reducing absence"".
Jayne Bryant, the committee's Labour chairwoman, said sending children to school was an ""expensive business"".
""Parents have to find money for uniforms, books, technology, stationery, school bags, school trips, after school clubs,"" she said. 
""The lack of free transport is also an issue for many - in a cost of living crisis with rising inflation, this is getting even harder every day.
""Today, we're calling on the Welsh government to get to the bottom of how rising costs are impacting pupil attendance and to start campaigns nationwide and locally reinforcing the importance of school attendance.""
As Covid hit education, ministers discouraged councils from fining parents for not ensuring children go to school.
But in May, amid worries about attendances, councils were asked to go back to pre-pandemic guidance.
Education Minister Jeremy Miles emphasised fines should be a ""last-resort"" and would only be used in the most extreme cases.
Responding to the report, Mr Miles said several steps had been taken to support families and schools, including £4m for family engagement officers to work with families and pupils.
""This year we also provided £24m which was focused on learners in exam years, including dedicated funding for an attendance officer in each local authority to support learners,"" he added."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63590367

politics	Jeremy Corbyn: I do not see ex-leader standing for Labour, says Starmer	"Sir Keir Starmer has said he does not see how ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could stand as the party's candidate at the next election.
Mr Corbyn was suspended from Labour in 2020 over his response to a report that found anti-Semitism in its ranks.
rty's governing body reinstated him as a Labour member, but Sir Keir barred him from representing the party.
Mr Corbyn says it would be more democratic for the party's election candidates to be chosen by its members.
x-Labour leader, who has represented Islington North since 1983, could potentially stand as an independent candidate.
He won the seat in 2019 with a 26,000 vote majority and Mr Corbyn remains popular with the left wing of the party who helped propel him to the Labour leadership in 2015.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Keir said: ""I don't see the circumstances in which he will stand at the next election as a Labour MP.""
Asked if he believed Mr Corbyn could stand as an independent against a Labour candidate, he added: ""I can only speak for the Labour Party, I can't speak for Jeremy on this.""
A few hours afterwards, Mr Corbyn tweeted that party members should be able to pick election candidates, set policy and ""decide what their movement stands for"".
Referencing a newly-announced Labour blueprint for transferring power away from Westminster, he added this would ensure ""the same principles of devolution and democracy"" are respected by political parties. 
Mr Corbyn had the whip removed and was suspended by Labour after the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found that the party had breached the Equalities Act over its handling of complaints of anti-Semitism during Mr Corbyn's time in charge.
In his initial response to the EHRC report, Mr Corbyn claimed the scale of antisemitism in the party had been ""dramatically overstated for political reasons"" by opponents both inside and outside Labour, along with the media.
But he later attempted to clarify his comments in a statement to the party, saying concerns about anti-Semitism were ""neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'"".
A panel made up of members of the party's National Executive Committee readmitted Mr Corbyn to the Labour party a month after he was suspended. After it decided to readmit Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir tweeted that it had been a ""painful day for the Jewish community and those Labour members who have fought so hard to tackle anti-Semitism"".
While sitting as an independent MP, Mr Corbyn has repeatedly clashed with the party's leadership.
In April, he called for Nato be disbanded to ""bring peace"" after the war in Ukraine ends.
At the time Sir Keir said the Labour party's position is ""not to accept the false equivalence between Russian aggression and the acts of Nato"" and to support the transatlantic military alliance."	/news/uk-politics-63857810
politics	Brexit: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol?	"Northern Ireland Protocol has been a source of tension since it came into force at the start of 2021.
UK and European Union (EU) are holding talks on a way forward.
But disagreements over the protocol have stopped the Northern Ireland Assembly functioning and mean new elections may have to be held.
Northern Ireland Protocol is a trading arrangement, negotiated during Brexit talks. It allows goods to be transported across the Irish land border without the need for checks.
Before Brexit, it was easy to transport goods across this border because both sides followed the same EU rules. After the UK left, special trading arrangements were needed because Northern Ireland has a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU.
EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries. 
's why a new system - the Northern Ireland Protocol - was needed.
rder is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's troubled political history. It was feared that cameras or border posts could lead to instability.
UK and the EU agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal - the Good Friday Agreement - was an absolute priority. 
So, both sides signed the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
It is now part of international law.
Instead of checking goods at the Irish border, the protocol agreed that any inspections and document checks would be conducted between Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ireland. 
ke place at Northern Ireland's ports. 
It was also agreed that Northern Ireland would keep following EU rules on product standards. 
government wants to create red lanes and green lanes for goods imported from Britain into Northern Ireland.
green lane would be for trusted traders transporting goods to Northern Ireland only. These would be exempt from checks and customs controls. 
red lane would be for products going to the EU, including the Republic of Ireland. These would undergo full checks and customs controls.
x rules would also be changed. Northern Irish businesses currently follow EU rules on state aid and VAT. That means government payments to help firms in Northern Ireland, and tax breaks, must be within limits set by the EU. 
UK government wants to remove these limits.
It also wants an independent body to settle disputes over the Northern Ireland Protocol, rather than the European Court of Justice.
UK government is threatening to make changes without the agreement of the EU.
Unionist parties support Northern Ireland being part of the UK. They argue that placing an effective border across the Irish Sea undermines Northern Ireland's place within the UK.
Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the DUP, is refusing to take part in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government unless its concerns are resolved.
Even though the DUP came second in May's elections to Sinn Fein - a nationalist party that accepts the protocol - a new Northern Ireland government cannot be formed without its support. 
government says it is allowed to change the terms of an international agreement, like the protocol, in order to ""safeguard an essential interest"".
It says disputes about the protocol threaten to undermine peace in Northern Ireland. 
On 15 June the European Commission took legal action against the UK for not keeping to the protocol, and called on the government to return to negotiations.
It said it was not prepared to renegotiate the protocol, but has offered to work on how the rules apply, including:

politics	What's happening in Parliament next week?	"A period of calm ahead? After a fortnight of concentrated political drama the agenda for the coming week is crammed with worthy legislation to sooth the jangled nerves of our parliamentarians. 
It won't now be the week of a mini-budget or autumn statement. Jeremy Hunt's planned market-steadying financial package is postponed to 17 November - as was always likely - while the new prime minister vets it. 
So expect question times to be dominated by speculation about its content. What cuts are on, and off the Treasury table?
'll be big with a fiscal black hole estimated at £50bn plus. The expectation is that both current spending and promised increases will face the axe - getting to 3% of GDP on defence looks a distant dream, for example.  
Eyes will be peeled for further turmoil on the Tory benches. There was a brief kerfuffle this week when the Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt didn't turn up at the normal time to announce the forthcoming agenda, resulting in an unusual hour long suspension of the Commons.
It turned out the hiatus was caused by a clash between her duties as Leader of the House of Commons and as Lord President of the Council. She was busy swearing-in new ministers to the Privy Council in the presence of the King.
was an unavoidable clash between the royal diary and the parliamentary diary; irresistible force meets immovable object. 
's unlikely to recur, but it was a rather untidy moment. The nervous twitch with which many greeted the incident was telling evidence of continuing political jumpiness.
Meanwhile, there's more churn on the committee corridor, after the string of government reshuffles caused vacancies for the chairs of the Health, Treasury, Education and Transport committees.
Jeremy Hunt, Mel Stride, Robert Halfon and Huw Merriman are now all ministers. All four chairs are reserved for Conservative MPs, under the share-out agreed by the parties. 
So far, former health minister Steve Brine and Anne Marie Morris have been nominated for health - with other contenders collecting signatures.

They tend to go for the candidate they a) hate least and b) think will cause the most trouble for the government.

Speaking in a Welsh Parliament debate on mental health, Gareth Davies said he had been ""suicidal and had a plan"".
While he said he was much better now he occasionally suffers set backs.
MS said it was vital ""the right infrastructure"" is there to help sufferers.
Bipolar disorder is a health condition where individuals exhibit extreme swings of mood, which can last for several weeks.
It has a high risk of suicide, but many people with it can be treated with medication.
Mr Davies, who was elected to represent the Vale of Clwyd in 2021 and is a Conservative, told the Senedd: ""I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years ago and spent a brief time in hospital as I was suicidal and had a plan"".
""The only reason I got in this mindset was due to my own ignorance in not dealing with what I knew was a problem for a sustained period of time.
""Like a lot of young men, I thought to myself, 'Just pull yourself together, go for a pint and it will be fine.'""
Mr Davies said he took three months off work, had professionals visit him home daily and undertook ""a long programme of medication, talking therapies and treatment"".
""I had to build myself back up again from scratch, and I'm a better person for doing so, but I was only able to do this thanks to a team of professionals, together with many protecting factors, including my wife and understanding family and friends.""
""I'd be fibbing to say that it's a case of problem solved. Yes, I'm a lot better now, but I still have my wobbles from time to time, which set me back slightly,"" he said.

politics	Schools: Teacher prepared to strike despite feeling guilty	"rs to vote on strike: ""It's about safeguarding education""
A teacher said she's prepared to strike, despite feeling guilty about pupils who could lose out on education.
Lowri Lewis Williams, from Denbighshire, said strikes were needed to ""safeguard the future of teaching"".
It comes as teachers in Wales and other parts of the UK are being asked to vote on industrial action after being offered below-inflation pay rises.
It could lead to strikes in the new year after unions rejected a 5% pay offer from the Welsh government.
Union boss Neil Butler said the offer was ""not good enough"" and amounts to a 5% decrease given inflation.
Education Minister Jeremy Miles said the unions' demands were reasonable but a bigger increase was unaffordable.
wo biggest teaching unions start sending ballots to members this week, with others due to follow.
""Teachers have had their pay eroded by inflation for the last 12 years,"" said Mr Butler, of the NASUWT teachers union.
""In fact, teachers' pay has been eroded to the point of 25%, they've lost a quarter of their wage in the last 12 years, enough is enough."" 
In July, the Welsh government accepted the recommendations of the Independent Welsh Pay Review Body, which said teachers should get a 5% pay rise this year with the possibility of a further 3.5% uplift next year.
It would mean starting salaries for new teachers would rise to £28,866, before rising to a minimum of £30,000 next year. 
rs' pay depends on their experience and any extra responsibilities they take on - salaries for more experienced classroom teachers would rise to £44,450.
Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies' Luke Sibieta suggested it amounted to a 3% pay cut after inflation and a 10% reduction since 2010.
""[Morale] is extremely low. And teachers are not just worried about their own positions, they're worried about the future of the education service,"" added Mr Butler.
""We think our ask is extremely reasonable, we want to sit around a table and say if you can't afford 12% what are you going to offer? Because 5% frankly isn't good enough.""
Helen Johns, a teacher and union rep from Rhondda Cynon Taf, said their pay had dropped in value for the past 12 years.
""I feel very strongly that enough is enough,"" she said.
""The system wouldn't run if there wasn't goodwill from teachers - and I think our goodwill has been taken advantage of. 
""Youngsters aren't coming into the profession.
""If we don't stand up now I think we're selling teachers in the future down the river"".
Using another measure of inflation, she said the actual drop in real terms was closer to 20%.
Andrea Jones, a secondary school teacher from Abercrave, Powys, said several teachers she knew left the profession recently for jobs less stress and more pay.
""We have people who are bringing in breakfasts for children, we have people who are bringing in clothes and they simply can't afford it.
""But they are trying to do the best for the people in their care.""
With inflation currently running at 10% NASUWT, which represents Helen and Andrea, said the 5% pay offer would lead to ""more financial misery for hardworking teachers"".
National Education Union, also due to start balloting this week, said members had been ""undervalued for too long"".
School leaders represented by the National Association of Headteachers will also be asked whether they want to take industrial action for the first time in their history.
m was at breaking point because of the big reforms to education such as the new curriculum, combined with problems in recruiting and keeping staff and underfunding of schools.
Most unions are balloting members on the possibility of strike action as well as industrial action short of a strike which could mean sticking to contracted duties only.
riking would be a last resort. The last large scale strike action was in 2008.
Parent Andrew Couvret, from Cardiff, said he hoped the pay dispute was resolved soon.
""My daughter's 13 and with all the time they've had off with Covid I don't think it's the best time to be doing it.""
He said he appreciated the rising cost of living was having an impact ""but I don't think it's in the best interests of the children"".
mportance of teachers should be recognised, according to Amy Owen, also from Cardiff.
""In order for them to do their job properly and feel valued they need to be paid properly.""
ucation minister wrote to unions saying expecting pay to rise with inflation was ""perfectly reasonable"" but impossible without a big increase in the Welsh government budget.
""It is a disgrace the UK government has left us in such an impossible position,"" Mr Miles wrote.
In response, the Treasury said responsibility for funding public services was devolved.
""We have provided the Welsh government with a record £18bn per year for the next three years - the highest spending review settlement since devolution,"" a spokesman said.
Unions insist any pay offer should be fully-funded by government and not come out of individual school budgets.
It is not clear to what extent funding the pay offer will fall directly on schools rather than councils.
Mr Sibieta said ""school finances will be extremely tight"" with extra costs for pay on top of higher energy and food prices."	/news/uk-wales-63400434
politics	Scottish Tories 'very frustrated' by party leadership turmoil	"Scottish Tories are ""very frustrated"" by the UK party's leadership turmoil, according to their chairman.
Craig Hoy told BBC Scotland his colleagues want to focus on holding the SNP to account over independence.
Supporters of ex-PM Boris Johnson had been resolute that he would stand, until he announced on Sunday evening that he would not put his name forward.
Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt are now left in the race following Liz Truss's resignation.
Scotland's deputy first minister John Swinney said the Tories had fallen into disrepute as he called for a general election.
Liz Truss was forced to stand down after 45 days in office - the shortest premiership of any UK prime minister - as her policy programme spooked the financial markets.
race for the party's next leader has begun with a winner being declared on Friday.
According to our own BBC figures, which are being updated here, Mr Sunak has 153 Conservative MPs who have publicly given him their backing, while Ms Mordaunt has 25.
During an appearance on BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, Scottish Conservatives chairman Craig Hoy was pressed on whether his party could realistically lead a government in the wake of recent financial chaos.
It was put to him that other parties including Labour and the SNP have called for a general election.
He said: ""This is well within the constitution and within the rules and I think what the Scottish and British people now want us to do is to govern in their interest, which is to seriously tackle the issues we see in the economy. 
""And don't forget that many of these issues are global issues, which is why the distraction of events at Westminster has been very, very frustrating for us as Scottish Conservatives as well because we want to focus on holding the SNP to account.""
Asked to comment on whether the Scottish Conservatives could work with Mr Johnson if he were to become PM for a second time, Mr Hoy said ""we don't even know if he will throw his hat into the ring"".
He reiterated his position that it would be ""inappropriate"" for him to declare support for any candidate.
""I think we should be very cautious of hypothetical situations,"" he added.
""We will have this wrapped up by Friday so that we can start to focus on the people's priorities and that is making sure that we help households both here in Scotland and throughout the rest of the UK.""
Boris Johnson's final months in office were dogged by accusations he broke ministerial rules by not telling the truth about parties in Downing Street during the Covid lockdown.
He remains under investigation by the Parliamentary Standards Committee, which could lead to him being suspended from Parliament, or being kicked out as an MP.
John Swinney accused the Conservatives of treating the leadership race as their ""plaything"", a move he said had ""completely wrecked"" their reputation.
Reiterating his party's calls for a general election, Mr Swinney said: ""The Conservative Party has to realise itself that it's no longer fit to govern and that the people of this country must be given the chance to decide on the way we are governed moving forward.
""If we put enough pressure on them, then the Conservative Party has to realise the mistakes that they have made and be held to account.""
Mr Hoy argued that the country ""would be in a much deeper hole"" if it was to pursue independence according to the SNP's economy paper released on Monday.
Indy opponents and some economists including the Institute for Fiscal Studies have said the paper lacks detail on key issues.
However, Mr Swinney said Scotland was ""very finely balanced"" on the issue of independence.
He said further information would be set out in the coming weeks and months that would ""provide answers that people are looking for"".
uty first minister said: ""We've got a credibility of a government - and to be fair to governments of all political colours in Scotland - for 22 years of living within our resources. 
""That gives fiscal credibility to the Scottish government. Build that onto an independent central bank and that begins to build the financial credibility that is essential - and which has been squandered by the Conservative Party by its behaviour in recent weeks.""
Meanwhile, Shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray told The Sunday Show there must be a general election to end the Tory Party ""soap opera"".
He said: This isn't a game. People are struggling to pay their energy bills. They are making decisions about heating and eating, but can do neither. 
""The economy has been trashed, pensions have been trashed and yet we're in a situation today where it's like some EastEnders soap opera."" "	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63363803
politics	Living in Downing Street: Rishi Sunak and family move back in	"w prime minister and his family will be returning to live in the flat above No 10, Downing Street has said. 
Rishi Sunak, along with his wife and two daughters, stayed in the flat when he was chancellor to Boris Johnson.
Many PMs of recent years - especially those with children - have lived in the larger flat above No 11, officially designated for the chancellor. 
Asked why Mr Sunak has opted for No 10 instead, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""They were very happy there.""
residential areas inside Downing Street, are generally kept away from the public eye. But a few publicity shots from the past decades have offered glimpses into the décor behind the famous No 10 door. 
Speaking to the Times in August during the summer leadership contest Mr Sunak said the family would ""probably just move back into the flat where we used to live, to be honest"" if elected. 
""We have already decorated it and it's lovely.""
Meanwhile, several predecessors including Mr Johnson elected to live in No 11 because the four-bedroom flat there is much larger than the one above No 10. 
Blair and his wife Cherie and their family were the first to make the switch, swapping home with the then unmarried Gordon Brown. The Blairs turned the space into a family home. 
It was then extensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameron in 2011 at a cost of £30,000. 
Days before Theresa May was due to move in in 2016, the Sun reported she was eying up the No 11 flat that had been renovated by the Camerons.
A row about the interiors of Downing Street emerged more recently when Mr Johnson faced criticism over an expensive revamp of the No 11 flat - which led to the Conservative Party being fined £17,800.
rime minister receives an annual public grant of £30,000 to spend on living quarters. 
However the work for Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie, carried out by interior designer Lulu Lytle, cost more than £200,000. 
work was initially paid for by the Cabinet Office, but £52,000 was given to the Conservative Party by Tory donor Lord Brownlow to cover the bills. 
Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie wanted to transform the flat from previous PM Ms May's ""John Lewis furniture nightmare"" into a ""high society haven"", according to society magazine Tatler.
Mr Johnson said he had since covered the costs from his own pocket. 
Electoral Commission fined the Tory party and found it had failed to accurately declare all of Lord Brownlow's donations towards the renovation.
Asked whether Mr Sunak and his family will redecorate, the PM's press secretary said: ""Not that I'm aware of.""
In April, before Mr Sunak resigned as chancellor, his family moved out of Downing Street to their west London house to be closer to their children's school. 
me at a similar time as reports emerged that Mr Sunaks' wife, Akshata Murty had claimed ""non-dom"" tax status, reportedly saving her millions.
In his final few months as chancellor, Mr Sunak split his time between the family home and his official residence.
In the interview with the Times, Mr Sunak insisted the move from Downing Street in April was because his eldest daughter was in her last term of primary school and was meant to be able to walk to school by herself every day. 
No 10 Downing Street has been the residence of British prime ministers since 1735, says the government's website. It has three functions - the official residence of the PM, their office and where the prime minister entertains guests from world leaders to royalty. 
It is much larger than it appears from the front, with a warren of rooms and staircases spreading from the hall with the chequered floor immediately behind the front door. 
And another important resident of No 10 Downing Street is the cat, Larry, who has lived there since 2011 and has often caught the public's attention."	/news/uk-63404315
politics	Strep A: Antibiotics shortage in some Welsh pharmacies	"Demand for antibiotics used to treat suspected cases of Strep A has led to a shortage in some pharmacies in Wales. 
A seven-year-old girl from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, is among nine children to have died across the UK from invasive Group A Streptococcal disease (iGAS) since September. 
Pharmacist Ross Carpenter said there was ""a lot of worry"" among parents. 
Welsh government said it was working with the UK government to procure more antibiotics.
Health Minister Eluned Morgan said: ""We're confident that suppliers are working to address any supply issues and if people find difficulty obtaining a prescription locally, they may need to visit a different pharmacy.
""If they're still not able to then they can go back to the GP and they can prescribe an alternative treatment.""
Updated UK guidance on scarlet fever outbreaks (which are caused by Strep A) in October, says antibiotics can be used to help stop new cases of Strep A in settings such as schools but a decision should be taken with local outbreak control teams on ""a case-by-case basis"".
Mr Carpenter, who runs Resolven Pharmacy in Neath Port Talbot, said he had a ""sufficient"" but ""limited"" stock of antibiotics and there was difficulty getting hold of more. 
""Lots of people coming in asking questions, lots of phone calls from worried parents…. there's definitely an increase in demand of our time at the moment,"" he said. 
""I think you just have to be aware when they are going downhill, when they are looking dehydrated, when they've got a sustained temperature, looking out for the rash,"" added Mr Carpenter. 
""When normal measures of giving them say paracetamol and ibuprofen and they're just not responding, they're the times then we need to get them obviously to the GP then.""
One mum who was worried her child had caught Strep A said she had to call seven pharmacies before finding one that offered a test after being given ""incorrect information"" by 111.
Hazel Rocke, from Senghenydd, Caerphilly, said it ""upset"" her how difficult it was to find help for her nine-year-old daughter Ffion, who ended up having only mild tonsillitis. 
""We all worry about how we're going to find that help and the info we need... it's very concerning and also very frustrating,"" added Ms Rocke.
minister added that the number of strep A cases were ""fairly low"", but it was a worrying time for parents.  
Strep A can cause a range of illnesses. Most cases are mild: a sore throat or skin infection easily treated with antibiotics.
Some people develop scarlet fever, which causes a skin rash that feels like sandpaper, and flu-like symptoms including a high temperature.
Very rarely, strep A can cause invasive Group A streptococcal infection (iGAS), which can be deadly.
Invasive disease happens when the bacteria breaches the body's immune defences.
According to Public Health Wales about 20 children each year develop iGAS in Wales, but the majority will recover with treatment.  
Dr Jennifer Evans, a consultant paediatrician in Cardiff, advised parents to be ""vigilant"" and look out for danger signs, despite most children only suffering mild symptoms.
""If you are having trouble breathing, feel sleepy or irritable or have a baby under three months with a fever you need to see your GP much sooner,"" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. 
""There are a lot of viruses around at the moment so if your child responds well to paracetamol they should be able to carry on fine at home."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63879548

Ultimately, the prime minister is responsible for all government policy and decisions.
It's also their job to choose members of the government, known as ministers. 
most senior figures are called cabinet ministers. They lead government departments - such as the Treasury and Home Office.
rime minister can, at any time, hire and fire ministers. They can also abolish government departments or create new ones.
Alongside the chancellor, the prime minister is in charge of tax-and-spending policy. 
rime minister and their ministers can also bring in new laws - as long as they are backed by Parliament.
rime minister has overall control of the civil service - the people and departments that carry out government's decisions.

For example, they have the power to send the UK's armed forces into action. However, recent convention says Parliament should also approve such a move, where this is possible.
A number of special responsibilities also rest on the prime minister's shoulders, such as deciding whether to shoot down a hijacked or unidentified aircraft. They can also authorise the use of the UK's nuclear weapons.
Honours, such as knighthoods and damehoods, are put forward by the PM. They can also recommend peerages - where someone becomes a member of the House of Lords.

politics	River pollution: New phosphate rules hit thousands of planned new homes	"usands of new homes face being delayed or scrapped because of river pollution
f thousands of new homes face being delayed or scrapped because of river pollution that could cost the economy £16bn.
Experts say more phosphate, found in animal and human waste, is getting into rivers and affecting water quality.
ugher rules on phosphate river pollution targets have been brought in - but that could affect 100,000 new-build homes in England and Wales.
Developers want governments to take urgent action to find a solution.
ution is a problem partly caused by us and our demand for cheap food.
mand has driven an industry that's threatening to overwhelm our environment, a BBC investigation has found.
Campaigners have said more needs to be done to save the UK's rivers before it's too late.
uilding of more than 5,000 new homes are affected in Wales because of tighter phosphate pollution targets on rivers which were adopted in 2020. That could cost more than £700m to the economy.
Home Builders' Federation (HBF) contacted planning authorities and developers and calculated 100,000 homes in 74 areas in England are also affected by phosphate restrictions on housebuilding.
HBF estimate the impact could be a £16bn loss in economic activity in England and Wales.
figure is calculated from an industry standard model, factchecked by the BBC, that projects the financial footprint of new homebuyers, including spend in the local economy and taxes.
""We have government agency-imposed moratoriums on house building across large swathes of the country for nutrient neutrality, despite house building being a minor contributor to the issue,"" said Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the HBF.
""House building delivers growth, and it is crucial that the government re-evaluates the impacts of these costs and moratoriums and ensures that the industry is sufficiently supported such that it can deliver desperately needed new homes and the associated social and economic benefits.
""It is encouraging that after almost three years of home builders' pleas, the government seems to be looking to find solutions, but we need urgent actions that matches the scale and urgency of the issue.""
Natural England, a UK government agency, said phosphate pollution is causing ""serious damage"" to rivers and wetlands - and the species that live in them - and made £100,000 available for each affected river catchment.
""These are also the same habitats that we need to protect us from the impacts of the climate crisis such as drought,"" said Melanie Hughes of Natural England.
""Their protection and enhancement underpins our economy and our wellbeing.
""Nutrient Neutrality is a way of making sure that new housing does not add to the problem by ensuring developers can take action to reduce pollution, such as by making new wetlands.
""Together with the government, Natural England is working closely with local authorities, developers and planning authorities to create those solutions so that much needed development can take place. This is happening now.""
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford held a summit with farmers' representatives and water companies to discuss the impact of phosphate pollution on house building in the summer.
High levels of phosphate and other nutrients in rivers can lead to algal blooms and, ultimately, the loss of many species that make rivers their home, including fish, birds, invertebrates and plants that are vital to the river ecosystem. 
BBC Wales Investigates has explored the problem on the River Wye that straddles the England and Wales border. 
It is one of the UK's most ecologically diverse waterways and supports wildlife like salmon, otters and kingfishers.
River Wye catchment is failing Joint Nature Conservation Committee targets and Natural Resources Wales (NRW) estimates almost three-quarters of phosphates entering the river are from rural land use, like farming. 
""We cannot wait any longer,"" said Gail Davies-Walsh of charity Afonydd Cymru, which represents river trusts in Wales.
""Quite simply, if it carries on as it is now, that ecosystem will just collapse.
""It is salvageable, but it is going to take a huge amount of working together, and it's going to require all of those sectors to play their part in this and what we see at the moment is actually quite a lot of delays in that happening.""
Campaigners believe intensive poultry farming is responsible.
Data gathered by the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales has found that, since 2008, more than 300 intensive poultry farms and farm extensions have been given planning permission in Powys, which covers a large area of the Wye.
But water quality monitoring has not been able to prove a direct link between phosphates in the river and chicken farms.
""Agriculture is part of the problem,"" National Farming Union Cymru President Aled Jones told the BBC Wales Investigates programme.
""It's a very complex issue. There are so many other contributors to the water failing in these rivers. 
""We need to go with the evidence. And as that evidence is clarified, clearly, then we will respond.""
Water monitoring across the UK is limited but a team at Lancaster University modelled how much muck is being generated in the Wye catchment.
found 7,500 tonnes of phosphorus is generated in the River Wye catchment every year from animal muck. 
Crops in that area can only absorb around 4,500 tonnes of that muck - leaving a surplus.
""Fundamentally, if you have a surplus, you have too much phosphorus in your environment, it's likely that you're going to have worse water quality,"" said Dr Shane Rothwell of Lancaster University.
Near the Wye in Herefordshire, building has started on the first wetlands in the UK to be funded by developers buying what is being described as ""phosphate credits"".
Such measures aim to stop putting more nutrients, like phosphate, into rivers - similar to carbon offsetting.
wetlands in the village of Luston, near Leominster, should prevent 200kg of phosphate going into the river every year.
Developer Merry Albright has 52 house builds on hold due to the phosphate restrictions but is benefitting from the wetlands scheme.
She said: ""New housing didn't cause this problem and yet we are being blamed and also being asked to pay for a solution which won't really fix the bigger problem.
""I'm happy to do the best for the environment so I'm not seeking someone to eradicate the red tape but I would like people to focus on what caused this and what is needed to be done to fix it.""
In England, Defra said they have tripled their workforce in the last two years and increased farm inspections from 300 to 1700 a year. They added they plan to expand to 4,000 inspections annually.
In Wales, it's NRW's job to enforce water quality regulations. They are negotiating with Welsh government to get extra funding to police the new pollution rules.
""It is key having people on the ground to deliver,"" said Siân Williams of NRW.
""That's why we're looking into not just external funded programmes that are temporary, but we're also looking at our baseline funding with Welsh government.""
Wales' Rural Affairs Minister Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh Government had already been working to make ""quick gains"" as well as long term solutions.
""Of course, I'm part of the solution, just as other people are,"" she said. ""We all have to take responsibility each and every one of us."""	/news/uk-wales-63285821

A ballot saw 96% vote for strike action on a turnout of 71%.
It comes after Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, set a date of 24 November for its own strike.
SSTA officials said they are considering a strike for the week beginning 5 December.
rade union laws mean at least 14 days notice of a strike must be provided.
SSTA general secretary Seamus Searson said: ""The result is very good, we're pleased with the return that we got. It just shows the frustration of teachers.
""We've been trying to get this resolved since the beginning of the year. We haven't had a proper conversation about pay since August.""
Last week education secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said a teachers' strike was not inevitable.
She said: ""As a Scottish government, we're absolutely determined to see what we can do, to see if there's additional funding that we can provide to Cosla as the employers to provide an enhanced pay offer.
""I very much hope teachers would be able to look at that offer, take it to its members and we could not have industrial action.""
Deputy First Minister John Swinney previously said there was no more money to fund public sector pay rises.
Meanwhile, EIS teachers will stage a 24-hour walkout on 24 November after voting overwhelmingly to strike in a dispute over pay.

He was spotted in Wandsworth High Street on 4 April by Met Police officer PC Joseph Robson, who pulled him over.
In a written guilty plea, the Tonbridge and Malling MP said he was holding the phone but not using it and had later taken a driving course.
His case has been sent for a full hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court to consider disqualification.
Met had sent the MP a conditional offer of a fixed penalty notice and Mr Tugendhat agreed to pay the fine and surrender his licence, court papers showed.
ffence was sent to court because the politician already had six points on his record.
Bromley Magistrates' Court heard the case in private under the single justice procedure.
In his guilty plea, Mr Tugendhat wrote: ""I was holding my phone - not using it. After the incident I took a course to refresh and correct my driving.
""I accept my responsibility and recognise my culpability.""

""Thomas is a well-balanced driver and is interested in reaching his destination safely.""
Mr Tugendhat stood for Conservative Party leadership after Boris Johnson stepped down as prime minister. He became a minister in September.
In a statement, PC Robson said he had noticed a driver using a handheld device and said: ""I stopped the vehicle and spoke with the driver. I confirmed they weren't making emergency contact to the 999 service. I pointed out the offence where they confirmed the communication was using maps.""
A spokesman for Mr Tugendhat said: ""He apologises unreservedly and will accept the outcome of the case.""
It is understood Mr Tugendhat informed the Home Office permanent secretary about the offence after he became a minister.

politics	Rishi Sunak's migration plan raises big questions	"rime minister's immigration speech in the Commons comes three years after his party won a general election telling people a Conservative government would take control of immigration.
Just eight months ago, the government's flagship immigration bill promised ""to fix our broken asylum system"". 
Let's look at some of the key things Rishi Sunak has now promised to MPs - and the challenges he faces. 
rime minister says the UK's policing of the Channel has been ""too fragmented, with different people, doing different things, being pulled in different directions"".
He now plans a ""Small Boats Operational Command"" to bring together military and civilian teams, co-ordinating intelligence, interception, processing, and enforcement. The new command will use ""all available technology, including drones... and then prosecute more gang-led boat pilots"". 
All of this, however, is already being done in some shape or form - the UK has a dedicated commander of operations against small boats - so it's not clear yet what is changing.
government wants more prosecutions, but there are unprecedented delays in the courts so it's not clear when and how all these proposed extra cases could be heard. 
We've asked the Home Office to clarify over what time this target applies. One element of this strategy is to resume sharing immigration status data with banks, so they can deny people access to accounts. 
But the Windrush scandal revealed how people who were either British, or had a right to be in the UK, had their lives destroyed because the Home Office thought they were illegal immigrants - or had no record of their true status. They lost bank accounts, jobs and homes. The latest progress report on correcting the mistakes of Windrush warned the Home Office earlier this year this problem has still not been fixed. 
A Home Office spokesman said a ""range of safeguards"" had been introduced to the bank data-sharing process - including ""an improved customer contact and resolution service for those who feel they may have been incorrectly impacted.""
It's long been a mystery why the arrival of Albanians is such a problem for the Home Office. Ministers can sign an order that declares a particular country to be safe. Since 2003, Albania has been on that list of safe countries - and that should mean that anyone claiming asylum or protection can be quickly sent back there. 
government says Albanian crime gangs have been abusing the process under which people can claim protection as a modern-day slave, and it wants to close loopholes - but the evidence for that claimed abuse is disputed.
rime minister has admitted in Parliament that Germany, which takes in far more asylum seekers than the UK, rejects almost every Albanian applicant. 
Just supposing the government fast-tracks these cases - something Labour says it has long advocated - removing these people takes resources - and it's not remotely clear the Home Office has them. 
re are more than 100,000 people in the asylum support system waiting for decisions on their cases. About 37,000 are in hotels because the Home Office ran out of homes to put them in. It ran out of homes as its case backlog grew (see below). 
government, like Labour before it in the 2000s, has faced significant local opposition to moving asylum seekers into dedicated centres. 
A plan for one in North Yorkshire fell apart after both this summer's Tory leadership contenders refused to back it. Is that scheme and others now back on? 
Each centre will need planning permission - and that may mean more campaigns targeting MPs already worried about their seats. 
Mr Sunak says this new law would mean that people could be ""detained and swiftly returned"" to their home country or somewhere else - meaning, in theory, Rwanda or an EU destination. 
UN's refugee agency says the government's proposals would deny people access to the legal asylum system because of how they arrived. 
re is also speculation that the government wants to resurrect the ""Detained Fast Track"" - a Labour government scheme that was suspended in 2015 after critics won a legal battle to prove it was unfair. Supporters of DFT say it was valuable in weeding out unfounded claims quickly. 
By the way - the Rwanda scheme is still in the courts and there's no deal to send people back to the EU because ministers did not include it in the Brexit agreement. 
I've written extensively on how the backlog has rocketed since 2018. 
Part of the reason is that Home Office staff are taking longer and longer to deal with cases. 
Another is that since Brexit there has been a growing number of cases it officially won't deal with, so they remain in limbo. (A post-Brexit rule change declared that people coming from the EU could be blocked from making an asylum claim and sent back to the safe country they had come from - but, as said above, the UK has no returns agreement with the EU). 
ge is basically enormous. In 2004 Labour's PM Tony Blair set a far less ambitious target to complete more cases in a given period than new ones joined the pile. It took the Home Office two years to come close to hitting it. "	/news/uk-63965141
politics	I live rent free in Rishi Sunak's head, says Jeremy Corbyn	"Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has joked that he now ""lives rent free"" in Rishi Sunak's head because the prime minister mentions his name so often.
Mr Sunak has repeatedly attacked current Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer over his support for Mr Corbyn at the last general election.
In his latest jibe, at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak claimed Mr Corbyn had wanted to abolish the army.
Mr Corbyn accused the PM of creating a ""wholly inaccurate representation"".
Since Mr Sunak took over as prime minister last week, the Conservative Party has frequently linked Sir Keir to Mr Corbyn, despite Sir Keir expelling Mr Corbyn from the Parliamentary Labour Party in a long-running row over anti-Semitism.
In an email to Conservative supporters earlier this week, Mr Sunak said: ""Jeremy Corbyn might be gone, but Labour is still led by the man who tried to make Corbyn Prime Minister. And nothing has changed.""
At PMQs, Mr Sunak hit back at Sir Keir's claims his government had lost control of the asylum system, by saying: ""This is the person who, in 2019, told the BBC - I do think Jeremy Corbyn would make a great prime minister'. 
""Let us remember that national security agenda: abolishing our armed forces, scrapping the nuclear deterrent, withdrawing from NATO, voting against every single anti-terror law we tried, and befriending Hamas and Hezbollah. He may want to forget about it, but we will remind him of it every week, because it is the Conservative government who will keep this country safe.""
Mr Corbyn - who now sits as an independent MP - raised a point of order in the House of Commons on Thursday, accusing the PM of giving ""a wholly inaccurate representation of the 2019 election manifesto of which he must've been fully aware"". 
""If I am going to live rent free in his head at least he could accurately reflect what I think and what I say rather than inventions made up by him or his office."", he added. 
He also accused Mr Sunak of breaking the convention whereby MPs inform other MPs if they are going to mention them in the Commons. 
Rishi Sunak is questioned about the actions of his home secretary at his second session as prime minister.
Commons leader Penny Mordaunt said the former Labour leader should get used to being mentioned by the PM on a weekly basis.
She added that if he wanted to ""correct the record"" he could ""publish the manifesto that he stood on which would have weakened this country and dismantled Nato"".
Mr Corbyn hit back saying Labour's 2019 manifesto was ""freely available"" and added: ""If it had resulted in a Labour government we would not have such poverty, such food banks, such misery in this country today.""
Prior to becoming Labour leader Mr Corbyn had called for Nato to be disbanded however the party's 2019 manifesto promised to ""maintain our commitment"" to the organisation. 
It also supported the renewal of Britain's nuclear weapons system - despite Mr Corbyn's long-standing opposition to nuclear weapons - and pledged to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence to ""guarantee that our armed forces are versatile"". 
Sir Keir was shadow Brexit secretary under Mr Corbyn, who led the Labour Party to two general election defeats, in 2017 and 2019.
Mr Corbyn was suspended from the party in October 2020 over his reaction to a highly critical report about anti-Semitism in the party under his leadership."	/news/uk-politics-63503486
politics	Wales housing: Mother and baby in hotel due to shortage	"A mother and her newborn baby are among thousands of homeless people placed in temporary accommodation in Wales due to a lack of social housing.
Local authorities are having to put families in hotels that have no facilities to cook or wash clothes.
Ceri, from Gwynedd, spent four months in a hotel with her baby after registering homeless, as the local council had run out of social housing.
Welsh government said it was committed to ending homelessness.
Research by BBC Wales shows the number of people living in temporary accommodation has risen by more than 5,000 in two years.
In August 2020 there were 3,577 people in Wales living in temporary accommodation, but that figure jumped to 8,545 in August 2022, with 2,515 of them children.
Charity Shelter Cymru said families were ""living in limbo"", while a councillor said the situation was ""beyond a crisis"".
mporary accommodation is given by local authorities as a last resort to people who have no other housing options.
Ceri, who has asked for her surname not to be used to shield her identity, was housed in a hotel without any cooking facilities or a place to wash her clothes for four months as she waited for a home.
She has now been moved into a holding house as she waits for a permanent home to become available, but said she was left isolated in a rural location 20 miles (32km) away from her support network.
She has been waiting for 10 months, and said: ""I just want a home in an area that I've chosen, where I can hop 10 minutes on a bus to see friends and family - somewhere I can call home.""
Ceri registered as homeless in January, soon after having her first child, and with nowhere else to go she was housed in a hotel but said she did not expect to be living there for so long.
""We were in the process of weaning, there was no way to cook - there was just a kettle in the room,"" she explained.
""We had to go out, eat out for those three meals a day and that costed. Travelling to friends and family to cook tea for the baby, and then the issue of getting him settled - it was just really hard.""
Ceri said there were also booking issues and on more than one occasion she had to be moved to another hotel 25 miles (40km) away as the hotel where she was staying was full.
She has now been moved to a ""holding house"" in a rural part of Gwynedd, and while she said she was grateful she could now cook at home, she finds the lack of stability difficult.
""I really want to go back to work but I can't commit to getting a job around here as I could get a call tomorrow saying a house has been found in the area I've asked for which is miles away from here,"" she said. 
Ceri did not blame the local authority and said she was sympathetic to its struggles.
Her situation is becoming more common across Wales.
Wayne, 40, is currently living in a Travelodge in Pembroke Dock due to a shortage of temporary accommodation.
He arrived in Pembrokeshire from Cumbria in March after his relationship broke down during Covid, and said he spent three months sleeping rough.
Wayne initially slept in a tent because Pembrokeshire council does not currently have a night shelter and there is a waiting list for emergency accommodation in the county.
""It's hard, because you don't know where to turn, you don't know where to go. You don't know what to expect. You don't know who's going to make what decision, it's just a waiting game,"" he said.
A Pembrokeshire council spokesman said it had seen ""a significant increase"" in the numbers of households on the social housing waiting list in the past two years. 
It is currently putting up 161 households in temporary accommodation, including B&Bs and hostels.
kesman added: ""However, due to the reduction of properties in the private rental market, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find affordable and suitable accommodation in this sector.  
""The council has increased its temporary accommodation provision, but unfortunately due to both limited availability and cost it has been difficult to continue to meet the escalating demand for this accommodation.""
In Gwynedd, 247 people are living in temporary accommodation 
uncil's cabinet member for housing, Craig ab Iago, said he expected the situation to get worse due to a rise in the cost of living, a shortage of housing and the unstable future of Ukrainian refugees.
""This isn't right, it's immoral. We are the sixth richest country in the world,"" he said. 
""We're talking about millions of pounds more in housing people just in B&Bs... it's immoral... this is people's lives.""
Local authorities are responsible for housing people who present as homeless, but Mr ab Iago admits it puts massive financial strain on the council's budget. 
He called on the Welsh government to ramp up home-building efforts.
He described Ceri's situation as ""heart-breaking"", adding: ""We need to see a substantial investment.
""The word crisis is used often, so often actually I don't think it justifies the scale of the problem.
""It's beyond a crisis… and local authorities are pulling their hair our not knowing what to do - we need to find a solution or these numbers will just continue to rise.""
Shelter Cymru has also put emphasis on the rise in children in temporary accommodation, saying it has a massive impact on education and mental health.
Welsh government said: ""We are committed to ending homelessness and ensuring that any incidences are rare, brief and unrepeated.
""We do this by ensuring people are quickly supported into a suitable and stable home and, this year, we have provided local authorities with an additional £10m to support with the costs associated with providing temporary accommodation. 
""This is part of the £197m we are investing in homelessness and housing support services."""	/news/uk-wales-63416465
politics	Rishi Sunak defends return of Suella Braverman to Home Office	"Rishi Sunak has defended re-appointing Suella Braverman as home secretary days after she quit over data breaches.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the new PM of doing a ""grubby deal"" with Ms Braverman to secure her support in the recent Tory leadership contest.
He also asked if officials had raised concern over the appointment.
Mr Sunak avoided the question but argued bringing Ms Braverman back into cabinet brought ""experience and stability"" to government.
A No 10 spokesperson later denied reports that Simon Case - the head of the civil service - had been ""livid"" about the appointment. 
king his first Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak justified his decision telling MPs: ""The home secretary made an error of judgment but she recognised that, she raised the matter and she accepted her mistake.""
Starmer welcomes Sunak as the first British Asian prime minister, calling it a “significant moment""
He hit back at the Labour leader, accusing the party of being ""soft on crime and in favour of unlimited immigration"".
Sir Keir pointed to his own experience as head of the Crown Prosecution Service adding: ""I know first hand how important it is that we have a home secretary whose integrity and professionalism are beyond question.
""He's so weak, he's done a grubby deal trading national security because he was scared to lose another leadership election - there's a new Tory at the top but as always with them party first, country second.""
Liberal Democrats have also been critical of the appointment with the party's home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael saying: ""A home secretary who broke the rules is not fit for a Home Office which keeps the rules.""
SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the prime minister of doing ""a sleazy backroom deal to shore up his own position"".
Opposition parties are calling for investigations - the Liberal Democrats want an inquiry into Ms Braverman's appointment ""including any promises Sunak made to her behind closed doors"", while Labour wants one into possible security breaches by the home secretary.
Some Conservative MPs have also privately expressed their concern to the BBC about the decision.
During an urgent questions on the subject in Parliament, Labour MP Angela Eagle asked if an independent ethics adviser would investigate Ms Braverman's behaviour.
Cabinet Office minister Jeremy Quin replied that Mr Sunak did intend to appoint a new adviser - the previous holder of the role quit earlier this year - but added that ""events in the last administration would not be properly part of the remit of the new independent adviser"".
SNP's Ian Blackford says new PM Sunak did a ""sleazy backroom deal"" with Braverman to gain post
Ms Braverman stepped down last week amid the final days of Liz Truss's short-lived and chaotic premiership.
In her resignation letter, she admitted committing a ""technical infringement"" of the rules by sending an official document to someone not authorised to receive it. 
""I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility; I resign,"" she wrote.
Her letter also hinted at disagreements with Ms Truss over immigration policy expressing concern that the government was not delivering on commitments to tackle illegal migration. 
However, on his first day as prime minister Mr Sunak re-appointed Ms Braverman as home secretary.
It came three days after Ms Braverman had thrown her support behind him in the contest to replace Ms Truss, in what was widely seen as a significant endorsement by an influential MP on the right-wing of the Conservative party. 
Asked if Ms Braverman had been given the job as a reward for supporting the new PM, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC Mr Sunak had strong support from MPs in the contest adding: ""I doubt he needed any particular individual endorsement.""
What's behind Suella Braverman's comeback and what does it mean for policy?
It's clear what she wants to do in the job - in her resignation letter to Liz Truss she said she had ""serious concerns"" over whether the government was committed to reducing overall migration numbers and stopping illegal immigration. 
At the Tory conference she talked about her ""dream"" of making the Rwanda policy work and wanting to eventually get immigration levels down to the tens of thousands. 
Remember Liz Truss was poised to make an announcement on immigration policy as a way of trying to stimulate economic growth - something over which she was reportedly at loggerheads with Suella Braverman.
For Rishi Sunak, getting Suella Braverman's backing was a key moment in the truncated leadership campaign - and returning her to one of the great offices of states is an overture to the right of the party. 
He talked a lot about asylum seekers during the leadership contest over the summer - but less so about immigration, so we don't know much yet about his thinking. 
But it's interesting he's put one of his long-term allies - Robert Jenrick - in the Home Office as immigration minister.
Perhaps his eyes and ears in the department, someone to make alternative arguments or shape one whole policy area. 
One to watch. 
row over Ms Braverman's new job, came as MPs on the Home Affairs Committee heard evidence on Channel crossings.

Instead MPs heard from Dan O'Mahoney - the Home Office's clandestine Channel threat commander - who told the committee that 38,000 people have arrived in the UK so far this year in small boats - an increase compared to last year's figure of 28,526.
mmittee also heard that around 93% of people arriving in small boats this year have claimed asylum. However, there is a backlog in processing claims and only 4% of applications from 2021 have been processed. 
Mr O'Mahoney also noted there had been a huge increase in the number of Albanians arriving in the UK illegally - 21,000 in the UK this year, compared to 50 in 2020. "	/news/uk-politics-63397590
politics	Tory MP Mark Francois criticised for using 'outdated' racial slur	"Labour MP Sarah Owen asks the Speaker how to ""discourage"" the use of such phrases, as used by Mark Francois in the Commons
ry MP Mark Francois has been criticised for using an ""outdated"" racial slur in the House of Commons. 
Mr Francois said he meant ""no disrespect or offence"" when he referred to Japanese people as ""Japs"" in the chamber on Monday. 
Labour's Sarah Owen, the first MP of South-East Asian descent, said the ""crass racial slur has fallen well below the bar we should expect"". 
Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle urged MPs to choose their words ""carefully"". 
He added that he recognised ""the casual use of racial terms causes upset and should not be used"".
Mr Francois used the term during defence questions, saying: ""Given the defence budget is likely to come under great pressure, why does it take BAE Systems 11 years to build a ship the Japs can build in four?"" 
Neither Sir Lindsay nor Defence Secretary Ben Wallace condemned the use of the term, which has not been regularly used in the Commons since the 1940s, during the session. 
Raising a point of order the following day, Ms Owen, who has represented Luton North since 2019, said: ""Mr Speaker, you rightly and regularly remind us to use respectful language in this House, but unfortunately, this outdated and crass racial slur has fallen well below the bar we should expect.""
She added: ""Could you please advise me on how we can discourage all members of this House from using ethnic slurs such as this because progress is not inevitable, it is something that we must consistently and constantly strive for.""
In response, Sir Lindsay said the guide to parliamentary procedure states that ""good temper and moderation are the characteristics of the parliamentary language and [I] ask all members to remind themselves of that principle in choosing the words they use carefully.""
He added: ""People reflect also the language that we use - if we set the best of language, therefore others might follow."" 
In a statement, Mr Francois said: ""I meant absolutely no disrespect or offence to anyone by using the phrase 'Japs', during defence questions in the House of Commons yesterday. 
""I merely used it as an abbreviation for Japanese, as I had, by then, been asking an admittedly rather wordy question, about naval shipbuilding. 
""Moreover, in the course of that same question, as the record clearly shows, I actually complimented the Japanese shipbuilding industry, for building warships much faster than here in Britain."""	/news/uk-politics-63556238
politics	Can the UK-France crackdown on Channel smugglers work?	"French patrols often describe their mission as a game of cat-and-mouse, played against the clock, in the dark.
rthern French coastline offers a smorgasbord of hiding places for smugglers. Trees give good protection from surveillance planes, World War Two bunkers are ideal accommodation for passengers, and sand dunes and scrubland hide boats and slow patrols.
Equipment has helped. UK-funded drones, equipped with thermal-imaging cameras, have changed the game for gendarmes here, spotting people even under tree cover.
Specialist buggies built for sand dunes - another contribution from the UK - have helped units get there faster. But the last stretch to where a boat is being prepared for launch often must be covered on foot - through soft sand and thickets of thorny shrubs, sometimes chest-high.  
I've seen officers emerge from the chase with long deep scratches on their bodies - the thorns having torn through both uniform and flesh.
It's not hard to hear a patrol wading through that scrub. By the time gendarmes arrive, there's often just an abandoned boat and some petrol left behind. 
mugglers know what they're doing.
re is, the UK government says, no silver bullet.  But the resources ploughed into this coastline, year after year, are having some effect: 30,000 crossings attempts have been intercepted so far this year.  
And this latest deal contains two key messages about what's working - operationally and politically.
Firstly, there's more investment for equipment and patrols, with the goal of doubling the proportion of crossings that are intercepted.
And secondly, there's a new agreement that France will host British officers in command centres on French soil, to share information and help direct resources.
Sources close to the negotiations also tell me that France has also offered to allow British officers to come out on patrol with French unit as observers.
And Tony Smith, former Border Force director-general, believes it's a step in the right direction.
""We haven't had very much control in the past, about exactly how the French deploy the resources we're paying for,"" he told me. ""This new agreement means that we have now got operational and tactical liaison going on about deployments.""
UK has lobbied for years to have police on the ground here. 
When I asked the French Interior Minister last year about France's refusal of this request, he said it was an issue of sovereignty. Giving me a little smile, he added: ""Sovereignty is something the British understand.""
So this new concession by the French government could be read as a sign of slowly warming relations between Paris and London, after years of tension under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.
""I'm hearing that liaison with the French is much better now than it was,"" said Tony Smith. ""Now that Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman have reached out the olive branch to the French, that seems to have paid at least some dividends.""
""These observers could help [the UK] understand the difficulties we are in,"" said the Republican MP for Calais, Pierre Henri Dumont. ""We cannot have half our police officers on the French coast. We don't have the human resources. We're talking about human personnel, not just drones and cameras.""
Others here are more cynical. As one official at the Calais town hall privately suggested to me, including British police in the operation here - even as observers - makes it harder for those in the UK to continue pointing the finger of blame at France."	/news/world-europe-63628579

Sir Alok led the UK's efforts to secure a deal at last year's climate conference in Glasgow. 
Another former Conservative minister, Andrew Stephenson, is made a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire).
And there is an OBE for former sport minister Helen Grant, the Conservative MP for Maidstone and the Weald.
Sir Chris said he was ""very shocked"" by his knighthood.
""I have no idea how this comes about,"" he added. 
MP has represented the Rhondda constituency in Wales since 2001.
As chair of the Committee on Standards, he led the cross-party group of MPs who recommended suspending Conservative Owen Paterson from the House of Commons for 30 days after the MP was found to have breached lobbying rules.
government's botched effort to help Mr Paterson avoid the punishment is widely seen as the first in a string of scandals that eventually led to Mr Johnson's resignation. 
At the time Sir Chris was fiercely critical of the government, describing attempts to change the rules governing MPs' behaviour as ""the very definition of injustice"".
He also attacked the government over Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street, saying No 10 had become ""a cesspit, full of arrogant, entitled narcissists"". 
Sir Chris told PA News he was ""surprised"" to be receiving a knighthood and said it was an honour for the whole of the Committee on Standards.
""Everybody told me that the Standards Committee would be a quiet backwater,"" he said.
""It hasn't felt like that. I try, as does the whole committee, to set party allegiance to one side.
""Obviously the Owen Paterson moment threw a massive boulder in the middle of an icy pond but I hope the new code of conduct we agreed just before Christmas will set Parliament back on the straight and narrow.""
He added that he hoped the honour would help highlight his work on acquired brain injury.

Sir Julian has represented New Forest East in Hampshire since 1997 and during his time in Parliament has served as a shadow minister and chair of the defence committee.
He was kicked out of the Conservative parliamentary party in July 2020 after successfully standing against another Tory MP, Chris Grayling, to lead the Intelligence and Security Committee. 
Mr Grayling was believed to be Mr Johnson's preferred candidate but the other MPs, concerned the committee's independence could be undermined, voted for Sir Julian instead.
Sir Julian was re-admitted into the party six months later.
As committee chair, he published a long-anticipated report into Russian activity in the UK, which accused the government of ""badly"" underestimating the Russian threat. 
ur for Sir Tom Scholar comes just three months after he was fired as the top-ranking Treasury civil servant by Liz Truss. 
During her leadership campaign Ms Truss had been critical of the Treasury, saying it was not sufficiently focused on boosting growth.
Sir Tom's sacking was seen as proof of Ms Truss's determination to change what she called the ""Treasury orthodoxy"".

politics	SNP Westminster leader denies plotting to oust predecessor	"SNP's new Westminster leader has denied plotting to oust his predecessor Ian Blackford.
Stephen Flynn was elected group leader on Tuesday after Mr Blackford abruptly announced he was standing down.
Several MPs have since resigned from the SNP's front bench team, with Pete Wishart saying he was ""bemused"" about why Mr Flynn had sought a change.
But Mr Flynn, 34, told BBC Scotland that he only decided to stand for the job after Mr Blackford's resignation.
fact he had distanced himself from the role only two weeks earlier, saying he had ""no intention of standing"" amid rumours that he was ""on manoeuvres"".
Mr Blackford, a close ally of SNP leader and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, announced last week that he was standing down from the post he had held for five years - but will be staying on as MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber.
followed months of speculation about his future in the role, which included claims that Mr Flynn was seeking to replace him.
Mr Flynn then won a leadership vote against another ally of Ms Sturgeon, the Glasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss.
Allies of the new leader say he plans to set up a smaller front-bench team, which they say would allow other MPs to focus on constituency work and campaigning for independence.
And three prominent members of the front bench group have already stepped back, with defence spokesman Stewart McDonald and international development spokesman Chris Law joining Mr Wishart, who was its agriculture spokesman.
Mr Wishart was the most outspoken in his criticism, writing in his resignation letter to Mr Flynn that he was ""bemused as to the reasons why you felt it was necessary to seek a chance in our leadership"".
He also suggested that the new leader had been ""canvassing opinion for a leadership challenge"" prior to Mr Blackford's departure.
However, in an interview with BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, when asked if he had plotted to oust his predecessor, Mr Flynn said ""no, of course not"".
He said: ""Some folk have been watching a little bit too much House of Cards. There has been some very uninformed opinion in the public domain.
""Ian was very clear about this in his comments when he stepped down that now was the time for fresh leadership. I was quite keen to put myself forward, Alison did as well and I'm glad I received the backing of colleagues.""
When pressed about Mr Wishart's criticism, Mr Flynn said he wanted to keep the veteran MP ""on board"".
He said: ""Ian himself took the decision to stand down, and its for Ian to address any concerns Pete might have in relation to that. I can't speak for Ian in that regard.
""It was off the back of Ian's decision that I decided to put myself forward to be SNP group leader at Westminster.
""I am looking forward to us all coming together to really put pressure on the Tories and highlight the issues facing the people of Scotland in relation to the cost of living crisis, the damage being caused by Brexit, the complicity of the Labour Party in relation to that and of course the fact that Scotland has a democratic right to choose its own future.""
Mr Flynn described the three MPs who resigned as ""incredibly valued colleagues"", adding that he was putting together a ""dynamic set of folk"" to lead the party at Westminster.
He also pledged his loyalty to Ms Sturgeon, who he referred to as ""perhaps the most effective and efficient politician in the entire of Western Europe"".
He said: ""Ultimately we are SNP MPs, and that means we are not concerned about which bench we sit on in Westminster, be that a front bench or a back bench. 
""What we are interested in is making sure that Scottish MPs don't sit on those green benches, and that is our ultimate aim. When it comes to that myself and all of my colleagues will be at the forefront of that battle.""
Political opponents have accused the SNP of ""fighting like ferrets in a sack"", with the Scottish Conservatives claiming that ""the party's reputation for iron discipline"" was disintegrating.
But MP Stewart Hosie told BBC Scotland on Tuesday - the day before Mr Wishart quit - that talk of division was ""complete fiction"", saying he had ""no idea where these stories have come from"".
After Pete Wishart lifted the lid on the rows behind the scenes of the SNP's Westminster leadership change, Stephen Flynn has moved swiftly to clamp it back on.
At this point his insistence that nothing untoward has gone on and that everyone remains on the very best of terms has a hint of unreality about it.
But nowadays, political parties find themselves in such positions relatively frequently.
Plenty of rumours swirled around the Scottish Tory leadership change in 2020, when Jackson Carlaw disappeared in similarly sudden fashion and was smoothly replaced by Douglas Ross - who also denied talk of a ""stitch-up"".
So Mr Flynn is following a time-honoured approach by gritting his teeth and setting his sights on the horizon, in the hope he can slog through the questions until the story moves on.
Regardless of how either he or Ms Sturgeon feel about how things have played out, they will now feel compelled to put these rows behind them and aim to forge a united front in the campaign for independence."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63922302

politics	Rishi Sunak could still attend COP27 climate summit	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak could still attend the COP27 climate summit if sufficient progress is made on preparations for the autumn Budget, Downing Street has said. 
On Thursday No 10 said Mr Sunak was not expected to attend ""due to other pressing domestic commitments"". 
But on Monday the prime minister's official spokesman said this position was ""under review"". 
Alok Sharma, the UK's COP26 president, is among those saying the PM should go.
UK is the current holder of the COP presidency, after hosting the summit in Glasgow last year. 
ual UN climate summits are designed to help governments agree steps to limit global temperature rises.
Mr Sharma will hand over the presidency to Egypt at the COP27 summit in Sharm el-Sheik, which takes place from 6 to 18 November. 
ference finishes the day after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is due to set out the UK's tax and spending plans in his highly anticipated autumn statement. 
On Monday, Mr Sunak's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister is focused on pressing domestic issues, most significantly preparing for the autumn statement, so any attendance at Cop would depend on progress on preparation for that fiscal event, and that work is ongoing.""
""The prime minister fully recognises the importance of the COP summit and is fully committed to addressing climate change,"" he added. 
Asked on BBC Breakfast whether the prime minister could attend, Environment Minister Mark Spencer said Mr Sunak had ""a huge inbox"", with challenges including the economy and rising global energy and food prices. 
""His focus at the moment is dealing with the autumn statement and the government's response to those global challenges,"" he said. 
Mr Spencer added: ""I'm sure if his diary allows he would want to go but at this moment in time don't quite know if he's going to be have time to do that.""
Mr Sunak has faced criticism from opposition parties, environmental groups and some Conservatives, after No 10 said he was not expected to attend the summit. 
Liberal Democrat climate spokeswoman Wera Hobhouse called for Mr Sunak to ""immediately confirm his attendance"", adding: ""It shouldn't take Boris Johnson going to COP to embarrass Rishi Sunak into doing the right thing.""
re are reports Mr Johnson, who attended the Glasgow summit when he was prime minister, could go to Egypt for this year's event.
Labour have accused Mr Sunak of a ""failure of leadership"" and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said it was ""absolutely so wrong"" that Mr Sunak was not going, as the UK is still COP president, adding: ""Symbols matter.""
At the weekend Alok Sharma, who was recently demoted from cabinet, told the Sunday Times he was ""pretty disappointed"" at news Mr Sunak was not going, saying his attendance would signal the UK's ""renewed commitment on this issue"".
On Monday, the government's most senior environmental advisers, including influential climate experts Lord Stern and Laurence Tubiana, urged Mr Sunak to attend the conference, saying it presented ""an opportunity... to restore the trust and confidence of the international community in Global Britain"". 
US President Joe Biden, France's Emmanuel Macron and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon are all due to attend, while Mr Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss had been set to go when she was PM. 
King Charles, who is a longstanding champion of environmental issues, will not attend after Buckingham Palace sought advice from then-PM Ms Truss and agreed he would not go in person. The advice has not changed under new PM Mr Sunak.
However, the monarch will host a reception at Buckingham Palace on 4 November, on the eve of the conference, for 200 international business leaders, decision makers and charities to mark the end of the UK's COP presidency and look ahead to the summit in Egypt. 
Mr Sunak will ""say a few words"" at the event, which will also be attended by US climate envoy John Kerry. 
ge climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has said she will not be at the summit in Egypt, called it a ""scam"" and said it was ""symbolic"" the conference was being held in a country which ""violates many basic human rights"". 
""Many world leaders are too busy to go there because they have their own problems. With that mindset we're not going to be able to solve many of the problems that we face,"" she told an event in London on Sunday. 
Egypt conference is expected to focus on three main areas - reducing emissions, helping countries prepare for and deal with climate change, and securing technical support for developing countries for these activities."	/news/uk-politics-63454966
politics	Rishi Sunak urges Russia to 'get out' of Ukraine at G20	"Rishi Sunak has urged Russia to ""get out of Ukraine,"" as he condemned its ""barbaric"" invasion at the G20 summit of world leaders.
At a meeting attended by Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, the British PM said the UK would ""back Ukraine for as long as it takes"".
Mr Sunak criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin for not turning up to the summit held in Indonesia.
""Maybe if he had, we could get on with sorting things out,"" he added.
Mr Sunak is attending the summit for the first time as UK prime minister, after replacing former Conservative leader Liz Truss last month.
war in Ukraine is set to dominate the conference of major world economies, taking place in the Indonesian island of Bali this week.
Speaking at a closed-door session for world leaders, Mr Sunak blamed the conflict in Ukraine for worsening economic conditions globally. 
He said Russia's ""weaponisation"" of energy and food exports was harming the world's poorest.
He added that ""countries should not invade their neighbours"", accusing Russia of undermining ""fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity"". 
""It is notable that Putin didn't feel able to join us here. Maybe if he had, we could get on with sorting things out,"" he added.
""The single biggest difference that anyone could make is for Russia to get out of Ukraine and end this barbaric war.""
Mr Lavrov is representing Russia - a G20 member - at the summit after Moscow said President Putin would not be attending. 
In a video speech earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged leaders to extend a UN-backed grain export deal due to expire on Saturday.
greement, struck in July, saw Moscow agree to allow ships to export millions of tonnes of grain and other foodstuffs from Ukraine through a safe corridor in the Black Sea.
Russia said on Saturday that there had yet to be any agreement to extend the deal.
In return for allowing Ukraine to ship out food, it has insisted the West lifts sanctions on a state-run agricultural bank, which it argues has effectively blocked Russian food and fertiliser exports.
Meanwhile, Mr Sunak has said China poses a ""systemic challenge"" to the UK.
His predecessor Ms Truss was reportedly planning to designate the country a ""threat"" to the UK as part of a foreign policy review. 
Asked whether he would do the same, Mr Sunak told reporters: ""I think that China unequivocally poses a systemic threat - well, a systemic challenge - to our values and our interests and is undoubtedly the biggest state-based threat to our economic security.
""But I also think that China is an indisputable fact of the global economy and we're not going to be able to resolve shared global challenges like climate change, or public health, or indeed actually dealing with Russia and Ukraine, without having a dialogue with them."""	/news/uk-politics-63633651
politics	Budget fears voiced as Scottish prison energy bills soar	"Scottish Prison Service's gas and electricity bills have rocketed by 47% as it faces the threat of budget cuts.
rvice says the cost of providing food for prisoners has risen by almost 17% and could increase by up to 30%.
However, the Scottish government is proposing that the budget for the criminal justice system will remain flat over the next four years.
rison service's chief executive Teresa Medhurst said it was already under pressure due to inflation.
She warned the service had ""no or very limited scope"" for making savings.
Ms Medhurst has told the Scottish Parliament's criminal justice committee that a budget freeze could threaten its operational stability and leave it open to challenges under human rights legislation.
She also warned that essential rehabilitative regimes could be lost and health and welfare support put at risk.
Ms Medhurst said the 47% increase in gas and electricity prices - which are expected to reach £15m in the current financial year - had ""created a significant pressure"" on the SPS budget.
She added that the cost of food for prisoners was already a ""key cost pressure"", and that over the next six months the annual inflation could reach 30%. Food costs are expected to be £7.4m in 2022/23.
In a resource spending review published in May, the Scottish government proposed a flat cash settlement for the criminal justice system until March 2027.
Ms Medhurt's concerns over this proposal have been echoed by His Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland, Wendy Sinclair-Gieben.
Speaking during a visit to HMP Shotts in Lanarkshire, she said: ""I'm very concerned about it. 
""This is a service that provides containment for the most dangerous and the most vulnerable in society for Scotland.
""To have a flat cash settlement will have a massive impact on how they cope with that.""
Scottish Prison Service operates 13 prisons and two community custody units for women, with 4,500 staff and about 7,500 inmates.
HMP Shotts is the national facility for long-term prisoners. Of the 540 men behind its bars, 240 are serving life sentences.
Its governor, William Stuart, said the jail's food and utility bills had increased significantly. The service is also facing demands for increased wages.
He said: ""It is going to make it much more difficult in the future to operate the way we do right now, so we may have to make decisions about doing things differently from what we're doing today.""
He said this could result in fewer opportunities for prisoners.
""We may not be able to provide the full range of activities and regime we have just now,"" he said.
""We may have to look at our staffing profile, which in my opinion would make the prison more unsafe. I would be worried about the safety of our staff and the safety of those we look after.""
riminal justice committee at the Scottish Parliament is due to hear evidence on Wednesday from officials from the prison service, courts service and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.
xpressed concern about the flat cash settlement proposed in the spending review.
urts service and Crown Office say budget cuts will hamper their efforts to address the backlog of cases caused by the pandemic and could halt the development of new initiatives to deal with sexual offences.
In response, the Scottish government said that the review published in May lays out ""high level resource spending plans"" and is not a budget.
It called on the UK government to use its financial and economic powers to provide support for public services ""in these difficult times"".
UK government has said it provided Holyrood with a record £41bn per year for the next three years, ""the highest spending review settlement since devolution"".
A spokesman said: ""The Scottish government is receiving around £126 per person for every £100 per person of equivalent UK government spending in England over the next three years.""
mments came as the chief inspector of prisons published a report on HMP Shotts.
It said the facility was safe and well run but faced challenges because of a shortage of NHS staff to provide medical care.
Ms Sinclair-Gieben said the prison's ""confidence"" had been affected by a period of significant incidents earlier this year, but the national introduction of photocopying of prisoner mail had led to ""a welcome reduction in drug related incidents""."	/news/uk-scotland-63477649

politics	Bereaved parents' childcare petition to be debated by MPs	"""It feels like we have an army of people behind us"" - Bereaved parents' childcare petition to be debated
rents of a boy who died after choking on food at his nursery are calling on the government not to increase the number of children that staff are allowed to look after.
Zoe and Lewis Steeper's petition on the issue will be debated by MPs on Monday, after it passed 100,000 signatures. 
Ministers are considering increasing how many two-year-olds a staff member in England can supervise at any time.
m is to reduce costs for parents and give nurseries more flexibility.
government is expected to set out its response to a consultation on the proposals, which ran between July and September, soon. 
It asked the public and people working in the sector whether they thought the current minimum staff-to-child ratios for two-year-olds in England should be changed from 1:4 to 1:5, as is the case in Scotland. 
was raised under Boris Johnson's government earlier this year to help tackle the rising cost of living. 
reports emerged just months after the death of Oliver Steeper, who died in hospital in September last year, after he choked on food at his nursery in Ashford, Kent.
""After losing Oliver in a childcare setting, when this came about, we just thought we can't allow another set of parents to go through what we're living,"" Lewis told the BBC. 
family cannot comment on the specifics of Oliver's case as a police investigation is ongoing.
However, they decided to launch their petition because they were concerned that increasing the number of toddlers staff can look after could put children at risk. 
""It's not physically possible to keep as good an eye on five children as it is on four,"" Zoe said. 
""To have more children under your care, knowing that they are literally the most precious thing that a parent can give to you, I can't imagine that sense of responsibility.""
rents also argue that changing ratios would add to the pressure on staff. 
""They're already overstretched, underpaid, and overworked as it is,"" Lewis said.
Steepers said they had mixed emotions when the petition passed 100,000 signatures as it happened on the first anniversary of Oliver's death. 
""We both let out this scream of joy that it may now be selected for a debate,"" Lewis said. 
""To get that on that day was so poignant. We both had a little cry afterwards.""
Early Years Alliance, which represents the sector in England, is supporting the petition. 
Chief executive Neil Leitch said changing ratios was not in the best interests of children or staff and now would be ""the worst possible time"" to do so. 
He said the sector was in ""a recruitment and retention crisis"" and increasing the workload of staff would push more to leave the industry. 
Mr Leitch said research suggested the proposed changes to ratios would not reduce costs for parents. 
A survey carried out by the group in May of 5,800 early nurseries and pre-schools in England found just 2% said relaxing childcare ratios would result in them lowering fees for parents. 
Around nine in 10 were opposed to the government proposals to relax ratios and only 13% said they would regularly or permanently use the new ratio if it changed.
Jacqui Hannaby, who manages Granby Nursery in Worksop, said she would stick to the current ratios, even if the government changed the rules, to look after the wellbeing of her staff. 
""We can't recruit - people are leaving left, right and centre,"" she said. ""Increasing the ratios is only going to add stress to overworked staff.""
Even if she did allow her staff to look after more children, Ms Hannaby said she would not be able to decrease fees or enrol more children because the size of her site limited the numbers she could take. 
She added that following the pandemic, many children were coming to her nursery with speech and language or attachment issues after being born during lockdown and needed more attention not less. 
Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said: ""The evidence is clear: reducing childcare staff ratios will not reduce costs but will reduce standards of early years education and could put children at risk.""
A Department for Education spokeswoman said ""our deepest sympathies are with Oliver Steeper's family"" and ""the welfare and safety of children remains a priority"". 
She said proposals to increase the number of children staff can look after aimed ""to give providers more flexibility in how they run their businesses while maintaining safety and quality of care"". 
""We continue to explore options to improve the availability and affordability of childcare - no decisions have been taken,"" the spokeswoman added. "	/news/uk-politics-63489271
politics	Nicola Sturgeon urges leaders to deliver on climate vows at COP27	"Nicola Sturgeon is urging world leaders to deliver on climate pledges made in Glasgow last year as she attends COP27.
first minister is calling on more developed nations to make good on commitments made at COP26 in Scotland, including reducing coal usage and financing the shift to net zero.
r's climate summit is being held at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. 
It came as the Scottish government was accused of ""rank hypocrisy"" following cuts to its energy efficiency budget.
Ms Sturgeon is set to take part in an all-female panel discussion on financing decarbonisation with government leaders, including the prime minister of Barbados.
She will also meet representatives from countries in the global south – a term applied to developing nations in South America, Africa, Asia and Oceania – to hear their experiences of the climate crisis and what they want to be delivered at the climate talks.
Ahead of the summit, the UN published a report that said there was ""no credible pathway"" to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C by the end of the century.
Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, the first minister said there was more of a sense of ""nervousness and scepticism"" in Egypt than there was at COP26.
She said; ""I think Glasgow was a success - we didn't get everything that had been hoped for but I think the feeling coming out of COP26 was that it was a good foundation to build on. But it will only count if it is implemented.
""This COP is all about implementation - what happens here is absolutely crucial now to our chances of keeping 1.5 alive, and to be blunt about it, saving the planet for generations to come.""
At last year's COP, Scotland became the first developed nation to commit to finance that addresses loss and damage.
Scottish government pledged £2m from the Climate Justice Fund to fund the project. 
Other countries such as Denmark have followed suit, though some nations are reluctant as it could lead to unlimited compensation claims through the courts.
Now the subject of loss and damage has been added to the official COP27 agenda for the first time, something Ms Sturgeon called a ""big, big step"".
She said: ""Governments like Scotland and the state governments of United States, regions lined across Germany for example, hold a lot of power here so it's really important that we don't shy away from that and use that power and live up to our responsibilities. 
""Certainly the action the Scottish government took at the outset of COP26 has given a real momentum boost to the issue of loss and damage and you'll hear plenty people that are not associated with the Scottish government say that. 
""It's arguable that it wouldn't be on the agenda this year had we not put such a focus on it in Glasgow. But that's a first step, it's really important we keep that momentum going.""
At COP26 the first minister said it was ""highly likely"" that the Scottish government would associate itself with the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance.
She told the BBC that there would be an update on this in a new energy strategy to go before cabinet by the end of the year, adding she was ""absolutely not"" bowing to pressure from the fossil fuel industry not to join.
However, Scottish ministers have been criticised for cutting funding for green policies ahead of COP27.
utumn budget revision, which was announced by Deputy First Minister John Swinney, revealed almost £133m will be axed from the government's energy efficiency schemes.
Some £109.9m is being removed from the operating budget, while £23m will be lost from the capital budget, the documents show.
mes aim to improve the efficiency of public buildings and help people insulate their homes.
Scottish Labour said the decision was ""shameful"" as Ms Sturgeon headed to Sharm El-Sheikh.
rty's net zero and energy spokesman, Craig Smyth, urged the government to reverse the cuts amid the cost-of-living crisis.
He said: ""A year ago, Nicola Sturgeon promised to make Scotland a world leader in the green revolution, but these empty promises are in tatters.
""The cost-of-living crisis and the climate emergency are two of the urgent challenges our country faces, but the SNP-Green government are gutting support schemes.
""Making these damaging cuts as COP27 gets under way lays bare the rank hypocrisy hiding behind this government's environmental rhetoric, as well as their failure to use the powers they have to help with the cost-of-living crisis.""
f the government budget cuts is almost £1.2bn when added to previously announced reductions of £560m as ministers grapple with tough financial pressures.
Mr Swinney said last week: ""I must balance the books, but I am committed to doing so in a way that prioritises funding to help families, to back business, to provide fair pay awards and to protect the delivery of public services."""	/news/uk-scotland-63536242
politics	Holyrood’s budget watchdog growls	"underspend by £1bn is unfortunate. To do so by £2bn looks like carelessness.
Or so Oscar Wilde might have said if he were commenting on the Scottish government's accounts for last year.
But this wasn't his dramatic dialogue to write. The auditor general was commenting, however, and Stephen Boyle's assessment of the underspend on a £51bn budget was not as harsh as some of the government's critics.
About 40% of that was due to money allocated to student loans but not drawn down.
A large share of it was due to funds being allocated but not spent on business support grants to help them through Covid, or those grants you could get if financially losing out due to self-isolation. The total budget for handling the pandemic last year came to £5.8bn.
It's perverse to criticise government for not paying out money that wasn't needed. At worst, it was a failure of budget planning rather than budget spending.
financial year 2020-21 was a second exceptional period of extra funds pouring into the budget to tackle the pandemic, and some fast manoeuvring to spend it effectively.
uditor general had other issues in his sights, with his comment on the accounts which were published on Thursday. And he highlighted some startling figures where policy had gone badly wrong.
Remember that spat with the European Commission, which began in 2019, with the Scottish government accused of failing to fit with the rules for spending the European Social Fund?
It reached the point where the Scottish government gave up trying to defend its position. So it has written off £43m.
Remember the civil case of malicious prosecution brought against the Crown Office for its handling of the controversial administration of Rangers football club? That has so far cost the government £60m.
's right. Sixty million pounds. It won't take you long to think how that might have been better spent.
Scottish government now controls some welfare benefits, most of which are administered through Whitehall's Department of Work and Pensions. An estimate of overpayments of these devolved benefits comes to £67.5m. 
re is no estimate of the overpayment of welfare benefits by the new Social Security Scotland agency. Mr Boyle says there should be, as administration is transferred.
re are those investments the Scottish government made in trying to shore up troubled firms deemed to be of strategic significance.
Prestwick Airport is of strategic significance, at least as a fuelling stop for military flights between the US and points east of here. It was taken over by the Scottish government nine years ago, and for several years turned in sizeable losses.
While not much of a passenger airport, it's turning a modest profit these days. But the accounts show that the cost of keeping it open has passed the £50m mark, including £7m of interest on loans that will never be repaid.
re was the controversial deal in 2016 with Sanjeev Gupta's complex web of companies that took over steel and aluminium works in Scotland.  The 25-year agreement to guarantee payments for production of energy from the Lochaber hydro scheme that feeds the aluminium smelter near Fort William carries a very high potential cost.
means a provision of £114m is made in the accounts. The potential cost per year is up to £32m.
re was the loss on the BiFab fabrication plant in Fife, which meant a £37m write-off in previous years' accounts. And there was the notorious cost of the Cal-Mac ferries being built in the government-owned Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow.
During the 2021-22 financial year, the government wrote off a further £52m to keep the yard open and to help get the ships finished. The total cost is heading north of £250m, when the original contract was for £97m. By last March, the two ships were valued at only £78m.
In comments on previous accounts, Stephen Boyle told the Scottish government that it needed a framework with which to judge the risk tolerance and risk appetite in taking on such companies, particularly because of the lack of flexibility in the budget.
Such guidelines have been drawn up. The auditor general would like them to be clearer about risk, and to have less flexibility for ministers to get round them.
His main concerns are of the type that auditors can be expected to care about more than most, but they matter for all of us, as government budgets head into some very tight squeezes.
unts that are published don't cover the Scottish government's agencies. They're not clear about some of its liabilities, including those companies it has taken over.
So Mr Boyle is particularly keen to see comprehensive whole-of-government accounts. These were promised in 2016, but six years later, they still have not been produced.
He wants to see more transparency in capital borrowing and in the way the Scottish government flexes its finances. He is not the only one to notice how extra millions can be found down the back of the St Andrew's House sofa, and he wants MSPs, in scrutinising budgets, to be given a better idea of how that is done.
uditor general is calling for a comprehensive workforce plan, warning that tight budgets can take a mental health toll on civil servants.
And he is concerned about the governance of government. There's been change at the top, but he warns of unnecessary duplication and inefficiency in handling decision-making.
Much of this is going to become all the more relevant in less than two weeks when John Swinney, as acting finance secretary, sets out his draft budget for the next financial year.
And in emphasising the need for a fuller picture of the whole of government's spending, risks and liabilities, Stephen Boyle doesn't hold back in arguing that the need for it has never been greater:
""The consequences of the pandemic, challenging global economic conditions, the cost of living crisis together with existing pressures in public services all pose significant risks to the sustainability of Scotland's public finances,"" says his report.
A fuller set of accounts will be ""important for decision-making over the longer term as it will provide information about the impact of past decisions on future budgets, the potential risk to financial sustainability, the scale of assets and liabilities and the opportunity to re-think how public finances are managed as the Scottish government seeks to deliver public service reform"".
It's worth dwelling a while over the words ""the opportunity to re-think how public finances are managed"".
In response to the audit report, Mr Swinney emphasised the careful management required to avoid an overspend, the upheaval of the pandemic and ""an extremely challenging time for the public sector"".
uty first minister also pointed to the auditor general's recognition of a strengthened focus on longer-term financial planning.
""The Scottish government is committed to producing additional accounts and the auditor general's report recognises the steps we have taken,"" Mr Swinney said.
""Progress has been slower than planned as we prioritised work on tackling the current exceptional financial challenges.""
So the Scottish government says it is committed to improved transparency. Its watchdog wants to see that made clear."	/news/uk-scotland-63831950
politics	Tory MPs urge PM to change law to ease migrant crisis	"More than 50 Tory MPs have urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to alter ""quirks"" in modern slavery laws to make it easier to send some migrants home.
r, arranged by former Brexit Secretary David Davis, demands those travelling from ""safe countries"", such as Albania, be returned more quickly.
MPs maintain a ""simple"" change in the law could ease the current crisis. 
A Home Office source said Home Secretary Suella Braverman was ""working flat out"" to solve the issue.
urce said Ms Braverman and Mr Sunak were working ""to bring in reforms to help stem the flow of migrants across the Channel"".
More than 40,000 people have crossed in small boats from France so far this year.
In the letter, Tories describe the crossings as a ""Gordian Knot that needs cutting with a simple policy"".
gnatories argue that a provision in current law prevents the government from returning a person who says they are a victim of modern slavery to their original home.
""If they have really been taken against their will, then they could not reasonably object to being returned to their own homes,"" the letter said.
""The quirks in our modern slavery laws that prevent this are clearly in defiance of the aims of that law and should be removed.""
MPs, including former cabinet ministers Dr Liam Fox and Esther McVey, and veteran backbenchers Sir Peter Bottomley and Sir Graham Brady, are among the 50-strong body of Conservative politicians calling for the change.
rgue this ""straightforward and legally workable way of addressing the crisis"" would be a ""very strong deterrent"" to those who might be planning to make the trip across the Channel.
Mr Davis said the number of people from safe countries like Albania claiming asylum in the UK was ""paralysing the whole system"". 
""I want to protect the asylum system for people who really need it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 
rge majority of migrants claim asylum on arrival in the UK and many are housed in hotels while awaiting the outcome of their applications, which are often subject to delay.
Speaking last week, Ms Braverman admitted the UK government has failed to control its borders, blaming migrants and people smugglers for recent chaos at Kent's Manston processing centre.
usands of migrants were placed in tents at the centre during the autumn months, leading to overcrowding and outbreaks of disease. 
Everyone staying at the temporary site has since been placed in alternative accommodation, according to the Home Office.
Last month, MPs from the Home Affairs Committee heard how the UK was spending about £7m a day on hotels to house asylum seekers.
A government spokeswoman said: ""We have made clear that there is no one single solution to stop the increase in dangerous crossings.
""We have also made clear that we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to deter illegal migration.
""We are expediting the removal of individuals by agreeing tailored bilateral returns agreements with partners like Albania, elevating it to a key priority for our foreign policy."""	/news/uk-63775337

Wales' first minister has told a newspaper he immediately regretted losing his temper in a Senedd row that went viral on social media.
Mark Drakeford erupted in anger following a questions from the Tories' Andrew RT Davies about ambulance response times.
Speaking to the i, he said he left the debating chamber ""thinking this is not a good look"".
But added that his comments about the Conservatives did ""strike a chord"".
Mr Drakeford had accused the Conservatives, then led by Liz Truss, of making a mess of the UK's reputation.
Angrily flipping the pages of his briefing notes, he told Mr Davies: ""You think you can turn up here this afternoon and claim some sort of moral high ground? 
""What sort of world do you belong in?""
Nicola Sturgeon was among those that praised Mr Drakeford's response.
But the comments earned criticism from the daughter of a man whose long ambulance wait had been raised by Mr Davies.
Keith Morris, 79, from Merthyr, was left in pain on the floor for 15 hours.
His daughter Angela Morris Nicholas said she was ""angry and upset"" at the first minister's outburst.
Mr Drakeford told the newspaper: ""I was cross with myself. You should not lose your temper, you should not allow yourself to be provoked. 
""I left the chamber angry at myself. 
""I was thinking this is not a good look for how we conduct politics in Wales but by the time I got home people were saying, 'Thank goodness you said it, it was about time' It did strike a chord.""
He said he did not ""deny there are people who don't get the service they deserve"".
""But to call the Welsh NHS a Third-World service was just such an insult to people who work so hard in it that I just couldn't react to it in my generally calm way.""
Liz Truss failed to make contact with the first minister during her short 49-day tenure as prime minister. 
Rishi Sunak spoke to Mr Drakeford on his first day in the job.
Mr Drakeford said her only words to her were ""hello Mark"" during  a memorial service for the Queen.
""That's the full script, verbatim,"" he said."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63475451
politics	Ed Davey: Avanti has been a disgrace, says Lib Dem leader	"rformance of rail company Avanti West Coast ""has been a disgrace"", the leader of the Liberal Democrats said as he urged the government to tackle poor public transport.
Ed Davey told Politics Midlands the delays and cancellations were harming both people's lives and the economy.
Steve Montgomery, managing director of First Rail, has apologised to customers and promised things would improve.
A backlog of driver training during the pandemic was to blame, he said. 
Passengers have been enduring a prolonged period of disruption on the rail network, with Avanti slashing its timetables in August, with trains between London and Manchester the worst affected.
""The performance of Avanti has been a disgrace, and frankly, people have acted far too slowly. They've just not delivered for people,"" Mr Davey said.
""It's not just damaging the lives of people because they have these appalling delays, cancellations and poor journeys. It's hampering the economy.""
Mr Montgomery told the BBC this week Avanti had ""more than enough drivers"", but needed to catch up on their training after the pandemic. It takes 12 to 18 months for a driver to qualify.
Avanti said drivers suddenly stopped volunteering for overtime in the summer, prompting it to cut its timetable to reduce cancellations.
At the time, the drivers' union Aslef denied accusations of unofficial strike action but admitted there had been a loss of goodwill.
Avanti has promised a full timetable in December that does not rely on rest day working.
Last month, the Department for Transport warned that Avanti West Coast needed to ""drastically improve services"" after its contract to run the London to Glasgow route was extended by just six months.
It will continue to run services until next April.

politics	Boris Johnson 'clearly' going to stand to be PM, backer Jacob Rees-Mogg says	"Watch: Boris Johnson 'clearly' going to stand - Jacob Rees-Mogg
Boris Johnson is ""clearly"" still going to stand to be prime minister, after holding talks with his rival Rishi Sunak, one of his supporters has said. 
Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC the ex-PM had the 100 backers needed to be in the contest. 
However, just over half that number have publicly declared their support for Johnson, while former chancellor Mr Sunak has already passed the 100 mark. 
Mr Sunak officially declared on Sunday morning that he was running. 
He and Mr Johnson met on Saturday night, prompting speculation they could strike a deal.
would see one of them stand aside in the belief that it gives a clear run to the other, although Commons leader Penny Mordaunt has also declared her intention to stand. 
But asked what happened at the meeting, Sunak-backer Dominic Raab told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: ""I don't think there's any issues around deals here and that's not the right way to proceed.""
He added: ""What they did have was a very good conversation about the need for unity.""
Mr Sunak currently has 147 Conservative MPs who have publicly given him their backing, while Mr Johnson has 57 and Ms Mordaunt has 24, according to BBC research. 
Of the three, only Mr Johnson has not yet officially said he intends to run. 
Officially announcing his candidacy, Mr Sunak said the country was facing a ""profound economic crisis"" and as chancellor he had ""helped to steer our economy through the toughest of times"". 
He pledged to ""fix the biggest problems we face"" and ""deliver on the promise of the 2019 manifesto"", with ""integrity, professionalism and accountability"". 
Former home secretary Suella Braverman - who ran to be leader earlier this year - has thrown her support behind Mr Sunak, writing in The Telegraph that he could ""put our house in order and apply a steady, careful hand on the tiller"".
Mr Raab, who served as deputy prime minister under Mr Johnson, said Mr Sunak was ""the right person"" to be PM for both economic and political reasons. 
He said Mr Sunak had got the ""fundamental calls"" on the economy right and had the ""experience to deliver"" from his time as chancellor under Mr Johnson. 
Mr Raab added that Mr Sunak also had a broad range of support from Tory MPs, which was ""growing by the hour"". 
However, Mr Raab refused to say whether Mr Sunak would keep Jeremy Hunt as chancellor, saying it was not right to ""start handing out jobs"" during a leadership election. 
He added that Mr Sunak would ""put a government of all the talents"" in place. 
Ms Mordaunt has confirmed she would keep Mr Hunt in his role if she becomes PM to ensure a ""smooth transition of power"". 
r is due to give a statement on the government's plans for spending cuts and taxes on 31 October - just days after the new PM is set to be installed. 
Ms Mordaunt insisted she was ""in this to win it"" and denied reports she had been in touch with Mr Johnson's team about withdrawing from the contest in exchange for a prominent position.
Meanwhile, Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson was the ""greatest electoral asset"" his party had seen in modern times and highlighted his role in delivering Brexit, supporting Ukraine and getting the country through the Covid pandemic. 
Asked why the public should accept his return as prime minister given the scandals which forced him to leave office just over six weeks ago, Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson had a mandate from his 2019 general election victory. 
""Call for a general election is pretty hollow if the person who won the mandate is actually the prime minister,"" he added. 
Labour and other opposition parties have been calling for a general election, which is currently set for two years' time, following the resignation of Liz Truss. 
Leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC: ""Let the public in to decide. Do they want to continue with this utter chaos or do they want stability under a Labour government?""
However, to force an early general election the majority of MPs would need to support a motion of no confidence - meaning some Tories would have to vote down their own government. 
Sir Keir said Tory MPs had a choice to make ""because they can either put their party first or their country first"". 
Watch: Sir Keir Starmer says he is not being complacent about Labour's current popularity in the polls
Earlier, Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker, who is an influential figure on the right of the party, came out in support of Mr Sunak. 
former chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer Tory MPs said Mr Johnson becoming prime minister would be ""a guaranteed disaster"". 
He told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday a Johnson premiership would ""implode"" in the face of an investigation into whether he deliberately misled the Commons over what he knew about Covid rule-breaking at Downing Street.
Privileges Committee is due to begin taking oral evidence for its inquiry, including from Mr Johnson himself, in the coming weeks. 
Leadership contenders have until 14:00 BST on Monday to get the required 100 nominations to qualify for the next stage of the race. 
If Tory MPs get behind just one candidate, we could have a new prime minister by Monday afternoon.
But if not, it will then go to an online ballot of the Conservative party membership, with the result to be announced on Friday."	/news/uk-politics-63363420
politics	Boris Johnson: Don't back ex-PM, says his former Welsh secretary	"""Somebody with a bit of brain"" needs to take charge says one woman in Newtown, Powys
Former Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has warned fellow Conservative MPs against supporting the return of Boris Johnson as prime minister.
Mr Johnson has 41 MPs publicly backing his return to Downing Street, which he left only last month.
""This is not a joke. We're not trying to watch some sort of black-and-white repeats of the past and think it's all going to be great again,"" said Mr Hart.
Candidates to succeed Liz Truss need the support of at least 100 Tory MPs.
Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the chaos in government has bolstered calls for Welsh independence.
Senior Conservatives hoping to become the next prime minister have begun canvassing support among Tory MPs, with Penny Mordaunt the first candidate to officially enter the race. 
BBC Wales spoke to people in Rhondda, a constituency that has voted Labour in every general election since its current boundaries were set in 1974.
Cheryl Rees, 75, from Ton Pentre, said the situation in Westminster was ""dreadful, absolutely dreadful"". 
After Liz Truss, she said she was unsure if ""the Conservative government can keep going. That's why I think you need a general election"".
Mrs Rees said she was struggling with her gas and electric bills, but did not expect any more help from the next Conservative PM. 
""I think it's an absolute shambles,"" she said. 
David Brownnutt, 75, a retired Baptist minister from Tynewydd, said something needed to be done quickly about the ""absolute mess' in Westminster. 
""The economic situation in this country, the political situation in Europe,"" he said, ""we need a strong, sustainable government [that] knows what it's doing.""
Mr Brownnutt said the situation was so bad for poor people, there was no time for a general election. 
""Can we do what they used to do in wartime and have a government of national unity? Something has got to happen, because we cannot go on like this, particularly for the sake of the poor.""
Simon Hart was one of a handful of cabinet ministers who told Boris Johnson to stand down before resigning himself.
Conservative MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire told BBC Radio Wales the Tory leadership situation was ""embarrassing"" and a ""soap opera"".
""I find it quite difficult to face up to the reality of this,"" said Mr Hart, who is backing Rishi Sunak.
On Mr Johnson's possible return to Downing Street, he said an upcoming Commons inquiry into whether the former prime minister misled parliament could be a problem.
""We shouldn't forget that it was only a few weeks ago that 50-odd ministers, including me, resigned in the space of a few days because we had run out of road on the integrity ticket,"" he said. ""This is a moment where we can't take a gamble, we can't take a risk.""
Wales Office minister David TC Davies said Conservatives must rally behind the next prime minister or risk being wiped out at the next election.
Monmouth MP said ""back-biting and squabbling"" had badly damaged public trust in the party. 
He is also backing Mr Sunak, but pressed colleagues to fully support the successful candidate.
""I urge any Conservative MP to get behind whoever wins because the country doesn't want any more squabbling [or] a rabble all wanting their own favourite candidate,"" he said.
""We have to get behind whoever is there for stability, otherwise the party is going to fall apart.
""Problems have come about from people back-biting and talking to the press off the record because they want their favourite candidate to win and perhaps they've been promised a job.
""It's a long way back to win the next election and the Conservative Party has a huge amount of work to do to restore trust. It looks a mess when you go through prime ministers that quickly.""
Mr Sunak is another likely contender, while sources close to Mr Johnson neither confirm nor deny he will stand again.
A handful of Mr Johnson's biggest political supporters are pressing the former prime minister to make a comeback.
However Mr Davies fears the former prime minister remains a ""divisive"" character.
""I like him but I would be cautious because he is a divisive figure, which is something that doesn't bode very well,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.
""Rishi could get over that better. He did a good job running the economy during Covid and has the skills and experience to get us through this financial problem.""
Mr Davies' comments were echoed by the chairman of the Welsh Conservatives, Glyn Davies, who said he was ""depressed"" by the state of the party.
""The next leader has a huge challenge but the party throughout history has shown itself to be incredibly resilient,"" he said.
""Everyone can see that we need stability. There's a lot of noise right now but hopefully this selection process will bring that quickly to a head because we can't let this drift on.""
Westminster has fuelled calls for an independence referendum in Wales.
As Tory MPs prepare to select the UK's fourth prime minister in less than four years, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it was time for Wales to be ""insulated"" from a ""broken"" system.
Speaking before the party's conference in Llandudno this weekend, the former MP said: ""I spent nine years in Westminster and I've never seen anything like this. This awful mess is incredibly damaging to people's trust in politics.
""At a time when families are facing incredibly difficult pressures, where people are having to decide between heating or eating, we were crying out for leadership.
""We have a broken system in Westminster that is rotten to the core and the sooner we're out of it the better. 
""Wales would be better off as an independent nation and many would have come to that conclusion over the past few days.
""We have never voted as a nation for a majority of Conservative MPs so why is it that for two-thirds of the time we have been landed in Wales with a Conservative government. We're having to deal with the consequences of their mistakes time and again.""
Opposition parties are calling for a general election to decide who should be the next prime minister.
xt general election is not due to take place until at least 2024 and, at this stage, it looks unlikely that date will be brought forward.
First Minister Mark Drakeford, speaking immediately after Ms Truss's resignation on Thursday, said the ""complete and utter failure"" of her government must prompt a general election.
Shadow Welsh Secretary and Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens added: ""This is an absolute mess and enough is enough. 
""They should put the national interest first and call an election. It's about what's best for the country not Conservative Party survival. We've got to stop this nonsense.""
However, Mr Davies responded: ""Mark Drakeford, Nicola Sturgeon and the last Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, all came into office halfway through a term with a mandate from their parties, not the public."""	/news/uk-wales-63341527
politics	Eleven gambles that went wrong for Liz Truss	"In the autumn of 2022, Liz Truss bet her premiership on a so-called mini-budget that ripped up decades of economic orthodoxy. It did not pay off.
I spoke to those involved about the thinking behind the biggest risks she took during her seven weeks as prime minister - and why they did not succeed.
At the start of Liz Truss's leadership campaign, when I interviewed her on Radio 4's Today programme, I put it to her that she was gambling with the British economy by preparing to borrow as much as Jeremy Corbyn, whose policies she had condemned. 
She replied that the real gamble was to carry on as we were; condemned the economic ideas of the past 30 years pursued by both Conservative and Labour governments, which she called the ""Treasury orthodoxy""; and told me she was prepared to ""bulldoze"" opposition to her plans.
During the campaign, her rival, the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, called her ideas ""fantasy economics"". His ally Michael Gove said they were a ""holiday from reality"".
And, as it became ever more clear that she was going to win, her circle of advisers got smaller.
-cabinet minister and one-time Truss ally Simon Clarke describes the mood in the Truss campaign as ""revolutionary"". He says: ""You could definitely sense that she herself had resolved that it was do or die.""
Days after she moved into No 10, Truss sacked the Treasury Permanent Secretary Tom Scholar, a senior civil servant who had worked for chancellors from Gordon Brown to Rishi Sunak.

Once it had become clear she would win the Tory leadership election, officials met her at Chevening - her official residence as foreign secretary - but they did not warn her about her plans. 
was not their job to do so, given that Truss was not yet prime minister. But one political ally of Truss's, who asked not to be named, told me that anyone who challenged her was ""executed in that room"".
Indeed, very few of those who worked behind the scenes have been prepared to talk up until now. I've spoken to many off the record. Asa Bennett, Liz Truss's speechwriter both before and after she became prime minister, did agree to talk in public.
""It's safe to say that he [Scholar] would still have been in the job if he was deemed to be helpful,"" says Bennett. ""Certainly many saw him in the Tory Party as the personification of Treasury orthodoxy.""
Liz Truss's Big Gamble
Nick Robinson discovers the inside story of the UK's shortest ever premiership
Listen on BBC Sounds
russ did not trust the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the body set up by the former Conservative Chancellor George Osborne to make sure politicians could not fiddle official economic forecasts. 
She believed its forecasts were usually wrong and that it did not share her belief that tax cuts could stimulate growth and, potentially, pay for themselves.  
In order to bypass the OBR, she said her plans to spend billions on tax cuts were not a budget. They were instead what she initially called a fiscal event - language designed to ensure she could ignore the law that states that the OBR must issue forecasts whenever there is a budget.
world view echoed what Truss was hearing from those around her during the summer leadership campaign. 
Jon Moynihan, who was Liz Truss's main fundraiser and spoke to her regularly throughout the campaign, says: ""This whole idea that you have to get the tick of approval from the OBR, which has been consistently wrong in its financial forecasts is, in my view, anti-democratic.""
russ's allies in cabinet warned her that she needed to produce plans to cut spending to demonstrate how she intended to pay for tax cuts. 
minister who previously had been in charge of public spending at the Treasury, her new Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke, discussed plans with her to cut spending by five to 10%. 
And while there remained ministers back at the Treasury arguing for the need to talk about spending restraint - a paragraph spelling that out was removed by No 10 from the Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget speech. 
russ told them that cuts would ""distract from the message"" about tax and growth and they could ""worry later"" about it.
People who raised worries were told that they had become part of the ""Treasury orthodoxy"".
""We certainly discussed the importance of making sure tax and spend were in alignment,"" says Clarke, who at one point was rumoured to be a candidate to be Liz Truss's chancellor. 
""The question which sits at the heart of all of this is at what moment in her mind she decided that was not necessary… I think her appetite for radicalism had only consolidated.""
russ had a trio of friendly economists who gave her advice. They were known as the Trussketeers. 
One - Gerard Lyons - says that he warned her not to go further or faster than was expected by the financial markets and that he wrote a memo to the chancellor in the week of his mini-budget to repeat his warning.
""My view, both privately and publicly, was that any fiscal announcements needed to stick to what the markets had expected,"" he says. 
""I think all three outside economists stressed it was necessary to have a fully costed budget. The phrase I used: it was necessary to have your homework marked.""
russ's closest allies inside No 10 and in the cabinet did not know that she intended to cut the top rate of tax until the night before the mini-budget. 
Although the cost was relatively small compared with other tax-cutting plans, it sent a signal to voters and the markets that the new prime minister was willing to ignore concerns about unfairness - and was ideological in her approach to economics.
Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor, sat opposite Kwasi Kwarteng as he announced the plan.
""There's lots of things that we prepare for because we don't know what the big surprise is going to be in the budget,"" she says. 
""We didn't anticipate that happening. The reason that we didn't anticipate that happening is that it was bad economics and bad politics.""
In the fallout from the mini-budget, Truss hoped that reversing her plan to cut the top rate of tax would silence her critics. But she encouraged them to demand further changes - and also embarrassed and alienated her allies who, like the Daily Telegraph, had praised her as the lady who was not for turning. 
When she did backtrack - in the middle of the Conservative Party conference - even her most ardent fans were worried.
""I thought: 'It's the beginning of the end,'"" says Jon Moynihan. ""Concede on one, you would end up conceding on all.""
Jon Moynihan was right. Days after the Tory Party conference, Truss sacked Kwasi Kwarteng, her friend, long-term ally and the man who had implemented her ideas. 
She replaced him with Jeremy Hunt, who tore up almost every one of the policies in Kwarteng's mini-budget. 
Sir Graham Brady, Chair of the influential backbench 1922 Committee, could sense which way things were moving.
""I think at that point it was very difficult to see how the whole thing could just work,"" he says. 
""She could do everything possible to restore market confidence, but to do that she was ending up doing all of the opposite things to those that she promised to do.""
russ sacked almost all those who disagreed with her and promoted those who backed her. 
She did nothing to reach out to Rishi Sunak and his supporters despite the fact that he had won the support of more MPs than she had. 
Her allies accused her critics - like Michael Gove - of mounting a coup. They still believe that to be true.
Nadine Dorries, former Culture Secretary and an ally of Truss, is writing a book arguing that this was a case of conspiracy rather than cock-up.
""The moment she won the leadership competition, they were never going to let her stay. She was always going to be removed. I thought she may be there for six months. But I knew they weren't going to let her survive until the next election.""
russ's allies believe she was undermined by leaks from the Treasury and the hostility of the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which criticised her policies. 
russ's supporters - and some of her critics too - believe the people she had sacked, ignored or belittled were happy to see her fail. 
Some allege there was co-ordination between the Bank of England and the IMF in issuing critical statements which unnerved the markets. Senior officials in one organisation had previously worked in another or knew their counterparts well. 
Her allies blame the Treasury for briefing news of a possible climbdown on corporation tax, that bounced her into making the U-turn, then forced her to sack her chancellor, and ultimately cost her her job. 
""forces against her"" comprised ""such a huge proportion of the British establishment or blob"", says Jon Moynihan. 
""I don't think the Bank of England was particularly well-disposed towards the Truss government.""
Asked if there were people in the Treasury and at the IMF who wanted Truss's government to fail, Jon Moynihan says ""certainly"".
Liz Truss was nicknamed ""the human hand grenade"" but embraced this as a compliment rather than criticism.
Officials say she always wanted to be the most radical person in any room - which was fine when she was not the ultimate decision-maker and could be overruled. But once she was prime minister there was no-one empowered to hold her back. 
Her chief of staff was a political campaigner who openly admitted to having very limited knowledge about policy. Her chancellor was an old political friend and ally who said that he saw his job as delivering the PM's wishes. Her cabinet secretary had been told she planned to sack him and, insiders believe, did not want to stand up to her whilst his position was insecure.
russ was the Conservative Party members' choice to be PM. MPs who were not her supporters rushed to endorse her once they saw she was going to win. The Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph hailed her as Margaret Thatcher's successor. Her most ardent supporters attacked Rishi Sunak as a socialist. 
She, and they, gambled. Many would say, the country paid the price.

politics	UK visas: How does the points-based immigration system work?	"fference between the number of people entering and leaving the UK has reached an all-time high in the year to June 2022.
Downing Street insists that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wants to bring overall immigration levels down.
In the year ending June 2022, an estimated 1.1m came to the UK and 560,000 departed.
means net migration (the difference between people arriving and leaving) stood at an estimated 504,000.
represents a record high and an increase of 331,000 on the previous year (ending June 2021).
Office for National Statistics (ONS), which compiles the figures, said the rise was driven by non-EU migrants, specifically students, and the resumption of post-pandemic travel.
It also said the war in Ukraine, the resettlement of Afghans and the new visa route for Hong Kong British nationals had all contributed.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman says she wants to reduce net migration to the ""tens of thousands"".
Official immigration data gathering was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Estimates from June 2020 are based on different data sets and are not comparable with earlier years.
Before Brexit, European Union and UK citizens had the freedom to live and work in any other EU country without needing a work visa.
However, freedom of movement between the two came to an end on 1 January 2021.
In the year ending June 2022, net EU migration was -51,000. This means more EU nationals left the UK than arrived.
Net migration of non-EU nationals, on the other hand, was +509,000.
re was a net increase of +45,000 British nationals. The ONS said this figure included some British nationals arriving from Hong Kong as well as those returning during the pandemic.
Many Brexit supporters - including Ms Braverman - say leaving the EU has given the UK more control over migration policy.
Sir Keir Starmer has ruled out restoring freedom of movement and says the UK must wean itself off ""immigration dependency"".
However, the CBI - the UK's biggest business group - says immigration is needed to solve worker shortages and boost economic growth.
Most people wanting to work in the UK have to apply for a visa through a points-based system (PBS).
A points system was first adopted by the Labour government in 2008 and applied to migrants from non-EU countries. It was then overhauled by the Conservatives after the Brexit vote.
urrent PBS - which covers EU and non-EU migrants - was launched at the end of 2020. 
Applicants need enough points to qualify for a skilled worker visa.
A total of 70 points is required. Attributes like: English skills; qualifications; and being under 26 all count towards the total.
Having an offer of a skilled job from an approved employer and being able to speak English would give 50 points for example.
A further 20 points would also be awarded if the applicant's job pays at least £25,600 a year.
re are some exceptions. Certain jobs in health or education, for example, will still award 20 points even if the salary is less than £25,600.
rd fee for a skilled visa is usually between £625 and £1,423.
If granted, the visa will last for up to five years before it needs renewing.
A ""shortage occupation list"" exists to help employers fill certain roles. These jobs have a lower salary threshold, making it easier for applicants to gain the required number of points.
Jobs currently on the list include:
government updates the list based on advice from an independent group of experts - called the Migration Advisory Committee.
mporary work, like fruit picking, is covered by a seasonal worker visa.
Up to 40,000 of these visas are issues each year. However, the National Farmers' Union argues this number is too small and needs to increase to 70,000.
Workers who are granted a visa must be paid at least £10.10 an hour.
re is no limit on international students coming to the UK under the student visa application system. However, Ms Braverman has suggested she wants to reduce the number of partners and children who come to the UK with students.
Students who have already completed their degree can stay in the UK for two years under a graduate visa."	/news/uk-48785695

politics	Pensions: Downing Street refuses to commit to triple lock	"Rishi Sunak will not commit to raising the state pension in line with inflation ahead of a statement by his chancellor next month, No 10 has said. 
PM's spokesperson acknowledged that ""uncertainty"" over the state pension was ""difficult for pensioners"".
Just last week, his predecessor Liz Truss said she was committed to the pensions triple lock.
ge means payments rise by whichever is highest - inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.
Some Tories MPs have been concerned the manifesto pledge could be ditched and have argued pensioners should be given certainty their payments will keep up with the rising cost of living. 
Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, is currently running at a 40-year high of 10.1%, meaning wages, pensions and benefits are lagging behind prices.
PM's press secretary said a decision on whether to stick to the pensions triple lock would be ""wrapped up into the fiscal statement"" on 17 November. 
""But what I can say is he has shown through his record as chancellor is that he will do what's right and compassionate for the most vulnerable,"" she said. 
On Thursday, the PM's spokesman said Mr Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt would ""take the time to work carefully and diligently"" to develop policies that would provide long-term certainty in the face of ""challenging"" economic circumstances.
r's statement on the government's plans for tax and spending has been delayed by more than two weeks. 
will give Jeremy Hunt, who has been in the role for less than two weeks, more time to prepare, while the chancellor said it would also mean the plans were based on the ""most accurate"" economic forecasts. 
Mr Hunt had already scrapped almost all his predecessor's tax cuts but he still needs to find billions of pounds of savings to keep the UK's debt under control. 
SNP Westminster leader says people are facing a ""winter of uncertainty ahead""
During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak also would not commit to raising benefits in line with prices. 
SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford asked if the PM would ""reassure people and guarantee that benefits will rise in line with inflation in his upcoming budget"".
In response, Mr Sunak said: ""My record on this is clear. Through the difficult times that we faced in this country through Covid I always acted in a way to protect the most vulnerable.
""That's because it is the right thing to do and those are the values of our compassionate party, and I can absolutely reassure him and give him that commitment that we will continue to act like that in the weeks ahead.""
Mr Sunak's new work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, has previously suggested as a backbencher that benefits should keep pace with inflation. 
Pensions and benefits normally increase every April, with a decision taken the previous autumn.
riple lock has been in place ever since it was introduced under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010, apart from a one-year suspension during the pandemic.
Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth accused Mr Sunak of not being on the side of pensioners struggling through the cost-of-living crisis.
""Rishi Sunak stood on a manifesto in 2019 on a pledge to keep the triple lock. Now he's threatening that promise to Britain's retirees,"" he said. 
government faces a potential rebellion from some Tory MPs if it does not increase the state pension and benefits in line with inflation. 
Certain benefits, including disability benefits and carer's allowance, must increase in with inflation by law.
However, for working-age benefits like universal credit no decision has yet been made on whether a rise will be linked to prices or average wages."	/news/uk-politics-63407686
politics	How bad is the gender reform rebellion for the SNP?	"SNP has suffered its biggest-ever backbench rebellion since it came to power in Scotland, with nine MSPs failing to back the Scottish government's gender reform legislation. 
uded Ash Regan, who quit as the government's community safety minister shortly before the Holyrood vote.
How significant is the uprising and why have rebellions been so rare at the Scottish Parliament?
SNP was always expecting some of its MSPs to oppose its plan to make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised gender when it faced its first vote at Holyrood on Thursday.
government hoped this could be held to single figures, and it was - just - with seven SNP MSPs voting against the general principles of the bill, while two more abstained.
But it was clear from Nicola Sturgeon's icy response to Ms Regan's resignation letter that the first minister and her team are not happy at all. 
Ms Sturgeon said Ms Regan had not approached her to raise concerns before she quit - but friends of Ms Regan have disputed this, saying that the first minister was told of her opposition to the proposals by an adviser.
government clearly want to nip any spirit of rebellion in the bud, and isn't in the mood for letting pleasantries intrude while imposing discipline. 
ue the party has wrestled with for years, with the SNP being elected in 2016 and 2021 with manifesto commitments to reform the Gender Recognition Act, and it is keen to push on as quickly as possible after previously having to shelve the plans.
SNP has 64 MSPs. A total of 25 of them are (or at least were) ministers, and bound by collective responsibility - they are required to sing from the same hymn sheet when it comes to government policy.
means Ms Regan suffered the most immediate consequences, having given up her ministerial post while coming firmly under the spotlight in a topic where debate online often resembles a bin fire.
It also means eight out of the 39 backbenchers - 20% of the non-ministerial group - failed to vote with the government.
umber of rebels would cost the SNP-Green administration its majority, if they were to join a united opposition - an unnerving prospect for any government.
In this case, of course, it made little difference. The government still won the vote by 88 to 33, with four abstentions - every Labour, Lib Dem and Green MSP voted in favour, along with two Tories, who had been given a free vote.
going to pass comfortably through parliament and the government hopes that will put the issue to bed, at least at Holyrood, so that they can move on with the rest of their agenda.
SNP whips office - led by Gordon MacDonald - may be wondering what exactly to do now. They have never had to deal with a real rebellion before.
Ms Regan has lost her job, but it is unlikely that the nine rebels will lose the SNP whip. There are frankly too many of them, and this was not characterised as a confidence vote in the government.
A disagreement over this one issue doesn't change the fact they were elected as SNP MSPs and back the bulk of the party's agenda.
And they are united on the core issue which draws the SNP together. Earlier the same day, one of them was asking a helpful question at FMQs by querying whether Ms Sturgeon agreed that independence might be beneficial to Scotland.
A slap on the wrist seems the most likely outcome - if nothing else because at this early stage in a parliamentary term it could be better to keep these members inside the herd, rather than plotting on the outside.
really striking thing about this episode is how unprecedented it was.
Holyrood does not have a tradition of backbench unrest in the way Westminster does, and the SNP benches have been incredibly united and disciplined in public since it took power in 2007.
wo MSPs quit to sit as independents following a row over Nato membership in 2012, but that followed a conference vote rather than a parliamentary one.
Ms Regan is reckoned to be only the second ever minister to quit a Scottish government over a matter of policy.
And the other - former Labour communities minister Malcolm Chisholm - said he actually thought his vote against Trident renewal would have been allowed because it was about a reserved matter.
Parties have developed an ever-stronger grip on their MSPs in recent years, particularly as longer-serving members have retired or lost their seats.
w the likes of the SNP's Joan McAlpine and Alex Neil leaving the parliament, as did Adam Tomkins from the Conservatives, Neil Findlay and Johann Lamont from Labour, Andy Wightman from the Greens, and Mike Rumbles from the Lib Dems. 
All were free-thinking members who might have broken the whip on their day if they felt strongly about an issue. 
rocess for prized constituency seats and list rankings means new crops of members are typically grateful to party chiefs, and less likely to forge off in their own direction.
't mean we have been left with a parliament of compliant drones. Fergus Ewing and Christine Grahame frequently ask difficult questions from the SNP back benches.
Labour has the likes of Monica Lennon and Richard Leonard sitting occasionally at odds with the leadership, while in the gender reform vote, Jamie Greene and Sandesh Gulhane went against the rest of the Conservative group.
But there is concern that parties have completely taken over the parliamentary system.
In 2019, the original steering group of senior politicians who helped set up Holyrood wrote a report reflecting on 20 years of devolution.
mplained that the parliament is ""driven much more by party political tribalism than we expected"", noting that ""parties dominate the debate with little scope for personal contributions and inclusive discourse"".
""polarised"" nature of the party system had blunted the parliament's attempts to scrutinise the government, and that committees had become ""a forum for delivering party politics rather than for challenging ideas or building cross-party consensus"".
Because parties are ultimately in charge of MSP selection and of how the government and parliament are run, there is little prospect of this changing any time soon.
means rebellions like the one over the gender reform bill are likely to remain rare events."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63427332
politics	Liz Truss: Six moments from the PM's six chaotic weeks	"Liz Truss has resigned as the UK's prime minister after less than two months in office. From her first meeting with the Queen, to the chaos of her mini-budget, her six weeks in power have been a mix of historical moments and self-inflicted political crises. 
Here are six memorable moments from her short time in Downing Street.
ugh she will go down in history as the UK's shortest-serving prime minister, Ms Truss was pictured in the last public photograph of the country's longest-serving monarch. 
wo days before she died, the Queen officially invited Ms Truss - her 15th prime minister - to form a government.
f the pair shaking hands in Balmoral Castle sparked concerns about the Queen's health, because of her frail appearance.
Ms Truss described feeling ""hugely honoured"" to have met the Queen ""in one of her last acts"". 
Ms Truss campaigned on a plan to slash taxes and a couple of weeks into her term as prime minister, her Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, unveiled a programme of tax cuts worth £45bn ($51bn).
But Mr Kwarteng didn't explain how the cuts would be paid for. The mini-budget was announced on Friday - but when markets reopened on the following Monday morning, the pound fell to record lows against the dollar.
w not-so mini-budget sparked market turmoil, with the Bank of England having to step tens of billions of pounds to stabilise pension funds, and mortgage rates shot up.
r reversed some of this plan, but it did little to calm politicians in Ms Truss's own Conservative Party. 
It would be the first of a series of economic U-turns, prompting economic commentators to say that ""Trussonomics"" was dead. 
Watch: A dizzying 24 hours for UK politics... in under a minute
With the government troubled by market reaction and speculation of a major U-turn, Mr Kwarteng was called back from a meeting in Washington DC a day early, and he was sacked. 
Hours after the firing, Ms Truss gave a brief press conference during which she was grilled about her credibility as prime minister. ""How come you get to stay?"", asked one journalist. 
ugh she answered only four questions, she stumbled over her answers, insisting that she had acted to calm ""economic turmoil"". 
Her awkward eight-minute performance didn't convince Members of Parliament in her own party that she could stay on as leader. 
WATCH: 'Dear oh dear' - King Charles greets Truss
Video footage from inside the weekly audiences between the British monarch and their prime minister is rare. 
But when images were released of King Charles III meeting Ms Truss for the first time in Buckingham Palace, they did little to restore her public image. 
As she came under increasing pressure from her colleagues on the Tory benches, the King sent social media into overdrive after muttering ""dear oh dear"" while exchanging small talk with Ms Truss.
Some speculated that the monarch was offering commentary on Ms Truss's leadership, but sources told the BBC's  Chris Mason that he was expressing sympathy with the prime minister's hectic schedule. 
fore handing in her own resignation letter, Ms Truss was on the receiving end of one - from her Home Secretary, Suella Braverman. A former leadership rival of the prime minister, Ms Braverman quit over two data breaches. And she didn't go quietly. 
In her resignation letter, she said she had made a ""technical infringement"" by sending an official document from a personal email, and that she was now taking responsibility. 
""Pretending we haven't made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can't see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,"" she wrote. ""I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility; I resign."" 
message was taken as a public attack on the prime minister, criticising Ms Truss and her leadership in all but name. 
Ms Braverman also raised ""serious concerns about this government's commitment to honouring manifesto commitments"" on issues like immigration - a move seen by many commentators as an appeal for support to the hard-right of the party in a future leadership contest. 
When a political commentator joked that Ms Truss had ""roughly the shelf-life of a lettuce"", British newspaper the Daily Star responded by testing the theory on a live web-cam feed. 
usands watched ""lettuce-cam"", or a 60p Tesco lettuce in a blond wig next to a framed photo of prime minister. As the vegetable slowly wilted before their eyes, so did Ms Truss's grip on power. 
And when the PM announced her resignation, nearly 20,000 people tuned in to congratulate the lettuce on outlasting her. The national anthem was played, along with a remix of Kool and the Gang's ""Celebration"".  
""Lettuce rejoice,"" exclaimed the paper's front page later that day. 
And as a turbulent day in British politics drew to a close, the paper played one last trick. It projected an enormous image of the vegetable onto the exterior of the Palace of Westminster, before announcing on Twitter that ""the lettuce has made it to Parliament"". "	/news/uk-politics-63334457
politics	UK government could challenge Scottish gender change law	"Downing Street has not ruled out mounting a court challenge to a law set to be passed later this month by the Scottish Parliament, which will simplify the legal process for anyone in Scotland who wants to change their gender.
Scottish bill will shorten the timescale for anyone who wants to obtain a gender recognition certificate, a document allowing someone to change their gender on their birth certificate, from two years to three months.
rtificate means people can change some legal documents, and can also affect areas such as entitlement to benefits and pensions. 
Westminster government is also considering refusing to recognise certificates issued under the new Scottish system, which could cause problems for people with them who want to move to other parts of the UK.
Since 1999 some laws which apply in Scotland are made by MSPs in Edinburgh, while others are made by MPs at Westminster. 
UK government ministers are responsible for gender laws in England and Wales, and have no plans to move in the same direction as the Scottish government.
rime minister's official spokesman said: ""We've made no decisions on any potential action at this time.
""As the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and UN special rapporteur have set out, the Scottish government's proposals currently raise a number of clear concerns.""
In November, the UN rapporteur on violence against women and girls Reem Alsalem warned the legislation could increase risks to their safety by potentially allowing ""violent males"" to ""abuse"" the system. 
Scottish ministers say there is ""no evidence"" women or girls will be harmed by the bill.
Downing Street spokesman said: ""In order to understand the potential impact of the bill across the United Kingdom we will obviously monitor its progress closely as we do with any potential Bill.""
Asked if the UK government could challenge the legislation in the courts, he replied: ""We've made no decisions at this time.""
Scottish ministers have said they are happy to meet their UK counterparts to discuss their concerns - and officials in Edinburgh said they tried to set up talks in October, without any response.
SNP-led government believes the bill encompasses powers held solely in Edinburgh, so the UK government would not have grounds to mount a legal challenge.
Equalities Secretary Kemi Badenoch has now written to the Scottish government expressing concerns about the legislation, and has offered to meet Scottish ministers to discuss it.
Scottish Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison has said she would be ""happy to meet"" Ms Badenoch.  
A UK government source told the BBC they had concerns people from elsewhere in the UK might relocate to Scotland to change gender.
med Scottish ministers wanted to paint Scotland as a ""haven of inclusivity"" in comparison to a ""nasty Westminster"". 
urce described the Scottish legislation as a ""test case scenario"" of how a bill passed by the Scottish Parliament could ""undermine Westminster competencies"" - in other words, handing Holyrood powers beyond Scotland.
A separate UK official told the BBC there was ""genuine concern"" about the impact the legislation could have across the rest of the UK.  They added that they hoped a legal battle could be avoided."	/news/uk-politics-63909309

Protesters marched from Embankment to Trafalgar Square, where a rally is being held with various speakers.
Metropolitan Police said: ""There are currently a number of different demonstrations across London this afternoon.
""Several protests groups as expected are present in Trafalgar Square, with stewards on the ground working with police.""

Speaking at the rally, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government would be ""forced to listen"" to protesters calling for improved pay and workers rights.
""Governments do eventually listen because of popular movements,"" he said.
""The people out here are very determined.""
Michelle Uden, from south-east London, took her seven-year-old twin boys to the demonstration and said she wanted a change in leadership after struggling with the cost of living.

""If we don't stand up and fight we'll sit down and cry.""
Mrs Uden said she took her children to the protest as she wanted them to see ""democracy in action"".

politics	Government wins legal case over definition of woman	"A court has thrown out a challenge against the Scottish government's definition of a woman in law.
For Women Scotland group complained about the way a bill aimed at gender balance on boards had included trans people under the definition of women.
won an initial challenge earlier in 2022, but went back to court saying the law still conflates sex and gender.
Judge Lady Haldane said that the definition of sex was ""not limited to biological or birth sex"".
She said it could also include people with a gender recognition certificate after changing their legally recognised gender. 
judge also stated that sex and gender reassignment were separate and distinct characteristics but were not necessarily mutually exclusive.
In her decision, Lady Haldane wrote: ""I conclude that in this context, which is the meaning of sex for the purposes of the 2010 Act, 'sex' is not limited to biological or birth sex, but includes those in possession of a GRC obtained in accordance with the 2004 Act stating their acquired gender, and thus their sex.""
judgement comes the week before controversial Scottish government plans to make it easier for people to change their legally recognised gender are due to face a final vote at Holyrood. 
red on the Gender Representation on Public Boards Act, which was passed by MSPs in 2018.
gislation aims to ensure gender balance on public sector boards, and originally stated that the quota should include people who were living as a woman and who either had gone through or intended to go through the gender recognition process.
For Women Scotland argued that ministers had broken with the definitions laid out in the 2010 Equality Act, which includes separate protections on the basis of sex and of gender reassignment.
group lost an initial judicial review, but were successful on appeal when Lady Dorrian ruled that the bill ""conflates and confuses two separate and distinct protected characteristics"".
However the Scottish government responded by changing the guidance notes for the bill to say that it includes both women as defined by the Equality Act, and people with a gender recognition certificate as defined under the 2004 Gender Recognition Act.
It quotes directly from that Act, to say that ""where a full gender recognition certificate has been issued to a person that their acquired gender is female, the person's sex is of a woman"".
For Women Scotland argued that by making reference to sex, the government was ""still confusing the protected characteristics and are trying to redefine 'woman' yet again"".
However this was rejected by Lady Haldane, who concluded that: ""The revised statutory guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers is lawful"".
Susan Smith, co-director of For Women Scotland, said the group was ""obviously disappointed"" with the ruling and would be looking at grounds for appeal.
But she said it had provided clarity about what a gender recognition certificate (GRC) provides for, ahead of MSPs debating reforms to make it easier to obtain one.
She said: ""What a GRC does was never spelled out. We asked the Scottish government if they could give us their interpretation of what it meant for someone to have a GRC, and they said it was a simple administrative change and made no difference.
""And then they went into court and argued the opposite, and they've won. But it does mean they've been saying one thing to the courts and another thing to parliament.""
Ms Smith also suggested that the legislation currently going through parliament could be challenged too, saying it ""potentially trespasses on reserved matters"".
Holyrood bill at the heart of this challenge was really just the vehicle for a broader question about the roles of two big pieces of Westminster legislation - the Gender Recognition Act of 2004, and the 2010 Equality Act. 
In short, how does a certificate granted under the 2004 Act affect one's right to protections under the 2010 Act?
For Women Scotland and the Conservatives say the ruling reveals that a gender recognition certificate effectively counts as a change of sex under the Equality Act.
mplications for the single-sex spaces and services that women are entitled to under that law.
r side of the debate insist that it does nothing of the sort - rather it simply reiterates the position as they had always understood it.
rans people can still be barred from women-only spaces, certificate or no.
ry timely because the row now moves back into parliament, where MSPs are finalising plans to make it easier to obtain a gender recognition certificate. 
ruling is sure to be cited during next week's debate. On an issue which provokes strong feelings on both sides, it may be less sure to settle anything conclusively.
wo other groups - the Equality Network and Scottish Trans - said the ruling ""confirms the position and we and many others have understood it to be for well over a decade"".
: ""This ruling does not affect the exceptions in the Equality Act which mean that single-sex services can exclude trans people or treat them less favourable where it is a proportionate means to a legitimate aim.
""In short, the ruling confirms the status quo and the rights of women and trans people under it.""
A spokesman for the Scottish government said: ""We are pleased to note the outcome of this challenge.""
During a two-day hearing in November, For Women Scotland's KC Aidan O'Neill argued that a gender recognition certificate should not ""result in a change of sex"".
He said the court should bring the Gender Recognition Act ""back down to earth"", arguing that ""sex means biological sex, that man means biological man, that woman means biological woman"".
However the Scottish government's KC Ruth Crawford said the case had nothing to do with the process of getting a certificate or its effect in law.
She said the 2004 Act was ""unambiguous"" that a certificate provided for a change of sex, and that ""there is nothing in the 2010 Act which takes away from the fundamental proposition"" of that."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63956604
politics	Chinese bypass censors to remember Jiang Zemin	", spectacles and the word ""grandpa"" figure in posts by people in China as they remember the late Chinese leader Jiang Zemin and try to avoid the censors. 
Members of China's top leadership have never had individual accounts on local social media platforms and posts about them are routinely heavily filtered, to avoid people leaving messages critical of the Communist Party government.  
As a result, there has long been intense censorship of Jiang Zemin online.  
His death coincides with a wave of protests against the authorities' ""zero-Covid"" policy - an outpouring of frustration over frequent lockdowns, and some have chanted anti-government slogans.
Media posts about Mr Jiang's death show that millions of social media users have left comments - most of which are positive.  
But only a handful are available to view, and a search on Sina Weibo for ""Jiang Zemin"" only shows some 250 posts, all from government media accounts.  
Communist Party appears to want people to see comments from users wishing him ""a good journey"" to the afterlife. The majority of visible posts include a candle emoji, which is a common way of commemorating someone who has died.  
For users to talk at a more personal level about what he meant to them, they have had to coin nicknames.  
Historically, toad-related nicknames have become popular ways of referencing him, like ""Uncle Toad"".  
While these originally were a way of mocking or criticising the leader - much as there are people who compare President Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh - in recent years there has been a phenomenon of ""toad worship"" from Jiang fans. Users have posted pictures of amphibious creatures to speak about him nostalgically.
For years, social media platforms have tried to clamp down on toad- and frog-related messages. Very few such messages can consequently be found on the platforms  today. 
But some have circumvented censorship today by making croaking sounds to leave messages about the former leader.  
""Ribbit. Rest in peace,"" says one user, for example. 
Knowing that words that allude to Mr Jiang will likely be filtered, some web users have simply let pictures speak to mark his legacy.  
In the eastern city of Yangzhou, where Mr Jiang was born, social media users have posted floral tributes left outside historic buildings, apparently for Mr Jiang.
Some have posted a book cover that he features on, titled: ""The man who changed China"".  
Images are also to be found of Jiang Zemin's large, trademark glasses and the phrase ""Stay young, stay simple"". Some have posted emojis of sunglasses as a way of referencing him.  
As posts that contain the roman script rather than Chinese characters are less likely to be censored, many have posted simple messages saying ""RIP"", or ""Rest in peace"".  
However, a regular theme in such messages has been people mourning not just the end of his life, but the end of a bygone era.  
""RIP, looking back it was the best era; an era full of hope,"" says one user.  
""RIP, to you, and the era,"" says another.  
One goes further saying: ""I will miss you, because things are so bad now. RIP.""  
""Nucleic acid tests and quarantine cabins should not be the backdrop of this country, but self-confidence and openness. RIP,"" says one, posting a picture of Mr Jiang smiling with former western leaders.
Some have acknowledged that Jiang's animated expressions meant he was sometimes a figure of fun.  
""When I was in high school, I just liked to send memes [of Jiang] to my friends,"" says one Weibo user. ""It is only now that I understand and long for an era when things were gradually opening up, and everyone's eyes were shining.""  
Others have acknowledged that they've found they feel ""neither happy nor sad"" to hear of Jiang's death. ""As a politician, he was complicated, multi-faceted, and contradictory. It will be history that evaluates his rights and wrongs."" 
With the leader of the country such a strong presence in people's lives, a wildly popular nickname for Jiang when news broke of his death was ""Grandpa Jiang"". But a search for this today brings up the message ""According to relevant laws, regulations and policies, results for 'Grandpa Jiang' cannot be displayed."" 
""Grandpa"", however, is not censored, so floods of user comments about ""Grandpa Jiang"" can be seen.  
While many have posted how they feel sad to hear about the death of their ""grandpa"", some appear to have taken the word ""grandpa"" - which also means an older man in Chinese - as a metaphor for ""president"". 
Users appear to have done this to make comments critical of the country's current leader, President Xi Jinping.  
""There are good grandpas who open up to the outside world, and bad grandpas who close the country.""  
""Everyone misses him so much, will a certain 'grandpa' be jealous?"" one asks. "	/news/world-asia-china-63813122
politics	Autumn statement: Fairer tax choices could have been made - Reeves	"Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has criticised the government for its failure to abolish the non-dom tax status and other measures announced in yesterday's Autumn Statement.
Reeves also told BBC Breakfast that Labour had ""a serious plan to grow the economy'."	/news/uk-politics-63675241
politics	Chris Mason: What to expect from politics in 2023	"2022 was transformative.
r gone by, with the political decapitation of two prime ministers, repeatedly changed how we are governed, and by whom.
But it also radically altered the dynamic between our political parties.
As we look ahead to 2023, it's the chaos of 2022 in the rear view mirror that moulds what appears to be the political road ahead.
For a start, political leaders across Westminster don't expect 2023 to be a general election year.
Only Rishi Sunak or a significant chunk of Conservative MPs alongside opposition parties could bring about an early election, and given Tory opinion poll ratings are in the gutter, that seems unlikely, as things stand.
widespread expectation is the Conservatives will run the clock down on this parliamentary term.
re has to be a general election by January 2025 at the latest.
urrent guessing game tends to conclude that the summer or autumn of 2024 is the most likely timing. 
So that means 2023 will likely be the year before an election year - and that is likely to shape how the next 12 months feel. 
""The year the election is won or lost,"" as one senior Labour figure put it to me. ""The campaign probably won't make much difference. But 2023 will.""
""It was a flipping disaster,"" one senior minister nearly said to me just before Christmas, reflecting on the months just gone. 
I don't want to crack your screen by quoting them verbatim. 
reaction to the toppling of first Boris Johnson and then Liz Truss has had several consequences.
Firstly, it's made dull exciting again. 
After a year of thrash metal, an interlude of mild jazz will have a contrasting appeal to some.
Rishi Sunak embarked on his stint as prime minister by seeking to make a virtue of a quiet seriousness.
His team decided they wouldn't be noisily picking public fights, especially with their own side.
But, as we saw in the final weeks of the year, when you're in Downing Street, noisy public fights knock on that front door nearly daily and you have to choose how to respond.
maintain that quietness can mean conceding, as Mr Sunak did on allowing onshore wind farms in England and diluting house building targets in England after pressure from his own backbenchers. 
It poses a question about how much the prime minister will be able to get done on his own terms in 2023.
And how restive his backbenchers may become, particularly if the local elections in May are bleak for the Conservatives.
But one consequence of 2022 should help Mr Sunak.
I was chatting to a Cabinet minister the other day, who was reflecting that so bonkers was the instability in the Conservative Party over the last 12 months, its appetite for insurrection, for civil war, has waned.
A party which, at points, appeared to have a death wish, has had second thoughts.
As we have already seen, that doesn't mean by any means backbenchers are powerless, but talk of toppling the leaders, plotting leadership campaigns and such like feels very 2022.
kdrop to everything is inflation pickpocketing us all and accelerating the waves of strikes we've already seen and will continue to see well into the new year.
Will ministers be able to continue to resist offering public sector workers more money?
Will the rate of price rises ease sufficiently quickly, or public opinion turn against strikers sufficiently fast for the government to be able to avoid this?
On this theme, in the early weeks of January, we can expect to see the government broaden out its plan to try to reduce the impact of industrial action, especially in the emergency services.
re are ministers pushing to see strikes banned for ambulance staff and firefighters.
Others say higher minimum service levels must be set down in law, to at least minimise the impact of such strikes.
And legislation is also promised by Rishi Sunak on small boat crossings over the Channel.
Both these issues are likely to, broadly at least, bring together the Tory backbenches, and pose interesting questions for how Labour responds.
So how will Labour approach 2023?
""I go around reminding anyone in the party who'll listen that we absolutely cannot be complacent,"" one senior figure tells me over a cuppa.
""We are up against the most successful electoral force there has ever been in western democracy,"" they add, referring to the Conservatives.
fact the word ""complacency"" and the potential dangers of it for Labour is even uttered tells you everything about just how transformative 2022 was.
As Conservative fortunes in the opinion polls cratered, Labour's headed towards the moon.
Most on both sides think the current polls flatter Labour, Conservative support will pick up and things will tighten in the run in to an election.
But, nonetheless, the working assumption around Westminster is it is likely Labour will form the next government.
umption, even if it turns out to be wrong, is important, because it shapes the political weather of the year ahead.
Being seen as a government in waiting brings with it greater scrutiny.
""What would you do?"" Will be asked of Keir Starmer and his shadow cabinet every single day of 2023.
And, often, they will sound circumspect; reticent to set out too many specific policies too early, for fear they are hostages to fortune (ie duds) or (so good) they get nicked from under their nose and implemented by the government.
Sir Keir has already spent time trying to box off potential points of vulnerability for a party seeking to persuade people who voted Conservative last time to vote Labour next time.
Hence his desire not to question the fundamentals of the UK's new relationship with the European Union and his claim the UK has an ""immigration dependency"" as he put it. 
His challenge now, those close to him acknowledge, is to better shape people's understanding of what he stands for and make the positive case for voting Labour, rather than merely being the default alternative for those fed up of the Conservatives.
Expect 2023 to be the year the party attempts to build the profile of a handful of senior shadow cabinet figures; the faces and voices making Labour's case on the telly, radio and online.
Don't be surprised to see and hear more from the likes of shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, the shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson and the shadow health secretary Wes Streeting among others. 
And privately, there'll be more pleas to avoid complacency. 
""The polls can't predict events,"" warns one adviser. ""Who knows what might happen?""
ry for plenty of the opposition parties at Westminster is one of confidence.
SNP remain the overwhelmingly dominant force in Scottish politics: 15 years in government at Holyrood, and with three quarters of the nation's MPs.
But their options for securing their much dreamed about second independence referendum are running out and Labour's apparent resurgence poses interesting questions for them too.
""Scotland ends up with Tory governments it doesn't vote for"" isn't quite so electorally potent if a Labour government looks increasingly likely after the next election.
So we are already seeing the SNP tilt some of its attack lines in Labour's direction as well as the Conservatives'.
And the party at Westminster is under new leadership: Stephen Flynn has replaced Ian Blackford; the SNP will have a new face and voice in 2023.
Sir Ed Davey's party has just 14 MPs. 
re tiddlers in parliamentary terms, making up just over 2% of MPs at Westminster.
But there is a fair chance they have an outsized contribution to make for the remainder of this Parliament.
use of their by-election performances: their win in Tiverton and Honiton in Devon in 2022, after their wins in North Shropshire and Chesham and Amersham in Buckinghamshire in 2021.

politics	Next election will be independence vote - Nicola Sturgeon	"Nicola Sturgeon says the next election will be a ""de facto"" vote on Scottish independence
Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP will use the next general election as an attempt to show a majority of people in Scotland support independence.
first minister was responding to the Supreme Court's unanimous ruling she does not have the power to hold a referendum next year. 
Ms Sturgeon said she respected the ruling, which she admitted was a ""tough pill to swallow"". 
But she said the independence movement had to now find a new way forward. 
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak welcomed the ""clear and definitive ruling from the Supreme Court"".
He told MPs: ""The people of Scotland want us to be working on fixing the major challenges that we collectively face, whether that's the economy, supporting the NHS or indeed supporting Ukraine.
""Now is the time for politicians to work together and that's what this government will do."" 
Ms Sturgeon had wanted to hold a referendum on 19 October next year but the UK government has refused to grant the formal consent that was in place ahead of the last referendum in 2014, when voters backed staying in the UK by 55% to 45%. 
Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to legislate on the constitution, including the union between Scotland and England, without that consent being in place. 
Speaking to the media at a hotel in Edinburgh after the ruling was announced, Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that there would be a ""real sense of frustration today in both the SNP and in the wider movement"".
But she said that she believed this would be ""short-lived"", predicted that rallies planned for several towns and cities across Scotland on Wednesday evening would show the ""strength"" of the independence campaign. 
Ms Sturgeon said her preferred route to independence was still through a referendum, but admitted that there was currently little prospect of Mr Sunak changing his opposition to a vote being held. 
She said this showed that the UK was not a voluntary union, and accused the UK government of ""outright democracy-denial"", a position she predicted was ""unsustainable"". 
first minister added: ""We must and we will find another democratic, lawful means for Scottish people to express their will"", with the next general election being the most obvious vehicle for that.
She said the SNP would now begin the process of deciding precisely how a ""de facto"" referendum would work, with a special party conference to be held in the new year. 
rty will also launch a ""major campaign in defence of Scottish democracy"", she said.  
Conservatives and Labour have already rejected the idea of the election acting as a referendum, arguing that general elections are fought on a range of issues and not just the constitution. 
SNP won 45% of the votes in Scotland at the last general election in 2019 while winning 48 of the 59 seats. 
Recent opinion polls have suggested that the country is essentially split down the middle on the independence question, but with a very narrow majority in favour of staying in the UK.
Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that unless the UK government suddenly and unexpectedly agrees to an independence referendum, she will take the campaign into the next UK general election.
Plan C - to seek to win majority support for independence from Scottish voters in that election and, if achieved, to claim that as a mandate for Scotland to leave the union.
It will be for a special SNP conference in the new year to decide the details of this approach - including what the question would be and what Nicola Sturgeon should do if her party and its allies win more than 50% of the vote.
It is a big gamble. The SNP has never won that big before. 16 and 17-year-olds don't get the vote in a UK election. Any number of other issues will be in play and there is likely to be a close focus on the battle between Labour and the Conservatives for Number 10.
re is, of course, no guarantee that the next prime minister would accept the election outcome as if it had been a single issue referendum.
Nicola Sturgeon would not be drawn on her future or the impact on the independence campaign if the SNP falls short in that election, except to say that ""if we can't win, we don't deserve to be independent""."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63730653

politics	First Minister Nicola Sturgeon speaks to new PM Rishi Sunak	"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has spoken to new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on his first day in office.
Afterwards Ms Sturgeon said that the call with Mr Sunak had been ""constructive"".
And the prime minister confirmed he ""emphasised"" their duty to work closely together.
It came just hours after the former chancellor succeeded Liz Truss and became the UK's third prime minister since September. 
Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ""I expressed hope that we will build a UK/Scot gov relationship based on mutual respect - inc for mandates - and my fear that further austerity will do real damage to people & public services. I look forward to further engagement soon.""
Last month Ms Sturgeon revealed she had not had a phone call with Ms Truss more than a month after she became prime minister.
But Mr Sunak spoke to both the first minister and her Welsh counterpart Mark Drakeford on Tuesday evening.
He later posted: ""I emphasised our duty to work closely together to respond to the shared challenges we face, so that collectively we can deliver for the people of the United Kingdom.""
Earlier, the new prime minister confirmed that Alister Jack will continue in his role as Secretary of State for Scotland.
Mr Sunak announced his new cabinet shortly after being invited to form a new government by King Charles.
uded Jeremy Hunt remaining as Chancellor, James Cleverly as foreign secretary, Ben Wallace as defence secretary and Suella Braverman returning as home secretary.
Liz Truss went seven weeks and her entire career as prime minister without speaking to the Scottish and Welsh first ministers but Rishi Sunak has done it on day one. 
I imagine they'll see a courtesy phone call as a low bar to cross, but it's a start.
For all that Mr Sunak is making more of an effort to engage with Nicola Sturgeon, I don't know if their relationship will necessarily be much warmer.
In the summer he said her plan for an independence referendum was ""barmy"" and that he wanted to ""take her on and beat her"".
PM's relationship with Scotland and Holyrood will also have a big bearing. 
He has talked about leading the ""most active UK-wide government in decades"", ending the ""devolve and forget"" approach and holding the Scottish government to account. 
All of which will inevitably spark clashes with Scottish ministers.
During the Conservative leadership contest in the summer Ms Truss made headlines when she claimed it was best to ignore ""attention seeker"" Ms Sturgeon.
But Mr Sunak later said ignoring the SNP would be ""dangerously complacent"".
And he described Ms Sturgeon and her party as ""an existential threat to our cherished union"".
On Monday the first minister congratulated Mr Sunak but urged him to call an early general election.
She also warned he must not unleash a new wave of austerity on the UK.  
And commenting on Mr Sunak's opposition to her plans for another Scottish independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said it was for the people of Scotland to decide.
She added: ""Scottish democracy will not be the prisoner of Rishi Sunak or any British prime minister."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63393659

politics	National Care Service costs significantly understated, says spending watchdog	"Scottish government's ""price tag"" for a new National Care Service is likely to be significantly understated, Audit Scotland has said.
g watchdog has highlighted a number of concerns about the service which would make ministers accountable for adult social care in Scotland.
government initially said it could cost up to £0.5bn to deliver.
By mid-October, Scottish Parliament researchers estimated the bill over five years to be £664m to £1.261bn.
In a written submission to parliament, Audit Scotland has highlighted issues with pensions, VAT changes, capital investment and health board transition costs, which could see the final total increase further.
It says ""a number of costs associated with the measures... have yet to be assessed"" and that ""the potential for additional cost is significant"".
roposed National Care Service is currently the subject of a bill making its way through parliament.
It would see the setting-up of a series of care boards that operate in the same way as health boards, with Scottish ministers directly responsible.
It means local authorities would no longer run social care services, while aiming to support people in their own homes or among family, friends and community wherever possible.
Scottish government has touted the move as potentially the most significant since the creation of the NHS.
However, opposition parties and union leaders have described it as a government ""power grab"" and an ""all-out assault on local democracy"".
Some SNP MSPs have also been publicly critical, with Kenneth Gibson saying the policy ""seemed like a sledgehammer to crack a nut"" if it does not provide the funding to address issues in the healthcare sector.
His party colleague Michelle Thomson also said she had ""no confidence whatsoever"" that the service's financial memorandum represents any level of accuracy or value for money.
Holyrood's finance and public administration committee has begun hearing evidence from health and social care bosses, as well as Audit Scotland's audit director Mark Taylor.
Mr Taylor told MSPs lessons should be learned from the creation of other new services like Social Security Scotland.
He said: ""Government needs to be able to be much clearer, at a much earlier stage, about its financial plans.""
Responding to a question from the SNP's Michelle Thomson, he said the purpose of the National Care Service was to improve standards and consistency.
""What's not clear, and understandably so, is the price tag that will ultimately be associated with that,"" he said.
""If that is to be levelling up - to use that politically loaded phrase - if it's about areas where the quality and consistency of the service falls below a certain standard, does that have a price tag attached to it?""
Mr Taylor added: ""What's the price tag, what's the cost associated with that service redesign?
""I understand at this stage of the process that it's very difficult to get a sense of that, but that's the hidden cost here.""
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf previously said the creation of a National Care Service for Scotland would end the ""postcode lottery"" in the sector.

politics	Swinney reveals further £615m of spending cuts	"John Swinney expects an ""eye-watering"" amount of spending cuts and tax rises for Scotland
Scotland's finance secretary has unveiled details of a further £615m worth of spending cuts.
""reductions and reprioritisations"" are in addition to another £560m of cuts that were announced in September. 
John Swinney said the financial situation facing the Scottish government was by far the most challenging since devolution.
And soaring inflation meant this year's budget was now worth £1.7bn less than when it was introduced last December.
Mr Swinney also said savings needed to be made to offset the impact of Brexit, public sector pay deals and help for Ukrainian refugees.
measures he announced included reprioritising £400m from the NHS budget in order to provide a ""fair pay deal"" for health staff - although he stressed that the overall NHS budget was unchanged. 
Some £116m of this had been due to be spent on Covid vaccines, testing and PPE, with a further £38m coming from the mental health budget and £63m from ""re-phasing and pausing"" programmes including the Scottish Trauma Network.
It also includes £65m from primary care services and £70m from ""social care and National Care Service re-profiling"". 
Money will also be taken from budgets across most other Scottish government departments, with Mr Swinney announcing £33m of resource budget savings and £180m of capital savings and financial transaction reductions in his emergency spending review. 
gs include delays to new college projects and housebuilding.
And the measures mean there will be £16m less for the broadband rollout to remoter parts of Scotland, while support for bus operators to upgrade their fleets to low emission vehicles will be reduced by £29m.
Mr Swinney said the Scottish government did not have the necessary borrowing powers to meet the increased costs that were facing it, or to change income tax rates before the start of the next financial year. 
meant that every additional pound that was spent in one area meant a pound less could be spent somewhere else, he said.
He added: ""I must balance the books, but I am committed to doing so in a way that prioritises funding to help families, to back business, to provide fair pay awards and to protect the delivery of public services.""
review was established in the summer to ""assess any and all opportunities to redirect additional resources to those most in need, reduce the burdens on business and stimulate the Scottish economy"".
figures being thrown around at Holyrood are not insignificant ones, when you consider the Scottish government's total budget is in the region of £50bn.
A lot of money has gone towards public sector pay deals, which does at least help workers deal with rising prices themselves.
But a worrying amount of cash is simply being lost to inflation, which is wreaking havoc with government budgets as much as household ones.
And to make it worse, this is just the beginning.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has warned he will have difficult choices to make in his autumn statement in a fortnight's time.
Mr Swinney then sets his budget for the coming year on 15 December, with many departments braced for real-terms cuts. Holyrood's committees are already hearing grim talk of some services being ""hollowed out"" or shutting down entirely.
ming weeks will be where that talk could become a reality, as ministers are forced to follow through on those difficult choices.
Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith the global financial situation ""do not absolve Mr Swinney or his colleagues of responsibility for the position Scotland finds itself in after fifteen years of their government"".
She said Mr Swinney had announced ""more huge cuts to health, education and justice"" but had not touched the budget for another independence referendum, and questioned whether now was the time to be introducing a new National Care Service. 
Labour's Daniel Johnson said ""chaos"" from the UK government had made the situation more difficult.
But he also criticised the number of foreign trips taken by the Angus Robertson, the Scottish government's external affairs secretary.
Mr Johnson said: ""I note that the cabinet secretary for external affairs has travelled to eight countries in as many months, clocking up almost 22,000 air miles.
""What cost control measures are being applied to the expenditures of members of the Government and civil servants?""
Mr Swinney's review statement was initially expected within a fortnight of the UK government's infamous mini-budget, which was announced on 23 September by then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng. 
Amid the resulting fallout at Westminster, which saw most of the plans reversed and both Mr Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss lose their jobs, the Holyrood update was delayed in anticipation of a UK government autumn statement scheduled for 31 October. 
was then pushed back to 17 November but the Scottish government decided it could not wait until then to announce its changes. 
Scottish government will announce its budget for next year on 15 December, which will include any changes it intends to make to income tax rates and bands. "	/news/uk-scotland-63484112
politics	NI Troubles: Amendments on controversial legacy bill revealed	"government has told peers it will bring forward amendments to its controversial Troubles legacy bill.
Lord Caine said on Wednesday this would include ""a more robust process"" around immunity from prosecution.
He said the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) would be able to conduct criminal investigations.
ffers a conditional amnesty to those accused of killings and other Troubles-related crimes.
Lord Caine of the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) told the House of Lords anyone who did not co-operate with the ICRIR and went on to be convicted of a Troubles-related offence would serve a full sentence.
In May, the government introduced legislation that aimed to draw a line under the conflict by dealing with so-called legacy issues.
It was an attempt to deal with more than 1,000 unsolved killings.
Victims' groups and political parties at Stormont are opposed to the bill, arguing it will remove access to justice for victims and their families.
Lord Caine said he had personally found the legislation ""extremely challenging"" and he appreciated this would be the case for many.
Discussing his involvement in Northern Ireland, he said he had ""heard countless harrowing and heart-wrenching stories of suffering"".
""So I am hardly immune to the feelings of those affected by the Troubles who find this bill difficult and challenging,"" he added.
""At the same time, I am conscious as anyone, based on experience, that we will never solve the past or to bring, to use that horrible word, closure in every case.
""Equally, I am clear that no government can legislate to reconcile people though we can strive to promote it, but we can attempt to provide better and realistic outcomes.""
Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill had its second reading in the Lords on Wednesday.
mendments will next be discussed at committee stage in December.
Despite signalling new amendments, the bill continues to face a barrage of criticisms.
government appears to be fighting a losing battle over widespread buy-in in Northern Ireland.
Where does that leave one of the bill's goals of helping reconciliation?
Victims' groups and local political parties are still not won over and it's fair to ask whether they ever will be?
government seems completely wedded to the concept of amnesties, which is where it faces most anger.
It is promising more engagement and there could be further changes.
But it has the parliamentary numbers to pass the bill and is pressing ahead.
government said on Wednesday its amendments will:
In a statement earlier, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said the government understood ""how important addressing the legacy of the past is for Northern Ireland, and is determined to deliver better outcomes for those most impacted by the Troubles, including victims and survivors, as well as veterans"".
""I have been clear that the government would consider changes to this bill seriously,"" he added.
""The changes announced today reflect the significant engagement that has taken place on the bill, and seek to address concerns that have been raised by many stakeholders.
""I also recognise that, even with these changes, this bill will remain challenging for many, and that concerns will remain.""
revious Northern Ireland Secretary Shailesh Vara said the government was open to making changes to the bill in August.
Under the legislation, immunity from prosecution will be offered to those who co-operate with Troubles investigations run by the new information recovery body.
ICRIR will be headed by a judicial figure appointed by the government and will accept applications for immunity for five years.
After that time, reviews will not be able to be requested but the ICRIR will continue to work through uncompleted cases.
A panel within it will be responsible for deciding if a perpetrator qualifies for immunity and once granted it cannot be revoked.
It will still take months before the legislation makes it into law and takes effect.
Commissioner for Victims and Survivors Ian Jeffers said while the commission remained opposed to the bill he welcomed that changes would be made.
""It is good to hear that he (Lord Caine) has been listening to the concerns of victims and survivors,"" he said.
""At this stage I am still of the opinion that the amendments will not go far enough to make the legislation effective for victims and survivors.""
In the Lords on Wednesday, many peers spoke out against the proposed bill.
Urging a rethink of the legislation, Labour former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Murphy of Torfaen said he ""wouldn't touch it with a barge pole"".
Lord Eames, who served as Primate of All Ireland and Archbishop of Armagh from 1986 to 2006, said the bill needed to be heavily amended to centre on the suffering of victims of Troubles victims.
Former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales Lord Judge said the legislation would make some men and women guilty exempt from prosecution.
""If the bill is enacted in its present form, they will literally be getting away or have got away with murder.""
Labour former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Hain said he was flatly opposed to the bill and would vote to kill it if given the opportunity. 
""The effect of this legislation would be to make some of the most heinous crimes simply disappear,"" he said.
Former SDLP leader Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick said: ""This Bill should be scrapped and scrapped now.""
Former deputy leader of the DUP, Lord Dodds of Duncairn, said: ""The way to address legitimate concerns about vexatious investigations against veterans who served in Northern Ireland is not simply to impose a wholesale restriction on historical investigations or prosecution, it's to restore balance, ensure investigative activity is proportionate and to bring an end to the growing culture of politically-motivated actions against those who served in uniform""."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63737325
politics	What are the plans for gender reforms in Scotland?	"Legislation that aims to make it easier for people in Scotland to change their legally recognised gender has divided opinion.
MSPs voted to pass the controversial Gender Recognition Bill by 86 votes to 39, though it could still be blocked by the UK government.
Scottish government wants to simplify and speed up the existing process by which people can obtain a gender recognition certificate - the legal recognition of a trans person's ""acquired"" gender.
At present, people apply to a UK gender recognition panel and typically must present a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. 
fined by the NHS as being caused by a ""mismatch"" between their biological sex (whether they were born physically male or female) and their gender identity (the way in which they see and describe themselves).
Applicants need to provide two medical reports, one from a specialist detailing their diagnosis and another listing any treatment or surgery they may have had to change their sexual characteristics.
must also prove they have lived full-time in their acquired gender for at least two years - for example showing they have used a different name in official documents, or changed their gender on their driving licence or passport - and swear an oath that they intend to continue for the rest of their lives.
What reforms are being proposed and why have they proved so controversial?
Scottish government argues that the current process is too difficult and invasive, and causes distress to an already marginalised and vulnerable minority group. 
Its proposal would see applications handled by the Registrar General for Scotland, rather than the UK panel.
No diagnosis or medical reports would be required, and the period in which applicants need to have lived in their acquired gender would be cut to three months.
One of the most controversial proposals is to lower the minimum age that someone can apply from 18 to 16 - although an amendment to the bill that has been backed by the government means that 16 and 17-year-olds would need to have lived as their acquired gender for six months rather than three.
Anyone wanting to change their legal gender will still need to swear an oath about remaining this way for life - with it being a criminal offence to make a false declaration or application - and there would be a three-month ""reflection period"" before a certificate was issued.
In theory, only a small number of people would be directly affected by any reforms, with the NHS estimating that transgender people make up about 0.5% of the population. 
Ireland made similar changes in 2015 and had granted an average of 115 applications per year up to 2020.
However, some campaigners are concerned that allowing anyone to ""self-identify"" as a woman could impact on the rights women have fought for decades to secure, and which are themselves enshrined in equalities law.
re are also concerns about access to women-only spaces and services, including hospital wards and refuges. 
While attitudes towards gender may have become more fluid, many things in society are still binary - from changing rooms to elite sporting events to prisons - and some are wary about changing this.
relatively narrow issue of the certification process has become a focal point for a broader debate about gender identity and politics. And this debate has become hotly contested, in particular online.
first minister has acknowledged that some people have ""genuinely held concerns"" about the plans - while arguing that others have latched onto the issue to spread transphobia.
She has described herself as ""a lifelong feminist"" but said it is ""really important"" to protect and enhance the rights of trans people.
And Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly insisted that trans rights and women's rights need not clash.
SNP leader has also hit out at transphobia within her own party.
Equalities and Human Rights Commission - which initially backed the Scottish government's proposals as a ""simplified system"" - has now urged ministers to rethink the plans and said that the existing system provides ""the correct balanced legal framework that protects everyone"".
Several prominent SNP politicians - including government ministers Kate Forbes, Ash Regan and Ivan McKee - signed a letter in 2019 urging the government not to ""rush"" the proposals, arguing that ""changing the definition of male and female is a matter of profound significance"".
In October, Ms Regan quit as a government minister ahead of a debate on the bill, saying that her conscience would not allow her to support the plans.
Author JK Rowling has become one of the most prominent voices in the debate, saying that reading about the Scottish government's proposals had ""triggered"" her due to memories of being sexually assaulted.
Ms Rowling said her life had been ""shaped by being female"" and argued that ""erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives"".

A report by the ISC refers to newspaper interviews by MI5 and GCHQ bosses, and the head of MI6's Twitter account. 
Spy chiefs have also appeared on the BBC, and the head of GCHQ is set to guest edit Radio 4's Today programme.
Agencies have used social media and interviews to explain their work and increase recruitment and diversity.
In its annual report, the committee said it recognised the ""important role public outreach can play in attracting employees by opening up about the culture and working practices in such secret organisations"" - but it said such activity ""must be undertaken in a strategic and considered manner"".
It added: ""The committee is concerned that, if media engagement strategies go too far, they risk trivialising the important work of the agencies and diverting their focus from national security priorities. Social media is also known to be a battleground for covert hostile state action, so any enhanced media engagement should not undermine the agencies' ability to act covertly and keep the UK safe.""  
It pointed to a number of recent interviews by spy chiefs - and the head of MI6's Twitter account. 
Richard Moore, also known as 'C', tweets far more than any other head past or present of an agency.
MPs also pointed to anonymised media interviews with lower-ranking employees, saying there had been ""a clear step-change for the agencies, who have traditionally shied away from such exposure - particularly of junior staff"".
mmittee, chaired by Julian Lewis MP, also revealed there had been tensions over the agencies' ability to meet deadlines when providing information to the parliamentary watchdog overseeing their work.
mmittee said it had been ""severely hampered over the past year by the failure of the UK Intelligence Community to provide responses to the committee in accordance with the deadlines set"". 
It said that in its 2019-21 annual report, it had put delays down to the agencies' reduced resources during the pandemic, and their need to focus on immediate national security threats. 
""However this is no longer a credible explanation,"" it said.
report called this a ""serious issue"" which it said prevented the ISC from ""effectively performing its statutory oversight role"".  
However, in a press notice accompanying the annual report, the committee said it had been reassured that the head of the intelligence agencies ""appear to have recognised the need to address this situation and (the committee) trusts that they will now take action to improve their responses"".
But the report added there had been an ""erosion of oversight"" because of a growing number of intelligence and security activities carried out within units of government departments that the committee did not have oversight of.
report named units including the Investment Security Unit in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; the Telecoms Security and Resilience Team in Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS); the Office of Communications in DCMS; the Counter Disinformation Unit in DCMS; the Transport Security, Resilience and Response Group in the Department for Transport; the Intelligence Policy Department in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office; and the Joint Biosecurity Unit in Department of Health and Social Care.

Referendums (Supermajority) Bill was brought forward by North Antrim MP Ian Paisley on Tuesday.
would apply across the country including any future united-Ireland vote or a Scottish referendum poll.
At present, such referendums would require a majority of 50% plus one.
However, the Alliance Party has branded the bill a ""stunt"" and said it ""would never be debated"".
Speaking on the BBC's Nolan Show, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley said the bill ""addresses the issue of major constitutional change"".
""This is about making sure that there has to be stability in that process,"" he said.
""You can't just have a crisis that moves a divided territory into another divided territory.""
According to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, there would be no change to Northern Ireland's constitutional status without the consent of a majority of people of Northern Ireland.
However, Mr Paisley said a weighted majority of more than 50% plus one in a referendum would show ""overwhelming consent"".
upport of DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Mr Paisley added. 
But the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MP Claire Hanna said the bill will ""never be debated"".
Ms Hanna said it was ""essentially just a trolling exercise from someone who has decided against being a serious political actor"".
Alliance Party MP, Stephen Farry, described the bill as a ""stunt"" which will ""never be debated, never mind voted upon in Parliament"".
""This is going absolutely nowhere,"" he told BBC News NI.

politics	Liberal Democrats eye blue wall seats in wake of Tory turmoil	"It can be hard for the Liberal Democrats to make themselves heard at the best of times, but recently the party has been particularly unlucky. 
For two years running the Lib Dems have been unable to gather in person for their annual conference, while other parties' events went ahead - robbing them of a guaranteed moment in the media spotlight. 
ftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 and the death of the Queen this year left them with little choice but to cancel the biggest event in their calendar. 
weekend, party leader Sir Ed Davey is touring Lib Dem target seats and will make a speech in London in an attempt to renew his offer to voters. 
But languishing a distant third in opinion polls and with only 14 MPs, where does the party sit after months of political turmoil at Westminster?
Party insiders point to a run of by-election wins and bold policy pitches as proof the Lib Dems are able to punch above their political weight. 
A surprise victory in the Conservative seat of Chesham and Amersham in June 2021 was followed by wins in other Tory strongholds - North Shropshire later that year and Tiverton and Honiton in June. 
Liberal Democrats hope to replicate this across the so-called 'blue wall' of Conservative-held seats with more affluent and higher educated populations that voted largely to remain in the EU. 
f the list is Wimbledon, where the party lost by just 628 votes in 2019. The Lib Dems report plenty of anti-Conservative sentiment on the doorstep in the leafy south London enclave which returned a Labour MP in 1997 but has been held by the Tories since 2005.
One campaigner was told by a life-long Conservative voter they regretted supporting the party in 2019 and were ""ready for change"", summing up similar sentiment from others.
But conscious of becoming pigeon-holed as a political refuge for liberal Conservative voters fed up with the direction under Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak, the Lib Dems are keen to stress their electoral ambitions extend beyond the south of England. 
In Greater Manchester, for example, the party is looking to build on second place finishes in 2019 in Cheadle and Hazel Grove, where it recently took control of Stockport Borough Council in this year's local elections. 
Sir Ed Davey celebrates his party's win in the Chesham and Amersham while breaking down a model blue wall
Common among the party's target seats is a high proportion of home ownership, leaving voters in these areas exposed to the impact of recent interest rate rises. 
Recent polling conducted on the party's behalf suggested a majority of Conservative voters blamed the government for rising mortgages, compounding the Lib Dems' message that the blue wall is being ""hit hardest"" by the knock-on effects of an increase in interest rates. 
In the aftermath of the tax-cutting mini-budget delivered by Kwasi Kwarteng in September, a  poll found two thirds (68%) of people who had voted Conservatives in 2019 said the government would be to blame if mortgage bills subsequently increased. 
f 2,240 adults aged 18+ was conducted by Savanta ComRes between 30 September and 2 October.
Sir Ed Davey is expected to make a call for homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage to be better protected in a speech to party activists in London on Sunday. 
Lib Dems hope the move will influence the political debate around an issue facing millions of voters in a similar way to the party's calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and an energy price freeze this winter. 
Similarly, the party hopes to capitalise on a sense of frustration among voters that key public services are ""broken"", as one senior party figure put it, with their call for guaranteed GP appointments within a week in England. 
Eye-catching policies may gain the Lib Dems some attention and allow them to punch above their political weight, but their prospects at the next election may have as much if not more to do with the fortunes of their opponents as it does their own offering. 
Senior Lib Dems considered the Conservatives to be vulnerable on the economy while Boris Johnson was prime minister and sought to ""hammer home"" the impact of the rising cost of living. 
urmoil that marked Liz Truss's time in No 10 may have fuelled their attacks on government incompetence, but will the same tactics work against the new man in charge?
Lib Dems claim not to be fazed by Rishi Sunak as prime minister, citing what they see as his slowness to act as chancellor on the cost of living crisis and controversy around Suella Braverman's re-appointment as home secretary as potential weak points. 
Labour's lead in opinion polls has widened as popularity plummeted for the Conservatives, but the Lib Dems' standing has remained largely stagnant. 
Some in the party argue that anti-Conservative sentiment can only be a good thing for the Lib Dems and increase the party's chances of unseating Tory MPs at the next election. 
Furthermore, insiders claim Labour's apparent popularity among voters helps the party too, removing the 2019 ""fear factor"" of a Jeremy Corbyn government which may have prevented some Conservative voters switching to the Lib Dems in blue wall seats. 
Sir John Curtice, president of the British Polling Council, said the Liberal Democrats would ""probably pick up Labour voters in places where they're second"".
But he added that the economy was ""never ever their strong point"" and voters may struggle to identify the party's position on major issues. 
""I'm just not sure enough people know what the hell they stand for,"" Sir John said. 
may not worry the Lib Dems as much as it might. 
At the 2019 general election the then party leader Jo Swinson touted herself as the UK's next prime minister and talked of winning ""hundreds of seats"". 
Her successor is unlikely to make a similar pitch, instead seeking to make the most of hostility towards the Conservatives and argue that electing Liberal Democrat MPs in seats where Labour is unlikely to win is the only way to remove them from government. "	/news/uk-politics-63514048

politics	Tory MPs weigh up prospect of another five years in Parliament	"Conservative party has asked all of its MPs to say by 5 December if they are planning to stand again at the next election. 
While former PMs Boris Johnson, Theresa May and Liz Truss have indicated they'll contest their seats at the next election, the deadline has led to a number of Tory MPs going public to say they won't - including a few surprising names.
It's led to speculation that the party is facing an exodus.
A Conservative party source claimed the significance of the resignations was being ""overhyped by the media"".
So how does it stack up?
So far, 14 Conservative MPs have said they won't stand out of 357.
mpares with 12 for Labour, which has 195 MPs. The party has not given Labour MPs a deadline to say whether they are planning to stand down.
re are, though, some clear differences between the parties.
Most of the Labour MPs who've already said they're going are older, with five of them over the age of 70.
In the last few days, several younger Conservatives have also said they are quitting including Sajid Javid, who's 53; Chloe Smith, who's 40; William Wragg, who's 34 and Dehenna Davison, who's 29.
Matt Hancock, 44, who was a Conservative until being suspended by the party, has also announced his decision to quit Parliament. 
Many of these are MPs who would still be expected to have a decent political future in Parliament.
Many of them have given personal reasons for leaving the Commons.
Ms Davison, who became one of the party's rising stars after winning the former Labour seat of Bishop Auckland in 2019, said she hadn't ""had anything like a normal life for a 20-something"".
Others have said the job is becoming harder; Sir Charles Walker, who is stepping down at the next election, said the political environment had become ""toxic"".
A Conservative MP elected in 2010, who is standing again, said he sympathised with those who weren't as the job had changed in the last decade and, while a privilege, was ""exhausting"".
former Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told BBC Radio 4's World at One that too many conclusions were being drawn from a ""still relatively small number of resignations"" and suggested turnover would be a good thing.
""You don't want to have a whole cadre of professional politicians who get in at 20 and remain until they're 80. That would be a very, difficult form of politics that I don't think the country would like,"" he said.
It's still very likely that more MPs will follow their colleagues out of the door after this week.
In 2019, 74 MPs stepped down from across the Commons.
December date is not a hard and fast deadline which would commit Tory MPs to going through with standing again.
At least one MP who is expected not to run again at the next election hasn't told the party yet.
With polls where they are, it's quite difficult to find a Conservative MP who is optimistic about the Tories' chances of winning the next election.
's been leading some to consider if they would want to return in opposition, even if they think they will hold their seat.
John Strafford, chairman of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy, also suggested MPs were having to deal with party members who were angry and demoralised.
""I think everybody now realises that the party is going to lose the next general election,"" he said.
""It is, in my view, going to be a pretty severe loss.""
Add into to all of that the fact that the next election will be fought on new boundaries, some of which will mean MPs having to establish themselves in new areas.
umbers may not quite count as an exodus yet but there is certainly a real threat that one could develop."	/news/uk-politics-63862144

politics	Climate: Wales to set up publicly-owned renewable energy firm	"Plans to set up a new publicly-owned renewable energy company have been announced by the Welsh government.
UK first and will help tackle both the cost of living and climate crises, the Labour-run government said.
Ministers added that energy profits could be ploughed back into local communities. 
Opposition parties meanwhile called for the new organisation to get up and running quickly.    
Initially the new company - which is yet to be named - will focus on developing windfarms on Welsh government-owned woodland.
It would be modelled on other state-owned firms currently operating in Wales.
For instance, the largest onshore windfarm in Wales, Pen y Cymoedd between Neath and Aberdare - which is also bigger than anything similar in England - is run by an offshoot of the Swedish government.
While the schemes deliver land rent, jobs and sizeable community benefit funds, the profits are ultimately shipped back to their respective countries, rather than being reinvested in Wales.
Speaking in the Senedd, Climate Change Minister Julie James said she wanted to ensure energy profits generated in Wales delivered ""greater benefit"" for local people.
Funds could be used for initiatives such as better energy efficiency measures like home insulation for communities living near the new windfarms, she suggested.
""If other countries are anything to go by, then we should expect considerable returns from our investment,"" she said, describing the plan as a ""truly historic moment for Wales"".
""We are the first in the UK to set up a publicly-owned renewable energy developer. This is a long-term sustainable investment that puts net zero and the communities of Wales at the heart of the transition we need.""
m is for the new company to be set up by April 2024, with the first projects achieving planning consent towards the end of the decade.
Ms James said the new firm would also work with community-based and commercial energy developers to work on joint ventures.
Meanwhile a separate organisation is being set up as part of the Labour-run administration's cooperation agreement with Plaid Cymru to drive forward small-scale community energy projects.
Welsh government woodland estate covers 6% of Wales and is largely made up of hilly, windy sites.
Renewable energy firms have been encouraged to develop on this land in recent decades, with four projects totalling 441 megawatts (MW) worth of onshore wind installed since 2005, and a further 134 MW still in development.
government said its new state-owned developer would help deliver its aim of securing more than 1 gigawatts (GW) of locally-owned generation by 2030, enough to supply approximately 750,000 homes.
re similar to those announced by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer last month for ""Great British Energy"", though the Welsh government said its proposals have been in development for several years.  
Welsh Conservative spokesperson on climate change Janet Finch-Saunders MS questioned whether the new organisation could get up and running more quickly than April 2024.

politics	Autumn Statement: Five things to look out for	"Jeremy Hunt says he wants to make sure any recession is short and shallow
Autumn Statement is the defining moment of Rishi Sunak's premiership - and one that could have a profound effect on our lives.
He and his Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, say they want to restore the UK's financial credibility.
want to restore the Conservative Party's credibility with the voters.
first step was to rip up the plans of their predecessors, Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng.
Now they have to show us their plan to get the country through a cost-of-living crisis and a looming recession.
Here's what to look out for when Mr Hunt makes his statement on Thursday.
What a turn around. Previous chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled big tax cuts, with the promise of more to follow.
Not only has Jeremy Hunt scrapped all that, but he is looking for ways to raise another £20bn from taxes.
One way to do that is to freeze the thresholds between income tax bands - and to freeze them for a longer period of time.
means as wages go up more people will find themselves in higher tax bands.
It is unlikely to be popular with Conservatives who hope to convince voters they are a low-tax party at the next general election.
x rises won't be enough to close a gap in the UK government's finances, so Mr Hunt is expected to also rein in spending.
Financial markets were spooked by Kwasi Kwarteng's uncosted plans, so Mr Hunt wants to show them he will balance the books.
Departments in Whitehall will be told to live within their means. Because of the way it is funded, that means the Welsh government, which holds the purse strings for most of Wales' public sector, is unlikely to get much extra cash.
And cash is what we need, say Mark Drakeford and his ministers. Wales' funding increased significantly last year. But soaring inflation has wiped out a lot of the value of the budget 
's why Labour and Plaid Cymru warn about another era of austerity, similar to the Cameron-Osborne era in the 2010s when spending was slashed after the financial crisis.
Commentators think this could be the most difficult conundrum facing Mr Hunt.
If public services do not get extra funding, how are they going to pay staff the wages they need to cope with rising costs?
Put simply, they can't. Something has to give. Either money is cut from somewhere else or employees face a cut in living standards.
major headache for the Welsh government. Nurses in Wales have voted to go on strike after below-inflation pay offers. Teachers in Wales are being balloted on industrial action too.
Wales's finance minister Rebecca Evans will publish her budget on 13 December. 
xtent to which she can fund pay rises for nurses, teachers and other public sector staff will, in large part, depend on what Mr Hunt says in the Commons.
More than 600,000 people in Wales get the state pension. Around 60,000 receive out-of-work benefits.
r fate has become a key test for the values of this Conservative government.
Should they go up in line with inflation (which, if you've read this far, you will know is very, very high) or should they be held down to save the Treasury some money?
It looks very likely Mr Hunt will inflation proof benefits and pensions. If it doesn't he can be assured of facing a lot of criticism, including from his own party.
Liz Truss committed to help people with eye-watering gas and electricity bills for two years.
But Mr Hunt changed that. 
xisting energy price guarantee - which means a typical household pays no more than £2,500 a year - will finish in April, when it will be replaced by a scheme that is targeted on the people in greatest need of help.
Mr Hunt says his replacement scheme will cost the taxpayer ""significantly less"" - which means some consumers will probably pay more."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63648827
politics	Solar farms 'vital' part of renewable energy mix, say Norfolk campaigners	"Energy from the sun is a key part of the renewable energy mix but some think solar farms should not be built on farmland, BBC Politics East reports.
Recently the then Prime Minister Liz Truss suggested agricultural land used for food should not be used for solar power. 
But environmentalists have told the BBC that solar farms are vital to reduce carbon emissions.
A 200-acre (81-hectare) scheme has been approved at Bloy's Grove near Norwich.
r farm off Brick Kiln Lane, between Mulbarton, Newton Flotman and Swainsthorpe, is expected to generate enough energy to power 14,000 homes.
Ann Chandler, of Swainsthorpe Parish Council, said: ""The land [at Bloy's Grove] has been used for growing crops for hundreds and hundreds of years, so we are extremely worried about it and upset about it. 
""It's not good for our future food security. We've been told we need our food security to be self-sufficient. 
""In France they are putting solar panels high above their car parks, such as supermarket car parks.
""We should think outside the box a bit more and not use our prime land.""
EDF renewables, owned by the French state - which is behind the project, is currently building two other solar farms in the region with more in the pipeline.
Ben Fawcett, the firm's head of solar, said: ""Farmers get a guaranteed income. If they know they can get a secure income, that also allows them to invest which potentially means their other land becomes more productive. 
""So I don't think it is necessarily a direct conflict between food security and energy security and I think the Ukraine crisis has reminded us of the importance of energy security."" 
Current government policy on solar generation is unclear. 
Six months ago a target to increase it five-fold was announced, then last month the then PM and South West Norfolk MP Ms Truss appeared to move away from solar farms.
""I very much support the use of solar panels on commercial buildings - I thinks that's great - and on homes,"" she said.
""But what we shouldn't be doing is using productive agricultural land, that could be producing food, for solar energy.""
Michael Rayner, Norfolk spokesman the countryside charity CPRE, said solar farms were ""a quick fix"" leading to ""quick profits"", but not the answer to providing solar power.
""In 2014, there was a report that showed there were 250,000 hectares of commercial south-facing roof-space where we could put solar and that doesn't include domestic roof space or brownfield [urban] land,"" he said.
Asher Minns, the executive directive of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, based at the University of East Anglia, said the land taken up by solar farms was a quarter of that used by golf courses. 
""We need solar on land and... on roofs and new-build roofs and new-build businesses,"" he said.
""There have to be proper building requirements that if you are building a new building you need to put solar panels on the roof. We need clean electricity going into the 21st Century.""
A Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesman said: ""Protecting our environment, backing British farmers and delivering long-term energy security with more renewables is at the heart of the government's manifesto.
""We will be working closely with farmers, land managers and environmental groups as we look at ways to improve our future farming policy so that it...  supports our thriving food and farming sector.""

Rishi Sunak has ""failed"" his first electoral test as Labour held Chester in a by-election with an increased vote share, Angela Rayner has said.
Labour's deputy leader said voters ""have given a big message to the Conservatives that they want change"".
Samantha Dixon was elected with a 10,974 majority, and a 61% vote share - Labour's best ever result in the seat.
Repeating the 13.6% swing from the Tories nationally would win Labour a majority, pollster John Curtice said.

Labour had been expected to retain the seat, which it won in 2019 by a majority of 6,164. 
In that election, the Conservatives came second, winning 38% of the vote. Labour and the Liberal Democrats secured 50% and 7% respectively.
me around, Ms Dixon won with a 61% share, easily defeating Conservative Liz Wardlaw on a 41% turnout.
Very little about this result is surprising, but that doesn't mean it's not significant. 
Labour held the seat and boosted their share of the vote, while support for the Conservatives dropped. 
Sir Keir Starmer can point to this win as evidence that Labour's lead in the opinion polls is reflected in the real world. 
Conservatives say they've been given a ""bloody nose"", as is often the case for governments mid-term, and a message from voters that they need to deliver. 
Labour insiders are talking up the win as a ""thumping result"", with the party's biggest ever majority in the city of Chester.
But Tories in the region, braced for defeat, say with some relief that it could've been worse. 
It's always risky projecting by-election results onto the national picture - but as a snapshot, this one tells us Labour has built on its support in a seat that's been Conservative in the past and for the Tories, the electoral outlook is bleak. 
Sir John Curtice told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Labour are in a stronger position than they have been at any point in the last 12 years.""
13.6% swing from Conservatives to Labour would be enough for Labour to form a new government, Sir John said, but ""wouldn't produce an enormous majority"" were it to be replicated in a general election.
Labour's Samantha Dixon won the city's by-election, securing more than 61% of the vote.
was triggered by the resignation of previous Labour MP Christian Matheson.
He stood down after Parliament's watchdog recommended his suspension for ""serious sexual misconduct"".
Conservatives have performed badly in recent by-elections, losing Wakefield to Labour and the historically safe Tory seat of Tiverton and Honiton to the Liberal Democrats. 
feats increased political pressure on Boris Johnson, who later resigned as prime minister.
ursday's by-election was the first to take place since Mr Johnson quit and his successor Liz Truss caused market turbulence with her mini-Budget. 
Analysis
By Kaleigh Watterson, Cheshire political reporter
Even though it wasn't a completely unexpected result, people from the Labour Party here in Chester are very happy with a near 11,000 majority. 
Labour seat since 2015 and, out speaking to people on the streets, there were more people saying they were going to vote for them.
Labour campaign was a lot more active too. We saw a lot of shadow ministers coming to visit - big hitters like Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves and former leader Ed Miliband.
Sam Dixon - a former leader of Cheshire West and Chester Council - was keen to showcase her local links.
mattered - some of the candidates told me the first question asked of them was: ""Are you from Chester?"" 
With a Conservative candidate living in a neighbouring council area and minimal ministerial visits, the question can be asked: Did the Conservatives really have their heart in this one? "	/news/uk-politics-63825130
politics	Ukraine war: Rishi Sunak visits President Zelensky in Kyiv as he pledges £50m in aid	"Watch: Rishi Sunak meets President Zelensky in Kyiv for the first time as prime minister
Rishi Sunak has pledged £50m in defence aid to Ukraine as he met President Volodymyr Zelensky in his first visit to Kyiv since becoming prime minister.
Mr Sunak said it was ""deeply humbling"" to be in Kyiv and that the UK would continue to stand by Ukraine. 
""Since the first days of the war, Ukraine and the UK have been the strongest of allies,"" Mr Zelensky said following the meeting. 
kage is intended to counter Russian aerial attacks. 
£50m defence aid comprises 125 anti-aircraft guns and technology to counter deadly Iranian-supplied drones, including dozens of radars and anti-drone electronic warfare capability.
Mr Sunak also announced the UK will increase the training offer to Ukraine's armed forces, sending expert army medics and engineers to the region to offer specialised support.
It follows more than 1,000 new anti-air missiles announced by the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace earlier this month.
On his visit the prime minister saw captured Iranian-made drones which have been used to target and bomb Ukrainian civilians in recent months.
Mr Sunak also laid flowers for the war dead and lit a candle at a memorial for victims of the 1930s Holodomor famine, before meeting emergency workers at a fire station. 
rime minister said: ""I am proud of how the UK stood with Ukraine from the very beginning. And I am here today to say the UK and our allies will continue to stand with Ukraine, as it fights to end this barbarous war and deliver a just peace.
""While Ukraine's armed forces succeed in pushing back Russian forces on the ground, civilians are being brutally bombarded from the air. We are today providing new air defence, including anti-aircraft guns, radar and anti-drone equipment, and stepping up humanitarian support for the cold, hard winter ahead.
He added that it was ""deeply humbling"" to be in the Ukrainian capital and have the opportunity to meet people ""paying so high a price, to defend the principles of sovereignty and democracy"".
Mr Sunak's pledge to send more air defence support is exactly what President Zelensky would want to hear at a time when Russian airstrikes have destroyed nearly 50% of the country's energy infrastructure, according to the government in Kyiv. 
men's hopes for peace and a just outcome to the conflict may feel like distant prospects, but Mr Sunak's promise to hold a reconstruction conference for Ukraine next year in London will be good news for the government and companies, which desperately need access to international finance.  
During the visit, Mr Sunak also confirmed £12m for the World Food Programme's response to Ukraine, as well as £4m for the International Organisation for Migration. 
Downing Street said the funding would help provide generators and mobile health clinics, with the UK also sending tens of thousands of extreme cold winter kits for Ukrainian troops. 
Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey tweeted: ""The government continues to have Labour's fullest backing to support Ukraine, reinforce Nato allies and confront Russia's aggression.""
Ukraine has been requesting assistance from Western nations in recent months amid intense Russian aerial attacks on Kyiv and across the country.
Earlier in the week, Russia hit Ukraine with one of its biggest barrages of missiles yet, days after its troops were forced to withdraw from Kherson. 
Kyiv was hit and there were strikes across the country, from Lviv in the west to Chernihiv in the north.
k coincided with the G20 summit in Indonesia this week where, in a virtual speech, Mr Zelensky said he was ""convinced now is the time when the Russian destructive war must and can be stopped"".
While Mr Sunak was at the Bali summit, which was attended by Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, the UK prime minister urged Russia to ""get out of Ukraine"" and condemned the country for its ""barbaric invasion"".
He stressed the UK would ""back Ukraine for as long as it takes"". 
Britain is currently the largest provider of military aid to Ukraine aside from the US. So far the UK has committed about £2.3bn and has pledged to match that amount in 2023, according to the House of Commons library. 
UK is also hosting a programme which will aim to train 10,000 new and existing Ukrainian personnel within 120 days.
Mr Sunak's predecessor Boris Johnson previously met Mr Zelensky in Kyiv in June and August, and Liz Truss was also a vocal supporter of Ukraine. 
Mr Johnson became almost a cult figure in Ukraine, after he was one of the first international figures to publicly support Ukraine and send military assistance. 
It is a tough comparison for Mr Sunak to live up to so early on in his premiership. Many people in Ukraine do not know the new prime minister well and they will want to see how committed he is to supporting the country. "	/news/world-europe-63687045
politics	Rishi Sunak grilled over tax rises, spending cuts and small boat crossings	"Another trip, another prime minister.
I've been the BBC's political editor for six months, but this is the first overseas trip I've done where the prime minister travelling is the same as the one on my previous trip.
In June, I travelled with Boris Johnson to the G7 Summit in Germany and the Nato summit in Spain. In September, it was Liz Truss travelling to the United Nations in New York.
And then, last week, Rishi Sunak did his first foreign visit as prime minister, to the COP27 climate summit in Egypt.
I now type these words during a brief, middle-of-the-night refuelling stop in Dubai, ahead of another 10 hours in the air to Indonesia - and yes, Mr Sunak is with us as we head to the G20 summit in Bali.
Like many of us, he's changed out of his work clothes for something more comfortable - he's a fan of hoodies - for the long haul to the southern hemisphere.
G20 is an economic forum where the long haul of reviving the global economy, given the consequences of the war in Ukraine, will dominate.
And so the economy frames the prime minister's week: the international picture from Monday to Wednesday in Bali, and then - with a spot of jet lag, no doubt - the Autumn Statement in Westminster on Thursday.
All the political talk is about that statement, now in just a few days' time.
What many will see as a bad news budget is highly likely to provoke the kind of rows within the Conservative Party and beyond that we haven't yet seen during Mr Sunak's time in No 10 - rows about whether the prime minister and the chancellor have made the right calls.
Already some on the right, both on the Tory backbenches and among the Conservative-leaning newspapers, are arguing tax rises and spending cuts are un-Conservative and risk making a bad situation worse.
ravelling press pack got to ask Mr Sunak about this on the first leg of this schlep out to Indonesia.
It happened in what is called a huddle, where the prime minister comes to the back of the plane, we all crowd around and he takes questions from each of us for the best part of 45 minutes, on any topic we can think of.
I know what you might be thinking reading about a load of reporters flying to the other side of the world with the prime minister: is it a bit cosy?
Well, all I can say is having a couple of dozen sceptically minded reporters surrounding the prime minister and asking whatever we like, including follow-ups, for rather a while - and then dissecting every syllable afterwards - feels like close scrutiny.
So, what did he say about the tax rises and spending cuts that are coming?
He claimed it was his approach that had meant ""financial conditions in the UK had stabilised"".
was specifically because, he reckoned ""people expect the government to take the decisions that will put our public finances on a sustainable trajectory, and it's the government's job to deliver on that"".
g else could lead to chaos, is the thrust of his argument, one some on the left and the right would take issue with. 
But what he portrays as a necessity, others see as an economic choice.
re are Conservatives who think there should be more emphasis on spending cuts and less on tax rises, as well as a much greater focus on economic growth.
And there are the opposition parties who argue so much of what Mr Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt confront is a consequence of what they see as long term Conservative mismanagement of the economy.
r main thing worth mentioning as this trip gets under way is the issue of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats.
government is signing a new deal with France on Monday to try to stop people crossing in that way.
It will see the number of officers patrolling the French coast to try to stop people setting off rising from 200 to 300, with the UK paying France around £63m to fund it - an £8m increase on the current annual cost.
rime minister sought to emphasise to us how important he sees it - and how much of his own time it has taken up.
""I've spent more time working on that than anything else, other than obviously the Autumn Statement, over the past couple of weeks,"" he told us. 
g question is whether what is being announced will make a noticeable difference. Home Secretary Suella Braverman has acknowledged the situation was ""out of control.""
g test, then, is will these measures leave people with the impression the government is actually in control?"	/news/uk-politics-63619412

sports	Ben Bril: The Dutch Jewish boxing champion sent to Nazi camps by Olympic team-mate	"Sitting in his boxing gym just outside Amsterdam, former Dutch champion Barry Groenteman is reminiscing about the times he used to visit his grandmother. 
When she was living in a retirement home and he would go to see her, he'd often come across an older man ""who was always shadowboxing: in the hall, with the nurses"".
Groenteman continues: ""He'd show me his ring, with the Star of David on it. And my grandmother would whisper: 'That's Ben Bril.'""
For the young Groenteman, it was an introduction to a man who would have a huge impact on him and whose story he feels compelled to tell.
Like him, Bril grew up as Jewish boy in Amsterdam, and - also like him - boxing became his life.
But there the comparisons end. Groenteman was born in 1986. Bril was born in 1912. By the time he reached his 30s, his life had been transformed by invasion, violence and anti-Semitism. 
On Monday, the Dutch boxing world will come together to celebrate the return of the Ben Bril Memorial night, at Amsterdam's famous Carre Theatre. 
gathered will remember how a serial national champion was forced into hiding and then sent to the Nazi concentration camps by a former Olympic team-mate. They will look back on his remarkable survival and consider his legacy today - inside and outside of the ring.
Bril grew up in one of the poorest parts of Amsterdam as the second youngest of seven children. 
It was a tough upbringing, according to Steven Rosenfeld, who is a relative of Bril's through his wife Celia and has written a book about his life: Dansen om te overleven (A Dance with Survival). 
""They lived in tenements, he didn't sleep in a bed, he slept on straw, they didn't have a toilet, he had to carry buckets down to the street,"" Rosenfeld says.
For the young Bril, fighting was a part of daily life. There were scraps with friends of course, but also clashes with rival groups from different communities in the tightly packed city, according to Ben Braber, a historian who has written extensivelyexternal-link about Jewish life in Amsterdam during the inter-war years.
But while some of his friends carried on brawling, Bril turned his hand to sport.
""Boxing was very popular in the Jewish quarter before World War II,"" says Braber.
""For some boys, it was hard fist-fighting for gamblers, but other young Jews joined clubs. They were popular because the training and the matches were an escape from daily routine, also [from] daily poverty.
""And [the young men] built their self-esteem, because the art of self-defence requires courage, stamina, quick reactions but also technical skills.""
Bril was one of those young men, and his career sparked into life early when - at the age of only 15 - he was selected to fight for the Netherlands at the Amsterdam Olympics of 1928.
He turned 16 on the opening day of the Games (there are some suggestions he had to falsify his birthdate in order to qualify and was in fact only 15) and reached the quarter-finals in his weight class - flyweight. 
As he got older, Bril found work in a butcher's shop, and used his new job to help develop his sport.
""He told me that when he had to chop up meat he always used his left hand, even though he was naturally right-handed, to strengthen his left jab,"" Braber remembers.
Rosenfeld recalls Ben's ""brick-like"" hands, toughened, he was told, by dipping it into pickle brine.
rough the late 1920s and the 1930s Bril became a serial champion, winning eight Dutch titles and national fame.
But life in Amsterdam would change dramatically over those years - especially for Jews like him.
Economic crisis, the rise of Nazi Germany and an associated increase in anti-Semitism in the Netherlands made discrimination against Jews increasingly prevalent.
Bril experienced this directly when, despite his domestic success, he was left out of the Dutch team for the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. 
At the time, says Rosenfeld, he didn't fully understand what had happened, but it later became clear that he was blacklisted by anti-Semites on the Dutch national boxing committee.
Despite that, three years later in 1935 Bril claimed what, for him, would always be his greatest success - and the source of that Star of David ring he wore even as an old man.
He travelled to Tel Aviv, in what was then Mandatory Palestine, to take part in the second edition of the Maccabiah Games for Jewish athletes from around the world.
He and a fellow Dutch Jew, his friend Appie de Vries, both won gold medals and returned to a hero's welcome among the Jewish community in Amsterdam. 
It was at about this time that Bril started wearing the Star of David on his shorts, to match the ring he had won.
It is something of a tradition among Jewish boxers to wear the Star in that way and Bril was certainly not the first.
great 1920s American lightweight Benny Leonard, known as 'The Ghetto Wizard', did it in his heyday.
And, much later, as his own career took shape, Barry Groenteman would honour the man who inspired him by himself displaying the Star of David in the ring.  
For Braber though, Bril's act of identifying himself in that way, in 1930s Netherlands, is ""very significant"".
""He clearly identified himself as being Jewish, but he also wanted to be identified [by others] as being Jewish - that was an important matter to him,"" he says.
Right up to 1939, Bril was still wearing the Star in the ring, and handing out signed publicity photos of himself wearing those trunks.
Rosenfeld, who also interviewed Bril extensively for his book, says Bril's first motivation in wearing the Star was an expression ""of his sports accomplishment"" in winning at the Maccabiah, rather than a political statement.
But he was clearly well aware of the wider situation around Europe and wasn't afraid to act on his own initiative.
In 1934, Bril went with a Dutch Jewish group to compete in Germany.
Nazis had been in power for a year. The state had already begun to discriminate officially against Jews. The atmosphere was hostile and daily life was being made increasingly difficult.
Bril was appalled by what he saw. 
""We saw brown uniforms everywhere, swastika flags, the word 'Jew' on Jewish people's businesses,"" Bril told a Dutch newspaper many years later.
""I said then, as long as this regime is in power, I will never go to Germany.""
Despite his hurt at being overlooked for LA four years earlier, when the call came in 1936 for the Dutch champion to travel to Berlin for the Olympic Games, he turned it down.
As his amateur career continued and his fame grew, Bril married his wife Celia. They had a son - Abraham - and opened a sandwich shop in the city of Utrecht.
But their lives, and those of everyone in the country, were turned upside down by the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939. In May 1940 Germany invaded the Netherlands.
Initially little changed, but gradually life for Dutch Jews became more restricted, and increasingly under threat.
""In 1941, stricter regulations came in which were clearly an attempt to segregate the Jews in the Netherlands from the rest of the population,"" historian Braber says.
re were restrictions on which public spaces Jewish people could enter, and in particular an attempt to force bars and cafes to ban Jews from their premises, which often ended in violence.
rked the creation of a number of Jewish defence groups, some centred around the sports clubs like the one of which Bril was a member.
On 11 February 1941, Dutch Nazis marched into the Jewish district of Amsterdam.
A previous incursion two days earlier had resulted in attacks on Jewish homes and businesses, and there was a fear, says Braber, that synagogues would be the next target.
So the defenders - armed with bricks, metal bars, anything they could get their hands on - prepared themselves for another confrontation.
me it was even more violent and bloody, ""a ferocious battle"", says Braber, that resulted in the death of at least one Nazi and led to repercussions against the Jewish community.
Within two weeks some 400 men had been rounded up and deported - many survived no more than a few months.
Although Braber was told by a friend of Bril's that Bril was involved - and many men he knew certainly were, including his trainer and a number of fellow boxers - it is unlikely that the champion took part directly in the fighting.
Rosenfeld says Bril was told to stay away, because his fame might make him a target.
But the brief confrontation in Amsterdam's Waterlooplein square, with Jewish fighting groups at the core - ""a form of Jewish resistance unique in Europe,"" says Braber - was a stark demonstration of how life in the city had changed.
midation, violence and official discrimination continued to grow in intensity in the months that followed and in July 1942 - shortly after it became compulsory to wear a yellow star - came the first deportations of Dutch Jews.
""At that point virtually nobody in the Netherlands knew exactly what was happening in those camps where Jews were sent,"" says Braber.
""What we know now about gas chambers and extermination camps only became clear after the war. Nonetheless, some 20% of people who were called up [for deportation] didn't turn up, and went into hiding.""
umber included Bril and his family. As Braber points out, the decision to hide was a perilous one: ""'Can we stay together, can we get help, are these people trustworthy?' All these types of things you have to think about.""
According to Rosenfeld, the Brils were sheltered in a variety of different places and - despite the danger - were often out and about.
But eventually they were betrayed and held in custody - in a bitter echo of Bril's sporting life - by Sam Olij, who had been Bril's team-mate on the Olympic boxing squad of 1928. 
Bril had also boxed with Olij's sons in Amsterdam, but the Olij family had become committed Nazis. According to Dutch sports historian Jurryt van de Voorenexternal-link it was Olij's son Jan who arrested Bril and his wife and son.
Bril family were sent to the camps. First to Vught in the Netherlands, then - up by the German border in the north - to Westerbork, and finally to Bergen-Belsen, where it's estimated 50,000 people died, Anne Frank among them.
De Vooren has described Olij as ""a notorious Jew hunter"" who committed ""the worst kind of betrayal in Dutch sport"". After the war, he served nine years' imprisonment and died in 1975, while his son Jan was said to have fled to Argentina.
re is one moment that stands out from Bril's life in the war beyond all others. It was a moment fraught with danger, but one in which he acted instinctively. It came at the Nazi concentration camp at Vught, and we can hear about it through Bril's own words, because he told the story to Braber in the 1980s.
""A boy had attempted to escape [but] they caught him,"" said Bril.
""They placed him on a rack, and he was to get 25 lashes of a whip. Suddenly the commander called out: 'Boxer - step forward!'
""I had to carry out the punishment, but I refused. The commander said that if I didn't I would get 50 lashes, so I took the whip but when I hit him, I aimed to strike too high.
""The commander got mad: 'Not so!' he cried. He grabbed the whip and started beating like mad. I walked back to my line.""
Why Bril suffered no consequences for his refusal to carry out the order is not known, but those who witnessed it were under no doubt as to what they had seen.
""[Ben Bril was] the only man I saw during two and a half years in concentration camps - or heard of - who risked refusing to carry out a formal order of the SS,"" Braber quotes the head of Vught's Jewish administration as testifying after the war.
It was, says the historian, ""a very courageous act"".
But Bril would also have to fight in the camps, both in Vught and in Westerbork. As a famous boxer he was a target - someone who the guards might want to see in action.
In 1988, on Dutch television, Bril told of one life-changing moment. ""I boxed for my son, who was dying,"" he said. 
He was to fight against a 'kapo' (a camp inmate who was appointed by the Nazis to guard and control the other prisoners) in Vught.
man asked Bril not to knock him out. He replied that he would comply on condition that the man help him get medicine, and agree not to beat the inmates in his block.
Steven Rosenfeld says the man complied, and Bril's son overcame his illness.
Bril also helped organise fights which were staged for the entertainment of the camp authorities. Those taking part might have got extra rations or other benefits, according to Braber.
Groenteman made a powerful television programme about Bril's story and recalls being shown, by a former inmate, the papers detailing some of the fights in Camp Westerbork.
""I saw such a lot of names I know, I know their grandchildren,"" he says.
""The scariest thing was that they were so similar to the schedule papers that hang in changing rooms now, when I'm going to an amateur event with my guys. That was hard.""
Almost all of Bril's extended family died in the Holocaust, but his son Abraham and his wife Celia survived the war along with him. 
In January 1945, from Bergen-Belsen, the family were included in a prisoner exchange that saw them taken first to Switzerland, then to a United Nations camp in Algeria, before making it back to Utrecht.
Bril didn't return to the ring as a fighter after the war, but he couldn't leave boxing. 
He became a senior official in the sport, acting as a referee and judge at fights around the world, all the way into the 1970s.
He went to the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964 (where he once again showed his character by leaping into the ring to protect a fellow referee who had been punched by a competitor), Mexico City in 1968 and Montreal in 1976.
He missed the 1972 Games in Munich, and its own tragic story, only because of a dispute with the boxing authorities in the Netherlands.
Ringside or on the canvas, he played a small role at the start of the careers of some of the greats, officiating in fights involving world champions Joe Frazier, George Foreman and Sugar Ray Leonard.
Bril died in 2003 at the age of 91. The first memorial night in his honour was held four years later. 
Groenteman made his first appearance at the Carre at the 2011 event. He fought with the Star of David on his trunks, both to honour his family and the man who had inspired him as a youngster.
""I think that day I boxed the best fight in my whole career,"" he says.
""People get their strength from their religion, from meditation, from mindfulness, from where they come from. I always felt when I was boxing with the Star on my trunks, it gives me more power.
""We're raised up with the attitude: 'Never walk away from where you come from.' Ben Bril stood for who he was."""	/sport/boxing/63227822
sports	Sofia Goggia wins World Cup downhill in St Moritz despite two broken fingers	"Sofia Goggia returned from overnight surgery on broken fingers to win the second women's World Cup downhill race in St Moritz on Saturday.
Italian broke two fingers on the way to second place in Friday's downhill and travelled to Milan for an operation. 
She returned to Switzerland for Saturday's race and competed with her left hand taped to her ski pole.
""Yesterday it was broken, today it was already fixed,"" said the 30-year-old.
""I'm really happy today and I'm really grateful because it was not guaranteed at all that I could be at the start gate today.
""I have to say huge thanks to the people who helped me out here yesterday, from the doctor to the driver who brought me."" 
Goggia, the 2018 Olympic champion, raced with a plate and nine screws inserted in the left hand and also had holes cut into her glove as she claimed her 11th victory in the past 16 World Cup downhill races she has competed in and her 20th overall.
Her time of one minute 28.85 seconds saw her finish 0.43secs ahead of Slovenia's Ilka Stuhec with Germany's Kira Weidle a further 0.09secs back.

sports	Shaun Murphy: Ex-world champion opens up on reasons for 'life-changing' stomach surgery	"Shaun Murphy says reaching ""the bottom of my mental health"" convinced him to brave ""life-changing"" stomach surgery.
Former World, UK and Masters champion Murphy, 40, had a gastric sleeve operation during the summer.
rocedure involves removing a large part of the stomach, limiting the ability to consume excessive amounts.
""I just wish I had done it 20 years ago, because it does feel as if it's changed my life for the better,"" Murphy told BBC Sport's Framed podcast.
""I've struggled with my weight all my life. I was the fat kid in school, I feel like I've been dieting ever since I was 15, probably younger, and I just reached the end of my tether with it.
""I'd reached the bottom of my mental health, I was on the ground. I was very close to going to the doctor about depression, anxiety, not being able to go out, because I was getting shouted at in the street.
""On social media people were sending me horrific messages and comments and direct messages on Instagram and Twitter.
""And in the end I just thought, I need to do something about this, this is going to be the end of me, mentally and possibly physically.""
Murphy, one of only 11 players to claim snooker's illustrious 'Triple Crown' of World, UK and Masters titles, says he has shed four stone in the three and a half months since surgery.
""I can now eat whatever I want, but I can literally eat very, very little of it,"" he explained in his podcast chat with BBC Sport presenter Shabnam Younus-Jewell.
""I couldn't tell you the last time I finished a coffee as I can't physically take that much liquid in one go - if I sit there with a pint of Guinness, I'll still be sipping away at my first pint while everyone else is on their third.
""So I can still do all the same things. But whereas I would have eaten the whole packet of biscuits before and then been looking for a packet of crisps, that's me done.""
Essex-born potter, who was raised in Northamptonshire, says he elected for the drastic option of surgery after feeling like he had exhausted all other weight loss avenues.
""I've lost weight, gained weight pretty much consistently for the last 20 years and I've tried every diet going,"" Murphy added.
""I've tried being very cautious and careful in calorie counting, I've been to various clubs and saw success with those methods. 
""It was just always the maintenance of keeping weight off that I struggled with. When you're away on tour you're eating late, you're often eating rubbish, and I've just been unable to discipline myself.
""I just ran out of patience with it. At the World Championships this year I'd ballooned to nearly 20 stone, so I just knew I had to do something about it. 
""There are three or four types [of gastric surgery] - I wanted the most extreme one, the one that is irreversible. Because my stomach's now so small, it's highly unlikely I'll ever be able to physically consume enough calories in one go to put the weight back on.""
While he elected to have surgery for health reasons, Murphy, nicknamed the 'Magician', hopes his disappearing waistline can also help conjure up renewed success on the table.
Murphy has won nine ranking titles in his career - including the 2005 World Championship, where he burst on to the scene as a qualifier - but his most recent triumph was back in 2020 at the Welsh Open.
He did reach the 2021 Crucible final, losing to Mark Selby but, after being a top-10 mainstay for more than 15 years, is in danger of dropping out of the all-important world's top 16.
""An added bonus to that [the surgery] is that it is going to have a knock-on effect on all aspects of my life, including my career,"" Murphy added.
""From the basic point of being able to bend over the table better, being able to get lower to the shot. If you're carrying any extra weight that becomes quite difficult. 
""The Crucible this year was a classic example. It's quite a funny clip actually, in my match against Stephen Maguire, and I fouled the ball with my cufflink. But that was because I couldn't reach over the table.
""If you're backstage, listening to the MC waiting to be introduced and your shirt doesn't fit, your waistcoat and trousers are too tight, it just puts you in completely the wrong mindset.""
John Higgins and Mark Allen are among the players whose games have benefitted from weight loss in recent times and Murphy hopes the same will apply to him.
""Really the only target I've yet to achieve is getting to the top of the rankings, I've never been able to say I'm world number one,"" he added.
""I've got a pretty clean slate in terms of rankings for the next few seasons and if I can get my act together and start putting some balls in pockets again, I could start climbing the ladder."""	/sport/snooker/63373974

sports	NFL: Franco Harris, who made 'Immaculate Reception', dies aged 72	"Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris has died at the age of 72.
Harris won the Super Bowl four times with the Pittsburgh Steelers during the 1970s but was most famous for making the catch that became known as the 'Immaculate Reception' in 1972.
With the Steelers trailing at the end of a play-off game with the Oakland Raiders, a pass ricocheted to Harris and he ran in a game-winning touchdown.
In 2019 the play was voted as the greatest in NFL history.external-link
With 22 seconds left in the AFC divisional play-off on 23 December 1972, Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw attempted a throw towards John Fuqua but the ball bounced towards Harris, who stooped to catch the loose ball before charging down the sideline to claim a 60-yard touchdown.
Pittsburgh to a 13-7 win - their first in the play-offs - and although they did not reach the Super Bowl that season, Harris went on to help them become NFL champions four times in the next seven years.
Steelers are set to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Immaculate Reception on Saturday when they again host the Raiders, who are now based in Las Vegas, and Harris' famous number 32 will also be retired.
""We have lost an incredible football player, an incredible ambassador to the Hall and most importantly, we have lost one of the finest gentlemen anyone will ever meet,"" said Hall of Fame president Jim Porter.
Pittsburgh selected Harris with the 13th pick in the 1972 draft and he spent 12 years with the team before playing the final season of his career with the Seattle Seahawks in 1984.
A nine-time Pro Bowler, he ended his NFL career with 12,120 rushing yards and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990.
""Franco not only impacted the game of football, but he also affected the lives of many, many people in profoundly positive ways,"" Porter added.
""The Hall of Fame and historians everywhere will tell Franco's football story forever. His life story can never be told fully, however, without including his greatness off the field.""
Harris was the Offensive Rookie of the Year for 1972 and in 1976 he earned the NFL's Man of the Year award, which recognises a player's commitment to philanthropy and community impact.
In Super Bowl 9 in 1975, the Steelers beat the Minnesota Vikings 16-6 with Harris rushing for 158 yards, compared to just 17 for the entire Vikings team, to be named the game's Most Valuable Player."	/sport/american-football/64055339
sports	Greatest Fights: Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier brought heat, hate and hard soul searching	"""When I saw the punches being thrown, I said to myself they should abolish boxing because that was a killer fight.""
As Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier started throwing punches before 11am on a sweaty morning in the Philippines, Gene Kilroy had a closer look at the 'Thrilla in Manila' than most.
He stood in Ali's corner, shouted messages from ringside and later watched his friend and employer - who should have been celebrating - sit battered and bruised in his hotel room.
Ali simply said the 14 rounds felt ""like death"". Frazier, swollen and unable to see from his left eye, felt he hit his rival with ""punches that'd bring down the walls of a city"" and yet he was left contemplating defeat.
Kilroy, one of the only surviving figures from Ali's team on that morning in 1975, tells the Greatest Fights podcast the ferocity of what played out made him ""think"" about the nature of the sport.
Ali made some $9m (£4.4m in 1975), Frazier around $5m (£2.45m). The conditions ensured they earned every dime as estimated temperatures of 43C under the glass roof of the Araneta Coliseum served to all but cook both men.
""I made sure we had enough ice in the corner to keep Ali going,"" Kilroy recalls. ""The pillars in the venue were sweating it was so hot.""
Ali faced a different kind of heat in the build-up. His choice to introduce Veronica Porche as his wife to Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos prompted Khalilah Ali - his actual wife - to fly in and ""raise hell"" according to Kilroy. ""All hell broke loose,"" he recalls.
Kilroy had grown used to the ""challenge"" of chaperoning the most recognisable sportsman of his era.
""I had to chase them away - the hustlers,"" he says. ""Everyone wanted to haul Muhammad here or there and everyone had a gameplan. If Ali went to the bathroom he was the type of guy to come out with two new friends.""
While Ali had faced some turmoil, Frazier trained meticulously for a fight against a man he had grown to detest. Too much had been said - some of it deeply personal - across their two fights to date.
Each with a win to their name, the blows in fight three looked heavier than ever before. Frazier looked to sap Ali by working the body hard. A member of his team had simply instructed: ""Hit him on the hips, hit him on the legs. You hit him anywhere.""
Legend has it that seven rounds in, Ali whispered to his rival ""Joe, they told me you was all washed up"" to which Frazier snapped: ""They lied.""
""For me it is the greatest, most compelling rivalry in all of sport,"" says BBC Radio 5 Live Boxing's Mike Costello as he watches round eight, where the pair trade punches as if failure is simply not an option.
""Nothing matched what was involved with Ali and Frazier.""
A morning contest ensured some 68 countries would be able to tune in for the trilogy fight. Closed-circuit venues across America meant the fighters earned the money befitting of such occasion.
watching saw Ali begin to land with worrying regularity late in the fight. Frazier, spitting blood from his stool between rounds, took punches he simply could not see as his left eye closed more and more. 
And yet Ali is close to quitting. His reserves are depleted. In the 14th, he digs deep to produce one of the key attacks of his 21 years in the professional ring. It is enough to prompt decision in one corner.
""It's all over,"" trainer Eddie Futch told a protesting Frazier on his stool before the final round could begin. ""No-one will forget what you did here today.""
""Then everyone went in the ring and started jumping on Muhammad,"" says Kilroy. ""Some people said he fainted but he never did.
""We went back to the hotel room and watched TV. His hands were sore and his body was sore. Can you imagine taking a beating like that? Think how Frazier must have felt.""
""Two men who made and broke one another,"" BBC Radio 5 Live Boxing's Steve Bunce says as he reflects on the Manila night. ""I think it is the most gruelling fight I ever watch back.""
Ali died in 2016, aged 74. Arguably the most charismatic sportsman to ever live spent more than three decades battling Parkinson's disease.
When Kilroy met with Ali on his 69th birthday he recalls witnessing his friend shaking.
Kilroy adds: ""Then he whispered and said 'Gene, didn't we have a lot of fun?' 
""He said 'would you do anything differently?' I said no I wouldn't and he said 'me neither'. I have been blessed to be around him.
""You can't blame the disease on boxing. People said to him 'look what boxing did to you'. He said 'boxing made a lot of poor people a lot of money. When I fought everybody made money, I put a lot of people to work'. That's how he looked at it.""
Ali fought four times in a year after his third war with Frazier, a sign of the times in an era where heavyweight greats went to work in order to cement legacies.
Almost 45 years later, shoppers frequent the aptly named 'Ali Mall' next to the arena where he gritted out one of the sport's most captivating wins.
""It is the greatest heavyweight fight in my mind that we have ever seen,"" Costello adds.
Bunce replies: ""Sometimes we get accused of living in the past. When the past has fights like that, you have to live with them."""	/sport/boxing/53396927

""I remember the first day I came to watch... I just thought, 'wow!' 
""I had lost all my self-esteem and suffered from mental health problems. I had just had a child, was a lone parent and just wanted a sense of belonging.
""From the moment I met them, I never looked back and these girls have become my family.""
underlined by the support the women give each other off the court - they're a 'sport family' rather than just a team.
""Last weekend I did a speech at a ceremony so the girls came,"" says Sarah. ""Nisha does a lot of gospel choir concerts, so we'll go to those. 
""We like to support each other in whatever is important.""
Jo Adams hopes that sense of a 'second family' is something that will appeal to women considering getting back into the game.
""I think anyone that follows England through their journey will have that bug again,"" she says. ""People see the team and think, 'I want to have a go'.
""Some women have quite a nice life and they just want something a little bit extra. But there a lot of women who are really struggling with mental health issues... their social wellbeing isn't great.
""If you're a woman that's potentially struggling a bit, come along to a session.""
Sarah Pugh joined Bran Nu two years ago and says she has found a ""family away from my family"".
""You just fit,"" she says. ""It doesn't matter what you look like, who you are, where you come from, what you do, they're just so welcoming.""
Having not played since primary school, Sarah immediately felt comfortable in her new surroundings.
""Everyone is so encouraging - my skill level has increased massively. The team are motivating - they pick you up and push you, but in a good way. 
""I've dropped nearly two stone through netball. I'm still a big girl, and I'm still going, but this keeps me active, this keeps me fit, this is my release.""
rong bond between the players at Bran Nu has had a profound effect on their game. Unbeaten in the league and competing in the regional play-offs, the team are causing quite a stir in the netball community.
""I think our game is so tight because we know each other well,"" says Sarah Pugh. ""We're so comfortable with other and we trust each other.""
Goalkeeper Aliana adds: ""But we're not going to sugar-coat everything! When we want to win, we can be 'AARGGHHH!' But we all know its just banter and it's all love really.""
""Exactly,"" adds Joan, who at 55 is the team's oldest member. ""While we're actually playing, it's our ball and they know we're coming to get them! 
""People love that about our team - the passion is all over our faces.""
It is that passion that England Netball hopes to reignite after the success of the World Cup.
""We want international success, of course, because that success develops our role models and continues to make us a mainstream sport,"" says Adams.
""But I don't think it's only about winning. Netball is still very approachable, and we want to make sure that if people experienced it for the first time at the World Cup that they come back to watch more and, of course, play too.""
Still not convinced?
Nisha says: ""Get up, go, and forget your fears. Try it, have some fun and see where it takes you. There's a place for you and everybody you know at netball. Trust me."""	/sport/get-inspired/48690494
sports	Padel: First ever UK pro tournament begins in London	"first ever professional padel tournament held in the UK has begun.
London Padel Open, part of the Cupra FIP (International Padel Federation) Tour, is being held on 4-7 August at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton, south-west London.
Played in pairs on an enclosed court, the competition will feature both men's and women's events. 
Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) said it was a chance to ""move the sport forward"".
Former British tennis player Laura Robson will be making an appearance alongside her partner Sian Bayliss.
Other high profile players, including Tia Norton, Ricardo Martinez Sanchez and Jeremy Scatena, will also be in action.
game, described as a mixture between tennis and squash, is played in teams of two on a court that allows players to hit the ball after it bounces back off the wall.
Padel was invented in Mexico and is growing in popularity around the world, now being played in 90 countries by more than 20 million people, according to the Cupra IPF.
It also has been growing in popularity in the UK with 89,000 players and 200 courts, says the LTA.

sports	Grandad who earned karate black belt at the age of 74	"When Mike Mitchell started his journey through the karate belts at the age of 69, he found himself competing at events full of children.
He was many decades older than the other students, and during one grading he even considered leaving.
""I was surrounded by children who had higher grades than me and 50 parents watching from the balcony, and I felt like running away,"" he said.
But Mike forced himself to overcome his embarrassment - and has become the oldest man to obtain a Japanese Karate Association (JKA) black belt in Scotland.
""There was nobody there as old as me at the gradings,"" said the former PE teacher.
""I felt embarrassed that people were watching but didn't know who I was or why I was there.""
Now after five years and thousands of hours of training, the 74-year-old has achieved the first dan grade.
While there are older people with black belts, they achieved them when they were decades younger. No-one else has achieved a JKA black belt in Scotland while in their 70s.
Mike, who has three children and two grandchildren, lives in Haddington, East Lothian, with his wife of 52 years, Gloria.
He said he had been on ""an endless search to prove myself to myself"", with previous interests including mountain climbing and badminton.
""I would hope the next mountain climb, or badminton competition, would be my masterpiece,"" he said.
""But it wasn't until I got my black belt that I realised I had been released from this and that I had achieved my masterpiece.
""I had been fighting all my life to prove myself. I didn't know why I was doing it at the time, but now I feel like an inspiration to my family - and I feel relief.""
Mike was well into his 70s when he started training with brown and black belts.
""During one of the sessions I was fighting a black belt and suddenly I was on the floor and I couldn't breathe.
""I hadn't been winded since I was a child, but that is what it was. He had swept my front leg with his, and dumped me on the floor, end of fight.
""After that I started to change my fighting style.""
When he went for his black belt last month, Mike was told he might not be allowed to do the fighting part of the grading.
""They were concerned I could have a heart attack or get really beaten up due to my age,"" he said.
However, he begged his instructor to ask if he could fight and was allowed to do so - against an opponent who was about half his age.
Mike said his style had evolved since the earlier fight when he was winded.
""When someone attacks you, your instinct is to move back - but if you move in just at the moment they initiate an attack it can be very effective, particularly if you have long levers, which I have.
""So he stepped in, I stepped in and stopped him in his tracks. It happened twice more.
""I think he was getting what they were afraid I would get.""
When the contest was over, Mike had achieved his black belt - which he described as ""an extraordinary moment"".
He now plans to spend the next two years training for his second dan.
Paola Burrows, his instructor at the JKA Bass rock Club in Gullane, said Mike was ""a great fighter and an inspiration"".
""People think that if you go to enough lessons you will become a black belt, but it just doesn't work like that,"" she said.
""You have to prove you are worthy of a black belt and Mike did more than this at his first dan grading.
""He was up against an opponent much younger than him who was incredibly shocked when Mike stopped him dead several times."" "	/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-59294720
sports	Steve Borthwick: New England coach signals new era	"Sitting beside a new head coach as they faced the media at Twickenham on Monday, Bill Sweeney declared this was the ""launch of a new age of England rugby"".
Steve Borthwick's appointment, as Rugby Football Union chief executive Sweeney suggests, is about more than just a change of personnel.
With a new head coach, there is a new attitude and approach too. 
After years of Eddie Jones framing everything in the context of the 2023 Rugby World Cup, the tournament in France barely got a mention all day. 
Instead, there were other messages. Pride. Performance. Winning. Reconnecting a weary rugby public with its national team. Focus on the next game; nothing else matters. Turn the boos to roars. 
""I am privileged to be England head coach,"" Borthwick told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast, shunning his usual tracksuit to make a rare outing in a suit.
""I was the little kid who fell in love with the game watching the England rugby team play on the TV.
""This England team has incredible power, the power to inspire kids and the power to move people.""
Borthwick wouldn't look too far ahead; he refused to let the narrative drift even as far as England's second Six Nations match against Italy in mid-February, let alone the World Cup in September. 
""I want to maximise every minute that we have. The World Cup is just on the horizon, it is not far away at all,"" he added. 
""But I want to be really clear. That first game of the Six Nations, I want to us to be working for that game.
""Our responsibility is to make sure we play and fight and work, so our supporters can see how much our players care, and how much they are hurting about what has happened previously.""
RFU, which hitherto supported Jones and his 'World Cup or bust' policy, seems to have performed something of a 180 itself.
""The World Cup is not the entire focus,"" stressed Sweeney.
""We have fans who want to see us competitive in the Six Nations as well. A balance is needed.""
While Sweeney admitted this was never the masterplan, instead hoping Jones would hand over the reins to his successor along with the Webb Ellis trophy, he was adamant the decision to change head coach was made for the right reasons, at the right time, after five wins in 13 matches in 2022 and a poor autumn campaign. 
""The results were not what we expected,"" he added.
""Eddie is a tournament animal. But you make decisions based on your information. You sit down and analyse it and you make a decision whether it was the right thing to do. 
""We believe it was the right thing to do.""
But after previously supporting Jones' vision to build a World Cup-winning outfit over a number of years, the RFU's timing means Borthwick will have little time to make his mark. 
""The time is what the time is, it is neither short nor long,"" Borthwick said.
""We think there is plenty of time now for us to continue on our goal for the World Cup,"" Sweeney added.
wo weeks have been tough for Borthwick, as the RFU and Leicester negotiated both his contractual exit, and that of his right-hand man Kevin Sinfield. 
Straight and honest, Borthwick had been uncomfortable with constantly having to evade questions about his future while on Leicester duty. 
""It's been tough leaving that group of players,"" he added. 
""For the last two and a half years, they have come together and grown.
""I have asked them to work hard, and they have worked hard to try and achieve something special.""
Borthwick will have to hit the ground running, finalising his coaching team and his Six Nations squad by mid-January, and he warned against any England fans expecting overnight fixes. 
""We have got a lot of work to do. A lot of people have said we are behind other nations, and we are,"" he said.
""In 47 days' time when we play Scotland, we won't be perfect, but what everyone needs to see is just how much these players are going to fight for this team, and inspire this crowd so they are so proud of this team.""
Never one to bask in the limelight or make wild public pronouncements, Borthwick nonetheless struck an authentic tone throughout his first day in the job, while showing his lighter side as he recalled how one of his sons made it a condition he selected Wales' Tommy Reffell.
But after seven years of the highs and lows, ups and downs, fun and games, and smoke and mirrors of the Eddie Jones reign, it's clear the Borthwick era will be very different - ""calm and focused"", according to Sweeney. 
""Steve is his own man, he is extremely authentic and full of integrity,"" he said. 
""We just want to encourage him to be himself and I am sure that will be fine.
""We are absolutely confident Steve knows how to get his own message across.""
worked with Borthwick and Sinfield, have no doubt the pair have the attributes to revive the England side. 
""Steve will lay a plan out for you, with the right players involved, and it's a case of 'go do this, and we will win the game,'"" Leicester's Chris Ashton told Rugby Union Weekly. 
""As a player you think: 'Right, I can follow that.'
""Throw in there Kev Sinfield leading the defence and it is a recipe for success.""
As Borthwick repeated throughout his first day, the hard work starts now. "	/sport/rugby-union/64039136
sports	Dorset: Ironman 70.3 Weymouth will go ahead	"A major triathlon event will go ahead, organisers have confirmed.
Ironman 70.3 Weymouth will continue as scheduled on Sunday.
Several events across the country have been cancelled in recent days as a mark of respect to Queen Elizabeth II, who died last Thursday. 
Her state funeral will be held on Monday. Organisers of the triathlon event in Dorset said they shared their ""deepest condolences with the Royal Family"". 
But they confirmed that following consultations with local stakeholders and authorities it was decided to go ahead with the event.
A moment of silence will be observed at the swim start on Sunday, organisers said. 
""We further encourage athletes to pay their respects on race day, however they feel comfortable doing,"" they added in a statement. 
mpetition - which includes 70.3-mile (113.2km) and 140.6-mile (226.3km) routes - involves a swim in Weymouth bay, a run through the town and a cycle race through rural west Dorset.

sports	Britain's Phoebe Paterson Pine on struggling to deal with Paralympic gold success	"After winning archery gold at last year's rescheduled Tokyo Paralympics, Britain's Phoebe Paterson Pine knew she should probably have been on top of the world.
On her Games debut, aged 23, the Cirencester archer triumphed in the women's compound event - a sweet success after a lifetime blighted by name calling and struggles with her disability.
But the post-Games blues cast a shadow over the Briton who tried archery for the first time aged 12 on a family holiday.
""I struggled really quite bad mentally when I got back from Japan. I just didn't know who I was and what I was doing,"" she tells BBC Sport.
""People thought what I had done was amazing and I must be on cloud nine. But I just had days when I didn't want to get out of bed because I just thought what was the point? 
""It was almost like I was having an existential crisis. 
""Going to a Paralympics, you get lots of advice and workshops on things like anti-doping and media training. There isn't any guidance for what happens when you win a gold medal - and it's different for everyone.""
Paterson Pine took a break for a month, spending time with family and her boyfriend and indulging in another passion - knitting - but for someone who knows that shooting arrows has a positive effect on her wellbeing, it was difficult.
""I'm definitely doing better now than I was before,"" she says ahead of her return to competition at this week's World Archery Para Championships (19-27 February) in Dubai, where she aims to add a world title to her memorable Paralympic gold.
""I've started taking anti-depressants, which are really helping to mellow out the ups and downs a bit more. 
""I'm also working with a new coach [former world medallist Andrea Gales] who is very experienced and knowledgeable and so supportive. Working with her has completely changed my mindset, so I feel happier in myself.
""I also feel like I've made the right choice when I comes to starting my medication, because it's something I need to do and I'm glad I have done, because it's such a taboo topic.""
Paterson Pine's Tokyo gold was achieved the hard way. She missed the 2018 season because of a bone infection in her heel and struggled on her return in 2019 when the initial Paralympic qualification slots were secured.
After the coronavirus pandemic delayed the Games by a year, it gave her a fresh focus and she dealt with her mental health issues to secure a quota spot for Great Britain at the final qualification tournament in July, before then having to wait to see if the place was hers.
In Japan, she faced the challenge of four elimination matches in one morning in a sport where the smallest of margins can make a huge difference, going up against - and beating - GB team-mate Jess Stretton on her way to winning Paralympics GB's only gold in the sport at the Games.
Growing up with spina bifida which left her unable to run, school PE lessons were a particular challenge, coupled with frequent verbal abuse about her condition.
""I was always the last person to be picked on teams and if I didn't get picked I sat out. I hated it,"" she recalls. 
""I knew that people were going to say things about the fact that I couldn't run and someone else was going to have to run more to make up for that. Then I felt bad for those around me and that was wrong. 
""I have so many bad memories that I never thought I would ever take part in and enjoy sport.
""So to have found archery and gone to Tokyo and been successful, and also be awarded an MBE, proves that everyone who has ever said anything mean about my disability is just wrong. Look at what I have achieved - disability or no disability.
""I did an interview after Tokyo where I got very emotional over the fact that I have been called so many horrible names throughout my life.
""But of all the things I have ever been called, Paralympic champion is the best."""	/sport/disability-sport/60311232
sports	Snooker legend Ray Reardon at 90: 'Proud for Wales, proud for myself'	"As he celebrates his 90th birthday, former World Champion Ray Reardon says he is ""proud"" for Wales and himself as he reflects on an illustrious snooker career. 
Reardon won the World Championship six times in the 1970s and was the first player to be world number one when rankings were introduced in 1976.
""That's why I turned professional, to be number one,"" he says.
In the same year he was the Masters champion and among his other titles he won BBC's Pot Black twice, in 1969 and 1979.  
Born on 8 October, 1932 in the coal mining community of Tredegar, Reardon left school at 14 and followed his father Ben down the mine at Ty Trist Colliery. 
After pit closures in south Wales the family moved to North Staffordshire in 1956 and a year later Reardon had a terrifying experience at Florence Colliery in Stoke-on-Trent.  
While he was working underground the roof collapsed and he was trapped for three hours.
Reardon was hugely relieved his hands weren't damaged as he was rescued.
""When they came to rescue me they started shovelling and I thought if a shovel comes in it's going to hit my fingers and cut my fingers off,"" he recalls. 
""I was very worried about that, so as soon as I felt some freedom I wiggled my fingers, just to let them know I'm still alive because they didn't know.""
Reardon gave up mining and joined the police in 1960 before becoming a professional snooker player in 1967.  
ree years later he won the World Championship for the first time and he secured another five World titles in six years: 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1978, when he beat Perrie Mans in the final.  
was the only title he won at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield after the sport's biggest tournament moved there in 1977. In 1982 he lost against Alex Higgins in the final at the Crucible.
He was awarded the MBE in 1985 and Reardon retired in 1991, but in 2004 he helped Ronnie O'Sullivan to win his second World title, acting as O'Sullivan's coach and mentor.
""When I saw him at the table on the first day I was picking the balls up for him, it was something special, without doubt the best player I'd ever seen,"" says Reardon.
O'Sullivan celebrated by wearing a pair of false teeth as a light-hearted tribute to Reardon who was nicknamed 'Dracula' because of his prominent teeth and dark 'widow's peak' hairline.  
wo are still in touch and Reardon describes their relationship as ""pure friendship"".  
He is also in no doubt that the current World champion, who equalled Stephen Hendry's record of seven World titles in the modern era this year, can beat that record.
In 2016 the Welsh Open trophy was renamed the Ray Reardon Trophy in his honour and he presented it to Stuart Bingham in Cardiff the following year.  
Also in 2017 Reardon returned to the Crucible to take part in a parade of players who had won the World Championship there for a ceremony marking 40 years of the event being held in Sheffield. 
""It was wonderful, heart-warming,"" says Reardon. 
""It's easy to respond to that when you get such a warm welcome. I loved it.""
Reardon still plays snooker - ""very badly,"" he jokes - and, with the same smile that captured the hearts of millions of people who watched him dominate the sport in the 1970s, he feels very fortunate to be in such good health at the age of 90.
""I had a hip operation recently. I've got a bit of a limp, but other than that I feel fine. How lucky is that?"""	/sport/snooker/63158271
sports	Super Bowl 2022: Meet the star-studded Rams roster set to face the Bengals	"After 29 years away, the NFL's championship game is returning to the glitz and glamour of Los Angeles.
And with Super Bowl 56 taking place in their very own SoFi Stadium, the Rams went all in to make sure they were part of the big show.
In the six years since the franchise returned to LA from St Louis, they've built a star-studded roster which befits Tinseltown and their shiny new stadium.
And the gamble has paid off. They face the Cincinnati Bengals in Sunday's title decider and British defensive end Jack Crawford will be part of BBC Radio 5 Live's commentary team in LA.
""Part of me wants the Bengals to pull it off, it'd be huge for the team, the city and the fans,"" he said. ""But I can't bet against Aaron Donald.
""Now that Tom Brady's retired, I think he's the best player in the NFL, across all positions. In a game like this, where there's so much tension, I've got a feeling he'll take the game over.""
Here Crawford, who was unable to play for the Arizona Cardinals last season because of injury, introduces the big names looking to secure the Rams' second Super Bowl win.
Drafted by the Rams in 2014, Donald's a three-time Defensive Player of the Year and helped LA reach Super Bowl 53, where they lost to the New England Patriots.
Donald is on the small side for a defensive tackle but uses his physical ability to get past opponents and get after the quarterback. He now has 102 career sacks, with 14 overall this season.
""A lot of people have speed, strength, explosiveness or flexibility, but he has it all,"" said Crawford.
""He's as strong as anybody in the NFL, his hands are very accurate and he plays with leverage - to get under offensive lineman's pads [and get past them].
""Being a defensive lineman, I understand how hard it is to do what he does consistently, when teams are trying to take him out of the game - yet he's still the league's most disruptive defensive lineman.
""In the defensive-line room, when the coach put on Aaron Donald's tape, we used to say 'what's the point of watching this? He's just a different type of human.'""
In November the Rams traded two picks in this year's draft to sign Miller from the Denver Broncos.
raft pick in 2011, he was named the game's Most Valuable Player as he helped Denver win Super Bowl 50. He already has five sacks from eight games with LA.
""He's similar to Aaron Donald in that he's the complete package,"" said Crawford.
""In the defensive-line room we talk about 'bending the corner' - when a defensive end is rushing the quarterback and forcing the offensive tackle back, how low can the linebacker stay while running at an angle towards the quarterback?
""That makes it harder for the offensive lineman to get his hands on you, and that's something Von Miller does better than anybody. He has the balance to stay low to the ground, bending his body while running full speed.""
Rams gave up two first-round picks to sign Ramsey from the Jacksonville Jaguars early in the 2019 season.
He's remained a Pro Bowler each year and in the regular season he tied his career-high for tackles and interceptions.
""Some defensive backs you'll never see in the weights room, some aren't even among the fastest players on the team,"" said Crawford.
""But their instincts are on another level, and Jalen Ramsey's ability to cover receivers is natural.
""The best DBs secure tackles and make sure they bring the receiver down, and he's a good tackler. He's physical but has finesse at the same time.""
In March 2021, the Rams decided to move on from Jared Goff and traded him and three early draft picks to the Detroit Lions for Stafford.
After being 2009's first draft pick, Stafford had used his big arm to quietly rack up 45,000 passing yards while seldom threatening the play-offs.
Now surrounded by elite talent, he tied for a career-high 41 touchdown passes before claiming his first play-off win - after 186 NFL games - and leading a game-winning drive at Tampa Bay.
""He's a pocket passer and a momentum quarterback,"" said Crawford. ""Once he gets into a rhythm he can gas the defence, and he has a lot of weapons in this offence.
""He's proven he can take control of a game and get wins. I can't overstate how hard it is to get a quarterback who's consistent, knowledgeable, and can relate to every player on the offence.""
Kupp was unheralded when selected with 2017's 69th draft pick but Stafford's arrival has resulted in a breakout season.
Kupp was named the Offensive Player of the Year after earning the triple crown of most receptions (145), most receiving yards (1,947) and most receiving touchdowns (16).
""Sometimes you get an unassuming receiver who isn't in the spotlight at the beginning but over time their stats speak for themselves,"" said Crawford.
""He reminds me of Cole Beasley or Julian Edelman, a consistent receiver with sure hands, and they bring another level of confidence to the quarterback.
""You get these dynamic duos and once they warm up, it opens up opportunities for everybody else on the offence, including the running game.""
Unlike Kupp, 'OBJ' has been a star since the New York Giants drafted him in 2014, with a one-handed touchdown catch in his rookie season going viral.
Since then, his career has been disrupted by injury, with a move to the Cleveland Browns not working out before the Rams signed him as a free agent in November.
He now has six touchdowns from 11 games for LA, including his first in the play-offs, and had his most receiving yards for more than two years in their NFC Championship win.
""I was in for that play [the one-handed catch], for Dallas at the Giants, and thought it was a [penalty] flag against him and a drop,"" said Crawford.
""I was like 'there's no way that's a catch', but then the crowd started going crazy. It was an unbelievable play and he practices those catches regularly.
""But he has great speed too. You can have a team backed up on third down then 'bang', it's a 60-yard touchdown because he can just outrun everyone."""	/sport/american-football/60335554

Italy needed to beat hosts Spain in the later contest to deny Ireland a semi-finals spot but that game ended 0-0.
Goals from Sarah Hawkshaw and captain Katie Mullan looked to have Ireland in control but the Koreans fought back.
Ireland's likely semi-final opponents on Friday are India.
Indians are ranked eighth in the world - five spots above the Irish - and won their last encounter between the nations when clinching a 1-0 victory in the pool stages at the Tokyo Olympics.
On the way to reaching the World Cup final in London in 2018, Ireland twice beat India as they secured a 1-0 pool stages win before edging them out in a shootout in the quarter-finals after a 0-0 draw.
India will secure a meeting with the Irish providing they avoid a heavy defeat against South Africa later on Thursday which would see them topping Pool B and setting up a semi-final with the Pool A runners-up.
""They'll be a really tough opponent but it's also a great opportunity,"" Ireland head coach Sean Dancer said of India.

sports	British Rowing: Governing body chair calls for 'open' category for trans athletes	"The chair of British Rowing has called on the sport's world governing body to create an ""open"" category for transgender athletes.
World Rowing currently allows an athlete who was male at birth to compete in the female category if their testosterone is below a certain level.
World swimming's governing body Fina established an open category in June.
Mark Davies said he had asked World Rowing if it would ""consider following Fina's lead"".
British Rowing has recently updated its policy for transgender athletes in line with World Rowing's guidance, but Davies said he ""shared concerns"" the rules as they stand are a ""threat to hard-fought-for progress"" in women's sport.
Most sports federations allow transgender women to compete in the female category if they reduce their testosterone for 12 months.
Research has suggestedexternal-link transgender women retain significant cardiovascular and strength advantages compared to female athletes, even after taking testosterone‑suppressing hormones for more than a decade.
Critics of transgender athletes' participation in some women's sports argue that gives them a disproportionate advantage to their peers and limits opportunities for women.
However, some argue there is not enough detailed research - and that sport should be more inclusive, with open categories criticised for being discriminatory.
""World Rowing is less protective of women's sport than some other international federations such as Fina, which has adopted a policy of having open and women's categories,"" Davies told the World Rowing Congress.
""Open is for anyone who went through male puberty - recognising that limiting testosterone levels fails to counteract the lasting impact of that.""
Earlier this year, triathlon became the first British sport to establish a new 'open' category in which transgender athletes will compete."	/sport/rowing/63154925
sports	The Ghost Runner: John Tarrant's story of triumph and tragedy	"Easter Monday, 1957. A heavy gloom settled over Doncaster as crowds gathered for the half marathon ending in Sheffield. 
rting area was swarming with race stewards, many carrying a photo of the man they had been instructed to stop at all costs. 
fficials he was a gatecrasher, a scoundrel who must be prevented from racing. To almost everybody else, he was a downtrodden champion battling injustice.
Runners now pressed forward as the start time neared. The local mayor raised his arm to the clouds and with the crack of his starting pistol, the race was under way. Seconds later, another sound ripped through the air.
A spectator huddled beneath a long coat and a large hat had thrown his disguise clear, revealing his racing attire as he jumped, numberless, into the race. The spectators thundered their approval, and the stewards flailed as he skipped around them to join the runners disappearing down the road.
John Tarrant's sporting career fused triumph and tragedy. One of Britain's finest long-distance athletes of the late 1950s and 1960s, he ran multiple world records but was denied his full share of glory by the stubborn authorities who banned him from racing. 
rrant wouldn't let them stop him. He was a dogged and brilliant competitor. A numberless outlaw. They called him the Ghost Runner.
Born in London in 1932 to parents John and Edna, Tarrant lived his early years in poverty but they were loving nonetheless. His brother Vic arrived in 1935 and, for a time, life progressed as childhood should.    
However, in 1940, with their mother's health failing and their father called up to man London's anti-aircraft batteries, the brothers were sent to Lamorbey Children's Home in Kent. There they would remain for the next seven years. 
A stark setting at the best of times, life at Lamorbey was intensified by the terror of the Blitz. It got worse for the Tarrant boys. Two years later, their mother Edna died from tuberculosis.
It wasn't until August 1947 that their father collected them. Recently remarried and with a new-born baby, he moved the family to the Derbyshire town of Buxton, on the edge of the Peak District. 
In this beautiful and savagely hilly landscape, the young Tarrant took to running with a stubborn zealousness that quickly consumed him. It became his catharsis. Soon he was known for a capacity to push himself further than most would even consider attempting.
""He used running as his psychological help,"" says Nicola Tyler, who is chair of the Ghost Runners running club in Hereford and was trained by Tarrant's brother Vic for many years. 
""After that kind of childhood, of course, you're going to be angry and rebellious.""
In 1949, aged 17, Tarrant took up boxing and participated in Buxton's inaugural fight night. He competed a further seven times over two years, earning himself a total of £17 - worth about £400 today. Full of heart but lacking much prowess, he quit the sport in 1951, blissfully unaware how damaging his inglorious stint as a professional boxer would turn out to be.  
Various manual labour jobs came and went, usually discarded in search of more time to run. Even on honeymoon after his marriage to Edith Light in 1953, Tarrant took along his training gear. With his weekly mileage quickly climbing, he'd set his sights on the Olympics - but first he needed to join a club.
British athletics in the 1950s was governed according to a moral standard supposedly inspired by the Ancient Greeks but which stank of inequality and exclusion.  
Held up as a symbol of integrity, amateur sports were not to be sullied by those who had ever received payment for competing. It was a rule which, as Britain clawed itself out of the wreckage of World War Two, disproportionately affected the poor. 
Most got round the issue by simply not disclosing any earnings, but Tarrant felt it only right to formally declare his boxing exploits when applying to join the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA).     
wo weeks later a letter arrived returning his six shillings subscription fee. He was informed that he was now banned from amateur athletics for life - including events such as the de facto British championships and trial races for Olympic selection. He bombarded officials with replies, pleading his case, but to no avail.
Driven by a burning sense of injustice, Tarrant and his brother Vic concocted a plan. Why not simply run unregistered in the AAA races? Not only would it allow him to compete, it might even spark a debate within the media. 
gs began badly, however. Various misfortunes meant they arrived late to race starts in Macclesfield and Leeds. Nothing was left to chance when Tarrant arrived in Liverpool for the city's marathon on 11 August 1956. 
After discreetly changing, he wound his way through crowds to the start line, the only man without a number.  
As the race began, he attached himself to the leading pack before bursting clear after 11 miles. Rarely one for finesse or race strategy, Tarrant would come with one gear - full throttle - and a relentless, almost reckless approach to competition.
In this case, his rookie exuberance held up until mile 19 when he was caught by the chasing pack. His body racked with exhaustion and cramp, he slumped to the ground two miles from the finish. 
Despite this disappointment, Tarrant's endeavours in Liverpool had caught the eye. After he gave an impromptu press conference before boarding the train back to Buxton, a new nickname spread, courtesy of the Daily Express: the Ghost Runner. 
Over the coming years he would repeat the trick again and again, gatecrashing races across the country. As media attention and public interest grew, he would frequently need to slalom through a pack of stewards desperately trying to catch him at the start of races. When he won, which he began to do frequently, his success would be met either with eerie silence or a public scolding over the loudspeakers.
And yet, despite the official line, Tarrant had become a hugely popular character who would be cheered on by hundreds, sometimes thousands, of spectators.
""Tarrant was an unattractive human sledgehammer of a runner but with an indomitable spirit,"" says Bill Jones, author of The Ghost Runner - The Tragedy of the Man They Couldn't Catch.
""He ticked all the right boxes in the 1950s of the young, angry, working-class hero.""
In 1958 a letter finally arrived from the AAA informing Tarrant that his ban had been overturned. Although exact reasoning was not given, the decision came just one month after Harold Abrahams - 100m gold medallist at the 1924 Paris Olympics and influential member of various athletic committees - wrote an article highlighting crude deficiencies in the case against Tarrant.
But elation quickly gave way to renewed resentment. It emerged that while Tarrant had been cleared to run in British races, he would remain banned from representing his country internationally. 
His dream of running at the Olympics crushed, Tarrant nonetheless went on to dominate the domestic scene, establishing himself as one of the best long-distance runners in Britain. 
1960s saw him win a blizzard of events, including the London to Brighton 54-mile race twice, the Liverpool to Blackpool 48-mile race three times, and the Exeter to Plymouth 44-mile race five times. He set world records at 40 and 100 miles - to go with his Territorial Army 110-mile march record set in 1959.    
But just as in Liverpool, there were also numerous races where he failed to finish, often because of the stomach complaints that plagued his career. On any given day he could reign supreme or be seen staggering away, arms clutched around his abdomen.
By the mid-1960s, a sense of dissatisfaction was setting in. The desire for a new challenge, and to compete around the world, now consumed Tarrant. 
South Africa's Comrades Marathon, linking Durban and Pietermaritzburg, describes itself as the oldest ultra-marathon in the world, stretching for about 55 miles through KwaZulu-Natal province. 
In 1968 it was still an exclusively white male race. Black competitors, and women, were formally excluded. But a few still raced nonetheless. 
rrant was among the interlopers that year, after South African officials rejected his application to run following pressure from the AAA. For the first time in his life, the Ghost Runner joined other phantoms on the fringes. 
A fourth-place finish was more than respectable, but below par in the eyes of Tarrant. He returned the following year, this time while entertaining the idea of emigrating. 
His second Comrades looked like being a complete disaster but was salvaged by a gutsy display that saw him finish 28th after suffering debilitating stomach issues along the way - far beyond what had seemed possible at halfway. 
rrant took on the Comrades twice more, in 1970 and 1971, failing to finish both times. His dream of conquering the gruelling contest remained unfulfilled, but it did lead to arguably his defining moment.  
During the 1969 Comrades, whispers began circulating about a new, multi-ethnic race that would be open to all. As the date neared, it remained unclear whether it would go ahead and how many - if any - white runners would compete.  
On the morning of 6 September 1970, as runners gathered in Stanger for the Gold Top Marathon, a 50-mile race to Durban, there was a solitary white competitor: John Tarrant. He won it in five hours 43 minutes. 
following year the number of white runners doubled, with a 15-year-old Dave Upfold, who had begun training with Tarrant occasionally, also competing. 
""We were expecting the police, maybe even the army,"" says Upfold. 
""In 1971 we simply weren't allowed to compete together, but there was nothing. 
""It was the start of the acceptance that people of colour could run, and run well. 
""By 1975, the Comrades was fully integrated with women and all ethnicities taking part, and Tarrant was certainly part of that."" 
rrant also won that 1971 Gold Top, improving his time by three minutes, but serious problems were emerging.
Six weeks later he suffered a massive haemorrhage and woke up vomiting blood. Doctors failed to diagnose a cause so he was discharged from hospital and soon back running over 100 miles a week. All was clearly not well, but quite remarkably, one final epic remained.  
On 23 October 1971, 12 runners, including a 39-year-old Tarrant, began the Radox 100 Mile track race held at the Uxbridge Sports Centre in west London.
By mile 60 he was struggling badly, alternating between walking and slowly jogging, with race leader Ron Bentley 17 minutes ahead. The once imperious ghost was fading dramatically and few held much hope of him finishing, let alone winning. 
But as he had done time and time again, Tarrant dug deep into what propelled him and battled on. Slowly the gap began to shrink until he was just two laps behind Bentley. Suddenly the unthinkable seemed possible.  
In the end, thanks to a late burst, Bentley finished 14 minutes ahead of second-placed Tarrant, who ended his last major race in an appalling condition - his lips blue, froth seeping from his mouth as he collapsed at the finish line. Eventually his brother Vic, his steadfast rock throughout the years, shepherded him into a waiting car and the Ghost Runner disappeared. Forever. 
""It was Tarrant's greatest race,"" said race organiser Eddie Gutteridge in Jones' book, The Ghost Runner. 
""He was in bits, mortally ill as we now know. God knows how he did it. It moved you to be there.""
wo years later Tarrant was finally diagnosed with stomach cancer. He died on 18 January 1975, aged just 42.
, in his adopted home of Hereford, close to the city's running club, stands a sculpture in his honour - created, somewhat symbolically, by vulnerable teenagers living in a residential home nearby. 
""He believed in fairness. Fairness for himself, fairness for everybody, equality for all,"" says Upfold. ""Nearly 50 years after his death, people still remember the name John Tarrant.""      
r adds: ""He wasn't allowed to officially win, but he was still determined to show people what he could do.
""It wasn't just about running. It was about overcoming adversity and believing in yourself. That's why people still love this story.""  "	/sport/62607571

sports	Frankie Dettori: Jockey says he will ride for one final season before retiring	"Jockey Frankie Dettori has announced that 2023 will be his final season.
52-year-old, one of the sport's best-known figures, has ridden more than 3,300 British winners since his first back in 1987.
His wins also include 21 British Classic successes and three champion jockey titles.
""Next year, 2023, will be my final professional year as a jockey. It's something I've been thinking about for a while,"" he told ITV Racing.
""My heart wants to carry on riding but I have to use my brain. I want to stop at the top. It has been difficult, but I think it's the right time.""
Italian-born jockey plans to start his final season at Santa Anita on 26 December, and his final rides could be at the same Californian track during the 2023 Breeders' Cup next November.
He is still widely remembered for his Magnificent Seven achievement at Ascot in September 1996, where he went through the card, taking all seven races at odds of 25,051-1.
In June 2000, he and fellow jockey Ray Cochrane survived a plane crash at Newmarket which killed the pilot Patrick Mackey. Cochrane pulled Dettori from the burning wreckage.
Another challenging period was a six-month ban in late 2012 for failing a drug test, which he later admitted was a positive test for cocaine.
Since 2015 he has worked as first jockey to John Gosden, who now trains alongside his son Thady. But last June there was a well-publicised split between jockey and trainer described as a ""sabbatical"", although Dettori was soon back riding for the Gosdens.
Dettori's decision to call it a day is not one he has taken lightly.
""It is a very difficult decision because my heart wants to carry on riding, but I have had to use my brain and I've just turned 52 and next year I'll be 53,"" he said.
""I want to be competitive enough to do my owners and my horses justice next year, and I think I'm still in that bracket of being good. It was difficult, but it is the right time.
""I spoke to my dad at length. My dad stopped at 51, he is very supporting and I also had to speak to my wife and children who are delighted because they have barely seen me for 35 years.
""I've been thinking about it for a few weeks and I've decided with the firepower I have next year and the horses I have to ride I can finish my career on a big note. Fingers crossed I stay in one piece and we'll give it a good go next year.
""Look at Ronaldo, one day he was playing and he's on the bench the next. I don't want to end up like that and end up where I'm struggling to get rides in the big races. At the moment I still have good horses to ride and I want to finish like that.""
AP McCoy, the 20-time champion jump jockey who retired in 2015, was among those who paid tribute to Dettori.
""The hardest thing is knowing when to stop,"" said McCoy. ""It's about beating the clock - and Frankie is going out at the top.
""He's racing's Lionel Messi - you can't teach a kid to ride like Frankie Dettori.""
Frank Keogh, BBC Sport
Frankie Dettori will leave a huge void in horse racing as one of the sport's most recognised, talented and charismatic individuals.
He created headlines around the world with his Magnificent Seven at Ascot, one highlight in a career for which the word 'rollercoaster' is a perfect fit.
uccess led to television appearances as a presenter on Top of the Pops and captain on A Question of Sport. He even launched his own pizza range.
In 2000, he was lucky to escape with his life in a plane crash at Newmarket.
Dettori enjoyed widespread success as number one jockey for Sheikh Mohammed's powerful Godolphin stable before a split and six-month ban after testing positive for cocaine left his career at a crossroads in 2013.
His reunion with old mentor John Gosden brought renewed success, including a second Derby win at Epsom for the jockey with Golden Horn and numerous big-race successes with the likes of Enable and Stradivarius.
Dettori, who celebrated his 52nd birthday on Thursday, will now effectively go on a year-long farewell tour taking in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and the UK.
And then there will be one final flying dismount for racing's greatest showman."	/sport/horse-racing/64011657

sports	Commonwealth Games: Inside NI's historic performance at Birmingham 2022	"The clues that it was going to be a record-breaking Commonwealth Games for Northern Ireland came early.
uty and the curse of the multi-sport event is that you have different sports happening in different venues at the same time.
A glorious melting pot of sport and its unrivalled ability to bring people and cultures together? Yes.
A logistical impossibility for a reporter tasked with covering one nation's exploits? Also yes.
On day one, this reporter was just getting himself in position at Arena Birmingham to watch Rhys McClenaghan, Ewan McAteer and Eamon Montgomery go in the artistic gymnastics when Daniel Wiffen set a new national record and qualified fastest for the 400m freestyle final at Sandwell Aquatics Centre.
Come on now, Daniel, read the itinerary. You weren't meant to be the story until the evening.
At this point I should extend my thanks to the gymnasts, who ensured the morning's narrative would not centre solely around the swimming pool by making it the first time that Northern Ireland would have three gymnasts in apparatus finals.
ry first morning and an important lesson learned: it's going to be unpredictable, better to just lean into it. 
And so it went from there, the records never stopped tumbling.
When the Games schedule was released, Barry McClements and Wiffen couldn't help but notice that their first medal opportunities both came on the very first night.
Cue generic team-mate ribbing in the build-up to that Friday. Who was going to win NI's first Commonwealth swimming medal in the pool?
In the end it was McClements, whose bronze in the S9 100m backstroke prompted scenes of euphoria from the small pocket of his team-mates in the stands, who watched the last 25m or so between their fingers.
It hadn't been a bad night for Wiffen, who missed out on a medal by 0.13 seconds but broke the national record he had set the very same morning.
Call it hindsight, but after the first night there was a palpable feeling that everything was on the table. If day one was anything to go by, NI were primed to go beyond whatever had gone before.
r cause was aided by the Commonwealth Games' biggest-ever Para-sport programme, from which the team's first two medals were delivered courtesy of McClements and Para-triathlete Chloe MacCombe before judokas Yasmin Javadian and Nathon Burns struck bronze at Coventry Arena.
rd Para-sport medal came during a momentous evening in Team NI's Games history.
In many ways Bethany Firth's S14 200m freestyle gold was the least remarkable moment of that Wednesday simply because her dominance of that event, and standing as one of Para-swimming's biggest stars, was established long before she arrived in Birmingham.
On that same evening, Wiffen and heptathlete Kate O'Connor announced themselves on the global stage with silver medals in two arenas that Northern Ireland have rarely, if ever, had an impact.
O'Connor's heptathlon silver, behind one of the biggest names in UK athletics in Katarina Johnson-Thompson, was the type of performance that forces the rest of the track community to sit up and take notice.
Similarly Wiffen took second in the 1500m freestyle with a time that would have put him sixth in last year's Olympic final.
What's most exciting about O'Connor and Wiffen is that both are 21, and with their best years in front of them have in the last 11 days taken a huge stride towards joining the absolute elite competitors in their chosen field.
, perhaps, will in time come to be what NI's performance at Birmingham 2022 is most notably remembered for.
All the while the snowball kept picking up pace. McClenaghan found himself in that peculiar position of being initially disappointed by a major silver medal, but in the context of a disappointing 2021 the Ards man concluded it was evidence enough that he is on the right track.
Meanwhile over in the quaint surroundings of Royal Leamington Spa's Victoria Park, Northern Ireland's perfect blend of youth and experience were running amok through the competition in the lawn bowls men's fours.
Martin McHugh and Ian McClure partied like it was 1998 as they recaptured the title 24 years on from Kuala Lumpur, this time alongside Sam Barkley and Adam McKeown. Then just a couple of hours later Gary Kelly took silver in the men's singles.
It set things up nicely for the final day, where six NI boxers had advanced to finals after Eireann Nugent had taken bronze.
Carly McNaul, she of two surgeries and a broken femur since 2018, returned to the ring and claimed silver. The 33-year-old has already set her sights on the Paris Olympics.
me the fantastic five. On Sunday at the National Exhibition Centre, Northern Ireland's five gold medallists catapulted their team up the medal table on a day that will go down as surely Team NI's greatest.
As the madness unfolded at the NEC, Ciara Mageean used all her experience to break clear of her competitors alongside Laura Muir and take a silver which, like her athletics team-mate O'Connor's achievement, was a display worthy of global appreciation in an immensely competitive race.
Of course for those trying to cover the Games, the only maddening thing was that the athletics and the boxing took place some 10 miles away from each other.
But by this stage, it had long been established that one could not cover every event. The only thing to do was try to take as much of it in as possible and acknowledge the magnitude of what Team NI accomplished.
re is only so many times you can reiterate how impressive their medal haul is.
Although I suppose it's fitting that in these most historic of Games, it's rather easy to sound like a broken record."	/sport/commonwealth-games/62467474

ude a commitment to install Pride Houses within the athletes' villages at every future Games, sensitivity training for staff, and resources for asylum-seeking charities where LGBT+ people can seek safety.
""There are other sporting events that aren't taking a stand in any way,"" Daley told BBC Sport. 
""There are so many examples of major events being held in places where it is illegal to be gay. For instance, the Fifa World Cup being held in Qatar, Formula 1 in Saudi Arabia.
""The silence speaks a thousand words.""
In the lead-up to the Qatar World Cup this winter, 16 LGBTIQ+ organisations - representing lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, queer or questioning fans - have been engaging with Fifa, presenting action points on rights they want to see implemented before the tournament. They said in March that ""progress has been slow"". Tournament organisers have said ""everyone will be welcome"".
Within Formula 1, where races have been held in both Qatar and Saudi Arabia, individual drivers such as Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel have worn Pride colours during races.
It is illegal to be gay in more than half the 54 countries that competed at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Many of these include countries where laws were exported by the UK during colonial rule.
During the opening ceremony in Birmingham, four-time champion Daley joined athletes and advocates from different countries within the Commonwealth carrying 'Progress Pride' flags into Alexander Stadium.
""In the UK, I think the Pride flag can be taken for granted,"" Daley told BBC Sport. ""For lots of people around the Commonwealth, it's a sign of safety and acceptance.""
One of the flag-bearers was Jason Jones - an LGBT+ activist from Trinidad who, in 2018, won a legal challenge at the High Court of Trinidad and Tobago which decriminalised adult same-sex intimacy.
He said what happened at the opening ceremony was ""a small step for LGBT+ people, but a giant leap in the sports world for LGBT+ people"".
Daley added: ""This was the first time any sporting event had anything so bold.""
In order to draw up his plan, Daley spent much of the last year travelling to - or speaking to people from - a number of countries where laws are hostile to LGBT+ people, including Jamaica, Pakistan and Nigeria.
All of this is documented in a one-off film, which will be shown on BBC One on Tuesday, 9 August, at 21:00 BST.
Daley hears horrific stories of people being beaten, stoned and killed for their sexuality. 
His initial stance was any country in which it is illegal to be gay should be banned from hosting the Games, but he has since modified that.
""There shouldn't be further oppression of telling people what they should and shouldn't do, but instead allowing the sporting federation to draw up a set of values,"" he said. 
""That way, it's on individual countries to embrace those values if they do want to host the Games."""	/sport/commonwealth-games/62479810
sports	A 'cultural problem' that 'impacts mentally' - GAA referees discuss abuse as campaign launched	"There is a cultural problem of abuse of referees within the GAA and it can have an impact on their mental health, two high-profile referees have said.
revealed referees are getting abused during every match and that a lot of the abuse comes from children.
David Coldrick and Sean Hurson were speaking as the GAA launched a new initiative calling for more respect for match officials.
""Over the years it becomes more mental,"" Coldrick said of the impact.
""You go out as a volunteer for the association to do the best job that you possibly can. You are never going to get everything right, you try your best and you referee in front of you on the day but it can be tough in the immediate aftermath. 
""Like players and lots of people involved in the association, we have day jobs and the initial day or two after those tough matches can be difficult, so it does impact mentally.""
'Give Respect, Get Respect' campaign, the launch of which comes after a number of high-profile incidents recently where referees have suffered extreme forms of both verbal and physical abuse, will see a Respect the Referee Day held across the weekend of 22 and 23 October.
Research conducted with 438 referees by Dr. Noel Brick of Ulster University during the 2021 lockdown GAA season revealed that 94% had suffered verbal abuse while 23% had suffered physical abuse.
Coldrick, who has officiated in four All-Ireland senior football finals, said he has not been physically abused but that there was an incident 15 years ago that did make him consider his future as a ref.
""The closest I came must have been 15 years ago at a club senior semi-final in Meath when someone attempted to throw a pint of Guinness over me,"" he explained.
""In my career that was the most difficult time to get across in terms of 'is this for me and do I want to keep this going?' I had a lot of good people around me that got me through that.""  
Hurson, meanwhile, gave an insight into what he feels is a cultural problem within the GAA that has led to children feeling it is OK to abuse referees.
And the man who officiated in this year's All-Ireland senior football final also delivered a warning of the impact it could have on the future of refereeing in the sport.
""If you were to speak to any of the referees who are doing these [youth] tournaments, they can't believe the level of abuse they receive from young children, their parents and coaches,"" he said.
""If that continues, there will be a problem of recruitment and we will not get new guys to referee. It starts at youth age where it [abusing refs] is deemed acceptable and that shouldn't be the case. 
""When we go to a lot of club matches or county games we see people who go there to spectate and they will question every decision the referee will make.
""They lose the run of themselves, regardless of who is sitting beside them, whether it is their children. So the children are seeing their parents or grandparents, they are seeing the abuse that their parents are giving towards referees. 
""The children are seeing this and it is a poor example. The problem is escalating as a result of the culture that is there within our association at the moment."" 
Like Coldrick, Hurson has never been physically abused but he did explain the impact the verbal abuse he receives can have on his family.
""Thankfully I haven't been [physically] assaulted in any way but I do get abused every day I go out from someone, whether it is in the stand or on the field or coming off the field. 
""I would have to say players in general are very respectful and we generally have no issue with the players on the field. It is the spectators and the mentors, especially at youth football.
""We are volunteers, we have families. I have three young children at home and a wife that is watching the game, and sometimes it can be difficult. 
""My parents are watching the game and you always be very conscious that some people are throwing abuse. It affects them and it is very hurtful."" "	/sport/gaelic-games/63223707

favourite, 25, triumphed with a new Games record of 206kg from her snatch and clean and jerk lifts on Sunday.
""They are always proud of me, but I think my parents will be prouder than before,"" Lawal told BBC Sport.
""This Commonwealth gold means a lot to me, and I'm really excited about it because I didn't expect it, but God did it for me.""
Lawal has already conquered the continent by picking 59kg gold at the 2019 African Games and the 2021 African Weightlifting Championships.
A gold medallist at the 2021 Commonwealth Championship in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, she admitted her Commonwealth record was unexpected on the way to winning Nigeria's third gold in Birmingham.
""I'm really happy because I didn't even know I broke the record. I was only focussed on winning the gold medal,"" she added.
""Hearing the fans [Nigerians in the crowd] really helped. Although it's not the first time I will be facing a huge crowd, but the support really calmed my nerves.""
Lawal's success in Birmingham is a positive for Africa's most populous nation, but Nigeria's powerlifting successes at the Commonwealth Games has often been blighted by doping violations.
Nigerian Weightlifting Federation was suspended for repeated doping violations by the International Weightlifting Federation in 2001 and banned from competing in the following year's Manchester Games.
Back in 2014, 16-year-old weightlifter Chika Amalaha was stripped of her gold medal after failing a drugs test.

sports	Olympic medals: An alternative table - with US 15th	"Olympics medals table was again dominated by the biggest countries like the US, which finished top.  But how would the table look if population and wealth were taken into account? 
When it comes to counting the medal spoils, there is a strong sense of deja vu. Every four years, the same few countries rack up medal after medal - the US, China, Russia - and Tokyo 2020 was no different.
US won 113 medals total, including 39 golds, the most of any country. 
So what makes countries like the US dominate, while others lag behind? Economists and data nerds have a few theories.
""It's still loud and clear from the patterns that what matters is population, level of income, and political system,"" says David Forrest, an economist at the University of Liverpool who researches Olympic predictions.
Population matters, Mr Forrest says, because the bigger the pool of athletes, the more likely it is for a country to produce true competitors.
""It's clear that very few people who are born have got the potential to be a world-class athlete,"" he says.
ke a country like Luxembourg, which has a population of 633,622. It sent 12 athletes to compete in seven sports, and won no medals. Meanwhile the US, which has the third-largest population in the world, sent 613 athletes to compete in 35 sports and took home more medals than any other country.
Some countries over-perform, given their population size. The BBC came up with an alternative ranking, which looked at the number of medals won per million people. In this scenario, the tiny European nation of San Marino, with a population of just over 33,000, comes out on top, even though it earned only three medals. The US didn't even crack the top 20, coming in at 60th place.
But population, by itself, is not enough to guarantee a country sweeps the podium.
""If a country is very poor, it won't have the resources to convert that potential into actual ability to compete on a world stage,"" says Mr Forrest.
""They've got to have the ability to participate in sport in the first place. For example, they might have a great natural ability in swimming that is waiting to be developed - but actually there won't be any swimming pools.""
When poorer countries do win, they tend to win at sports that are lower-cost, like wrestling, he says, while wealthy countries outperform in expensive sports like equestrian and sailing.
When taking into account the average national wealth per person, China and Russia (numbers two and three in total medals) actually did better than the US. Under these alternative rankings, China comes in first, and Russia second, with Kenya coming in third place.
US, normally top dog, lagged behind at number 15. 
re are cultural and political factors too. Mr Forrest says that countries that used to belong to the Soviet Union tend to have an advantage, because of the strong sports infrastructure that was established by communist regimes.
Commonwealth countries also tend to do better than expected compared to their size and wealth. Mr Forrest believes that's because Britain was a pioneer in developing sport as we know it today, and brought that enthusiasm for athletic competition with them around the world.
Australia, which often cracks the top-10 for total medal count, is a prime example.
rts a country chooses to compete in matter too.
In India, cricket is the de facto national sport but is not played at the Olympics. India also does tend to excel at hockey, which is played at the Olympics, but that only yields a maximum of two medals, one for men and one for women. Whereas sports competed by an individual, such as gymnastics, swimming and athletics, can yield several per athlete.
""In general, it doesn't do you a lot of good to be keen on team sports,"" Mr Forrest says.
But using variables like population and GDP are not true indicators of performance either, says Simon Gleave, head of sport analysis at data company Nielsen Gracenote, because they don't show which countries are doing better or worse than before.
""What you won't pick up is countries that are improving fast or declining fast, and I think that's the interesting part in all of this,"" he tells the BBC.
Past performance, he says, is a much better predictor of who will do well - and it allows you to set expectations against achievement. 
r gauge the Olympic winners, Gracenote takes into account how each country has done at other international sporting competitions since the last Olympic games.
king that into account, they predicted that India would actually have its best year yet, which it did, finishing 33rd in terms of most medals won. That smashed its previous record of 51st, from 2008."	/news/world-us-canada-58143550

Dayaan Cassiem saw his opener cancelled out by Shane O'Donoghue but the South African captain restored their lead.
Kok added a third but Ireland hit back through O'Donogue and John McKee.
However, the host nation had the final say when Mustaphaa Cassiem slotted home a penalty in the final quarter.
""Just gutted, to be honest, really gutted. Credit to South Africa, they were good today and they took their chances,"" said Ireland captain Sean Murray. 
""We put a lot of pressure on, had some good chances as well but in the end, it just comes down to little details and it's just bitterly disappointing.""
Ireland defeated South Africa 1-0 in the group stages of the inaugural Nations Cup and had just shy of double the amount of shots of their opponents in the final, but Mark Tumilty's men fell short. 
Captain Cassiem, who was awarded player of the match and tournament, opened the scoring in the fourth minute but O'Donoghue responded in the 19th minute.
Cassiem fired home his second just before half-time to give South Africa the advantage, and Kok swiftly added a third after the restart to extend their lead.
O'Donoghue hit back with a penalty corner to give Ireland hope, and they levelled in the third quarter when McKee fired into the circle and a touch off a South African defender took the ball past Estiaan Kriek.

sports	David Smith looking to defend world boccia title	"Britain's most successful boccia player is looking to defend his title at the 2022 World Boccia Championships.
David Smith OBE has been selected as part of the nine-strong Great Britain squad that competes from Saturday, 3 December in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.
33-year old has been competing since the 2003 British Championships.
""My aim is to try and defend my title... I'm feeling pretty dominant this year so I'm looking to try and keep that momentum going,"" he said.
Smith OBE, who is based in Swansea, started competing at boccia 19 years ago and has since gone on to become Paralympic Champion, World Champion and European Champion.
Boccia is a target sport played indoors with soft leather balls and has no Olympic equivalent.
Upon his GB selection Smith said: ""I've been doing it for so long I kind of expect to be selected, but you've got to earn your place, I think I've done enough to get selected.
""The only way is down so for me it is just a case of trying to maintain that number one.""
Smith competes in boccia's BC1 category, one of four classifications determined by the severity of the athletes' disability. 
BC1 athletes have severe activity limitations affecting their legs, arms and trunk, and are typically dependent on a powered wheelchair.
Although Smith has had an incredibly successful career so far, leaving a legacy within the sport is also important to him.
""I enjoy playing, I enjoy winning, I enjoy competing, but the end result is not so important for me anymore, it's more about when I do eventually decide to retire, are there people who are able to replace me?
""What would be a shame is that if I was to retire and then the sport falls off a cliff.""
rt's funding relies on athletes winning medals at competitions, so it is Smith's goal to get more people involved in it.
""My aim now is community sport, getting boccia played in every primary school in the UK and then building that. Ideally I want boccia to be played by everybody not just people with disabilities,"" he told BBC Sport Wales.
When asked what improvements he would like to see within the sport Smith replied: ""Development of new players, more tournaments and a league structure... focusing on the whole sport coming up through the ranks."""	/sport/disability-sport/63826462

51-year-old has failed to qualify for the season-ending World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace.
""I played not too differently from last season, the throwing averages are similar,"" he told BBC Radio Solent.
""I was top 50 with the good guys but my average dropped from 93 to 92 this year - it's not much but I'm disappointed.""
Mitchell, from Christchurch in Dorset, made his PDC World Darts Championship debut last year after gaining his two-year tour card in January 2021.
If he wants to claim it back he will have to go through qualifying school in the new year.
""I would like to go back and get it [card] again because even the top players didn't crack the tour after two years,"" he added.
""Some of them have been there four or five years before they became regulars on the TV. I feel the first two years I've had have been a nice honeymoon, but I would like to give it another go.""
Mitchell, nicknamed Scotty Dog, had a breakthrough year in 2014 where he won a number of events organised by the now-defunct British Darts Association (BDO).
He won the BDO World Darts Championship in 2015 and ended the year ranked world number one, but he has been unable to hit the same form since joining the PDC Tour.
One of the biggest challenges he faces is juggling his job as a farmer with throwing and competing.
""It's difficult to compete with full time pro's when you're still working. It's not a five day a week job, we're farming 24/7.
""This [darts] is a glorified hobby for me. But maybe it's time I applied myself a little bit more, I don't know, but I have enjoyed every second of the tour and it's been a great two years of my life.""
Mitchell says it would be impossible to even consider a future as a darts player without his supportive family by his side: ""We do everything together and we're very much about having family discussions about the important things, and darts is one of them.
""I have options but I have to weigh up what's best for me and what's best for the farm. I'm not really that good at saying what's best but my family know me very well, and they know what suits me.
""Now that the BDO has gone the amateur side, away from the PDC, has come alive and there are varying organisations and tournaments I can play in.
""I do some commentary as well and there is also the World Seniors Tour, which I qualify for now.
""I still play for Dorset and my daughter plays in the women's team too and I absolutely love it. That's one thing that won't change, until they tell me that they don't want me anymore - we just have to sit down and discuss where my future plans lie."""	/sport/darts/63796072

Sale ran in five tries to record a bonus point and notch a sixth home win out of seven in the Premiership.
m O'Flaherty, Simon McIntyre, Ewan Ashman, Rob du Preez all crossed, along with a penalty try as they did the double over Leicester.  
It was a first loss for the Tigers under interim head coach Richard Wigglesworth, with just a Handre Pollard try to show for a difficult evening.
Since Sale beat Leicester to become champions in 2006, they have only reached the play-offs once.
But they have made big strides since Alex Sanderson took up the director of rugby role in January 2021 as he tries to turn them into a Premiership force once again. 
ry leaves them well placed for a top-two finish and a possible home semi-final for the chance to reach Twickenham for the first time in 17 years.
As for Leicester, they are now 10 points behind Sale and will have to do it the hard way if they are to defend their crown. 
was a difficult night as they suffered their heaviest defeat of the season and suffered a catalogue of injuries. Things were so bad that replacement hooker Gabriel Oghre finished the game at centre.
r former head coach and new England boss Steve Borthwick was in the stands, along with Kevin Sinfield, in a crowd of 9,491, the highest at the AJ Bell Stadium this season, as Sale showed why they have the meanest defence in the Premiership as they repelled early Tigers pressure deep within their own half.
Leicester were awarded a number of penalties, but despite being able to call on the boot of South Africa World Cup winner Pollard, who kicked 20 points as the Springboks defeated England in the 2019 World Cup final in Yokohama, they opted to kick to the corner in search of a try but ultimately to no avail.  
And when Sale got into opposing territory, they had little hesitation in asking Rob du Preez to kick a hat-trick of penalties to get the scoreboard moving.
xtended that lead further thanks to a slick handling move across the backs featuring full-back Luke James and Arron Reed ended with Reed's opposite wing O'Flaherty touching down.
Reed thought he had put the game out of Leicester's reach at the end of the half but after a long deliberation by the TMO, it was deemed that he had knocked on rather than added a second try.
me side looked the more threatening at the start of the second half, but a loose pass by Du Preez allowed Pollard to run in an interception for his first Premiership try on his first start. 
Yet there was a gasp of disbelief when the fly-half sliced his conversion way off target from his only effort from the tee.
Any hopes of a comeback were short-lived as a typical Manu Tuilagi burst opened a hole in the visitors' defence and the resulting pressure saw prop McIntyre claim the try.          
A penalty try saw the advantage grow further and with Leicester replacement Sean Jansen shown a yellow card, the bonus point was inevitable.
Replacement hooker Ewan Ashman delivered it and there was still time for Du Preez to run in a fifth try.
Former England scrum half Joe Simpson, on his final appearance before retirement, failed to add the champagne moment by missing the conversion, but it did not dampen the mood of excitement building among Sharks supporters. 
Sale Sharks defence coach Mike Forshaw:
""We thought it would be an arm wrestle, we didn't expect to put 40 points on them. But if you nail your set-pieces and your defence, you win games.
""You have to look at who's sat in the stand [for us], George Ford, a world class 10, Raffi Quirke, an England scrum half, Bevan Rodd. It's a juicy prospect to have that artillery coming back with what we already have.
""We need more nights like this, as playing in front of a crowd like this is a massive advantage to us.""  
Leicester Tigers interim head coach Richard Wigglesworth:
""We started quite well, we were aggressive and went for points but we didn't score. 
""If you don't take your chances at maul when you're close to the line, it feels like you're going to be on the back foot all game.
""Before we knew it, we were 16-0 down at half time and it was always going to be a long way back from there.

sports	Tokyo Olympics: German pentathlon coach thrown out for punching horse	"A German coach has been thrown out of the Olympics for appearing to punch a horse who was refusing to jump or trot during the modern pentathlon.
Coach Kim Raisner was heard on German TV urging tearful athlete Annika Schleu to ""really hit"" the horse while she struggled to control Saint Boy during the showjumping round of Friday's women's event.
Schleu had been leading the event before the equestrian, where athletes are given just 20 minutes to bond with a horse they have never ridden.
Modern pentathlon's governing body, the UIPM, said it had reviewed video footage that appeared to show Raisner - who competed at the 2004 Olympics in modern pentathlon - striking the horse with her fist.
""Her actions were deemed to be in violation of the UIPM competition rules, which are applied to all recognised modern pentathlon competitions including the Olympic Games,"" the governing body said in a statement.
""The UIPM Executive Board [EB] has given a black card to the Germany team coach Kim Raisner, disqualifying her from the remainder of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.
""The EB decision was made today at the Tokyo Stadium before the resumption of the men's modern pentathlon competition.""
Saint Boy is not among the horses due to be ridden during Saturday's men's modern pentathlon competition.

Goals from Ben Lake, Mark Garside and David Gilbert helped the Giants to victory in front of a sellout crowd.
Zack Phillips was on target for Fife, who had lost 8-0 to Belfast when the sides last met on 22 December.
Giants continue their recent busy schedule when they play the Flyers in Kirkcaldy on New Year's Eve.
In a poignant moment pre-game there was a minute's applause as the Giants paid tribute to fans and members of the organisation who had passed away during 2022 as their images were displayed on the big screens in the arena. 
For the majority of the opening period it was a case of netminders on top as Peyton Jones and Fife's Shane Owen pulled off a series of saves as both teams battled to get on the scoreboard. 
me side eventually broke the deadlock as Lake's shot crept under Fife netminder Owen just after halfway through the first period. 
In a penalty-free opening 20 minutes of play the Giants gave a debut to new signing Donovan Neuls, who nearly scored on his first shift on home ice.
g team flew out of the blocks at the start of the second period, equalizing through Phillips after Jones had saved the initial two efforts by the Flyers.

sports	Diana Kipyokei loses Boston title after six-year doping ban	"Kenyan marathoners Diana Kipyokei and Purity Rionoripo have been banned from athletics for doping, meaning there are now at least 60 athletes from the country currently serving suspensions issued by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU). 
Kipyokei, whose 2021 Boston Marathon title has now been annulled, and Rionoripo, winner of the Paris Marathon in 2017, have been banned for six and five years respectively. 
for Kipyokei, 28, has been backdated to June 2022, when the AIU provisionally suspended her, while her results have been disqualified since the day she provided a urine test following her Boston win in October 2021. 
""That sample returned an adverse analytical finding (AAF) for the presence of a metabolite of triamcinolone acetonide, an anti-inflammatory,"" the AIU said in a statement. 
""With investigative assistance from the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya, the AIU discovered that Kipyokei provided false/misleading information in trying to explain her AAF, including fake documentation which she alleged came from a hospital."" 
Rionoripo's ban came after the presence of the diuretic furosemide in an out-of-competition test in Kenya conducted in May. 
Like Kipyokei, the 29-year-old was also found to have attempted to have tampered with the evidence against her. 
""In her explanation, she claimed to have been prescribed medication by a doctor at a hospital to treat an ankle injury and presented supporting documentation,"" the AIU continued. 
""Investigations revealed that though Rionoripo was treated at the hospital, she had altered her prescription form."" 
Since she has admitted her guilt, the six-year ban sought by the AIU for Rionoripo was reduced by twelve months, and has been backdated to start from 21 November. 
Elsewhere, another Kenyan - Betty Wilson Lempus - has been charged with a further violation, on top of the provisional suspension announced in October after also being accused of tampering. 
Like both Kipyokei, she was found to have triamcinolone acetonide in her system, which the AIU confirmed after dismissing the explanation given for her positive test. 
In response to the attempts to explain away failed drug tests through concocted stories, the head of the AIU has pledged to keep tackling these practices. 
""[We will use] the full extent of our intelligence and investigative capabilities to uncover the truth and keep the sport of athletics clean,"" said Brett Clothier. 
Clothier also addressed the recent pledge by the Kenyan government to commit $5m annually, which is believed to have helped avert a sanction by governing body World Athletics. 
""It is a crucial first step and has the potential to be a game changer because it will ensure [the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya] and Athletics Kenya have proportionate resources to play their part in the fight against doping."" "	/sport/africa/64043612
sports	Russia's Natalya Antyukh stripped of London 2012 gold	"Russia's Natalya Antyukh has been stripped of 400m hurdles gold from London 2012 on the basis of historical data from a Moscow testing laboratory.
Antyukh, now 41, is already serving a four-year ban after being named in a World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) investigation into cheating by Russia.
American Lashinda Demus will be promoted to gold in her place.
All three gold medals won on the track by Russian athletes at London 2012 have now been rescinded on doping grounds.
Mariya Savinova and Yuliya Zaripova, the initial winners of 800m and 3000m steeplechase gold, have been disqualified.
Ivan Ukhov's high jump title and Tatyana Lysenko's hammer victory in the field have also been wiped from the record books.
McLaren Report, commissioned by Wada and published in 2016, claimed that more than 1,000 Russian athletes across various sports had been involved in a state-sponsored programme of systematic doping.
It added that London 2012 was ""corrupted on an unprecedented scale"".
Brett Clothier, the head of the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), which disqualified Antyukh, said it was committed to ""clean and fair competition and results, even if a decade later"".
""The AIU remains committed to investigating all cases of potential violations and securing the appropriate outcomes,"" added Clothier. 
""The integrity of the sport of athletics is our utmost priority and we are pleased, in this instance, that athletes who competed fairly at the highest level will ultimately be acknowledged as the rightful medal winners.""
Antyukh has struck a defiant tone on social media. Her last Instagram post on 18 August is a photo of her showing off her silver and bronze medals from the 2004 Olympics. Those medals remain unaffected by the latest AIU decision.

sports	Commonwealth Games: Scotland claim four golds in less than four hours	"Scotland claimed an astonishing four gold medals - and six in total - during less than four hours of incredible Commonwealth Games drama in Birmingham on Wednesday.
Para-bowlers Pauline Wilson and Rosemary Lenton started the rush, the latter becoming Scotland's oldest gold medallist at the age of 72.
, Sarah Adlington retained her +78kg judo title and became Scotland's first ever double judo gold medallist, before swimmer Duncan Scott added his second gold with a Games record in the 200m individual medley. 
And Eilish McColgan produced the most remarkable result of all to rampage to victory in the 10,000m and match her mother Liz's success in 1986 and 1990. And just for good measure, she did it in a Games record with her maw watching trackside.
ruscating few hours were bookended by Adlington's team-mate Rachel Tytler taking bronze in the -78kg category, and Scott joining Craig McNally, Ross Murdoch - in the last races of their career - and Evan Jones to claim third in the 4 x 100m medley relay.
It added an enormous dollop of polish to Scotland's standing. Medals have been surprisingly bountiful, but golds vexingly rare. Not any more. The nine won in Goal Coast four years ago are now in significant danger of being surpassed.
Birmingham tally now stands at 32, with seven gold, eight silver and 17 bronze after six of the 11 days. Just 12 more of any colour matches the amount of four years ago. 
Boxer Reese Lynch, Sam Hickey and Sean Lazzerini all won their quarter-finals earlier on Wednesday to secure at least another three bronzes, and will watch team-mates Lennon Mulligan, Matthew McHale and Tyler Jolly try to do the same on Thursday.
riumph of Lenton and Wilson, with their combined age of 130, was a gently enjoyable start to an enthralling day.
uo didn't just beat their Australian opponents, they overwhelmed them 17-5 in a dominant display, having seen off England in their semi-final. It matched the achievement of their male pairs counterparts.
""I'd never thought we'd be going home with a gold medal,"" Lenton told BBC Scotland. ""I hoped and prayed we would. When it really mattered - the semi-finals and finals - we really turned it on, both of us.
""In a couple of weeks' time, I will be 73, but records are there to be broken and somebody will break that.""
Scott is your man for that kind of business. The swimmer has not only ransacked 78-year-old Alister Allan's record of 10 Commonwealth Games medals this week and pushed the mark out to 13, but he has also now stripped the shooter of the consolation that he had won more golds.
Olympic medallist now taken gold in the 200m freestyle and medley, as well as bronze in the 400m medley, 100m free, 4 x 200m freestyle and 4 x 100m medley relay, all in the past five days. And he took one of those off to rest.
""I'm absolutely exhausted,"" the 25-year-old told BBC Sport Scotland. ""I was really hurting and I'm really glad that I'm finished, to be honest. 
""It's been a really long week and I just scraped the barrel there and the team helped me out. I'm just absolutely buzzing for the four of us, and the four that did the heat. It's been all of us coming together to get that bronze.""
Given her recent difficulties with illness and injury - and the stacked nature of the 10,000m - it seemed a bronze might be the best McColgan could hope for. But the 31-year-old Dundonian is one of the most obdurate athletes on the circuit.
She led early and maintained her form throughout, before finding herself in a duel with Irine Cheptai with a lap to go. 
Kenyan surged ahead on the back straight but McColgan wasn't having any of her capers, digging in and rampaging past to record the biggest win of her career.
""I have never sprinted like that in my life and without the crowd I could never have done that,"" she told BBC Sport. ""It was vibrating through my body. 
""I couldn't have asked for anything more to have my family here. Your family know the ups and downs and this is my fourth attempt over four events and I have come sixth every time. You could see I wanted gold. To win it tonight was so special.""
Mother Liz, a redoubtably presence at the best of times, stood emotionally beside her as she spoke.
""To witness your daughter win in the same event is incredible,"" she added. ""She just ran the race I knew she was capable of running. I know how hard she works and it's fantastic it came together and she won."""	/sport/commonwealth-games/62400268

sports	Roger Federer & Serena Williams retirements leave a void for adoring fans	"Undivided devotion is usually associated with team sports. Travelling hundreds of miles to watch your heroes, supporting them through thick and thin. Naming a kid after a favourite player. Getting a tattoo. 
Such shows of allegiance and love have not traditionally been associated with tennis players.
Yet Roger Federer and Serena Williams - two superstars who retired this month - have attracted affection like few others.
And it felt fitting that two people born 49 days apart, who enjoyed era-defining parallel careers, called it a day within weeks of each other.
""These two players are irreplaceable. I don't think there is any question about that,"" said John McEnroe, another legendary tennis figure.
Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam singles champion who turned 41 this week, waved farewell amid emotional scenes at the US Open.
ree weeks later, 20-time major winner Federer, also 41, did the same at the Laver Cup in London. 
Both occasions were full of pomp and ceremony, celebration and reflection. But most of all love.
ration is largely down to their extraordinary success on the court, but also because of their personalities and star quality.
""It is going to be a big void to fill, no question,"" said Merrick Haydon, managing director of international sports marketing agency Revolution's London office.
""Some fans will stay with the game forever because tennis is like all sports: when you're in it you're in it.
""But there are going to be some who will drop away. 
""There is no doubt some won't wake up at 3am to watch matches and may not plan vacations around a tennis major like they used to.""
Before all of Williams' matches in New York there was a buzz outside Arthur Ashe Stadium, with many fans wearing Serena T-shirts in homage to a player who has been a huge inspiration, particularly to African-American women.
Printed slogans included 'Serena. The Woman. The Myth. The Legend' and 'Unapologetic Greatness'. Others simply said 'GOAT'.
mmitment to following Federer was clear at the O2 Arena. 
Fed Heads - an international travelling troupe arriving from places including Switzerland, Japan, Greece, Poland, Thailand and India - were a palette of red and white. 
Caps, T-shirts, scarves, flags, even home-made earrings. And almost all emblazoned with one set of initials: RF.
Federer-loving mother and daughter Kaori and Sakiko Hosokawa, who travelled from near Tokyo, said tennis will not be the same without him. 
""Roger makes my life very wonderful and valuable,"" said Kaori. ""He's the reason I started watching tennis.""
Others claimed they would watch less tennis in the absence of the superstar pair.
""The only reason I watch tennis is because of Serena and Venus, seeing them do their thing,"" said Williams super-fan Jennifer Chenier from Houston, Texas.
Many had travelled thousands of miles to New York and London to see their hero one final time - at great expense.
f tickets for Federer's farewell were available from between £40 and £510. Following the news of his retirement, some of the golden tickets were being offered on resale platforms for more than £1,000 each.
Alex Gough, a self-confessed ""die-hard"" Federer fan from the East Midlands, was one of the dreamers prepared to spend big to be there.
mage to his wallet for one ticket? £600.
""The first 48 hours I wondered if I had spent too much,"" he said. ""I'd been to Wimbledon multiple times but never managed to see Federer because he played on a different day or different court.
""It was the last-chance saloon. It was worth every single penny.""
jet-setters also shell out on travel, hotels, food and the array of high-end merchandise on offer.
re lies another huge hole for the tennis eco-system to fill: the money pit fuelled by Federer and Williams.
global sports market has many sub-categories - including sponsorship, broadcast rights and branding - which combine to create and sell products, whether it is tennis tours, tournaments or individual players.
Whichever way it is analysed, Federer and Williams put bums on seats - in stadiums and in front of televisions - and create wealth in the sport.
""Federer and Williams are brands in their own right, they have transcended tennis as a sport and given it a degree of interest and attention that would not have been achieved without their participation,"" said sports finance expert Kieran Maguire, who works at the University of Liverpool.
""The grace, style, humour and comments of both players have been fantastic for sponsors, who have benefited from endorsement deals with them.
""In addition, tournament organisers have been able to negotiate better deals with broadcasters and commercial partners because 'Serena/Roger is playing', and both players are box office in terms of tickets and viewing figures.""
McEnroe, himself one of the sport's biggest names in the 1980s because of his combustible nature on the court, says sports will always find new stars.
""Tennis goes on no matter what, and we have witnessed that in every sport over time,"" said the American, who was sought out by Nike and marketed as the 'bad boy' of tennis.
""The opportunity is there to market these young kids in a way that I don't think we have successfully done before.""
Spain's Carlos Alcaraz has long been earmarked to be the ATP's next superstar, fulfilling his potential on court by winning the US Open earlier this month and becoming the first teenager to be ranked as the men's world number one.
On the WTA side, Poland's Iga Swiatek has been the dominant player in 2022 and the drive to boost her global appeal included an appearance on a Times Square billboard during the US Open.
Others have also attracted huge attention and could potentially become superstars in the coming years - including Britain's 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu, Japan's four-time major winner Naomi Osaka, American teenager Coco Gauff and Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas.
""Each era has its own heroes and each era thinks the next won't be as good as the present one. But a new generation of superstars always comes through,"" added Haydon.
""This new breed will naturally be marketed differently and social media is the key driver now.
""That happens in two ways: one on pure athletic and sporting achievement, but that has to be aligned with their lifestyle and social environment. England footballer Marcus Rashford and F1 driver George Russell are good examples of that.
""A sport as a whole - players, tournaments, sponsors - must make that happen. It's symbiotic.""
Matteo Berrettini, the Wimbledon runner-up in 2021, is one of the stars of a Netflix access-all-areas documentary which the ATP and WTA hope can create new superstars and take the sport to a different audience.
""Roger brought tennis into the houses of people that probably never watched tennis before,"" said the 26-year-old Italian.
""But I think us younger players shouldn't feel that kind of pressure - me, or all the players that are better than me, even Carlos Alcaraz, who is having an unbelievable season. 
""I think everybody has their own path and you should be proud of what you're doing.""
Federer, who plans to stay around tennis in a yet-to-be-determined capacity, dismisses concerns the sport will struggle without him and Williams.
""The game is bright,"" he insists. ""People thought the same when Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi left - then our generation arrived.""

And it was the top trendingexternal-link Olympic sport on Google Search during its opening day of competition - suggesting it quickly grabbed people's attention.
International Olympic Committee's (IOC) decision to introduce five new sports for Tokyo 2020 was billed as ""the most comprehensive evolution of the Olympic programme"" in modern history.
It was hoped a ""focus on youth"" with baseball, karate, skateboarding, sports climbing and surfing would capture the imagination of viewers around the world and adapt the Games for the 21st Century.
Skateboarding has thrived as young talents - including Britain's 13-year-old bronze medallist Sky Brown - dazzled with world-class skill and inspiring scenes of camaraderie.
But how has climbing, the last of the new sports to make its appearance in Tokyo, fared on its Olympic debut?
ree disciplines of sport climbing are usually tackled separately in elite competition, however in Tokyo they were combined to determine an all-round champion.
In speed climbing, athletes race each other up a 15-metre wall, while bouldering pits the competitors against technical fixed routes that must be tackled within a set time. 
If that was not enough, lead challenges the competitors to climb as high as they can in a single attempt on a 15m wall, within six minutes.
format was described pre-Games by Team GB's sole representative Shauna Coxsey as ""like asking Usain Bolt to run a marathon and then do the hurdles"".
""The scoring is not the best it could be,"" American Colin Duffy said, following a seventh-placed finish in the men's final. ""But in 2024 it will be a different format and hopefully it will work out a little better."" 
ring might be a headache for competitors, but its undoubtedly a spectacle for viewers - and with the average age of the sport's elite athletes being just 21 it certainly fits the IOC's youth objectives too.
On Thursday, 18-year-old Spaniard Alberto Gines Lopez made history by claiming the sport's first Olympic gold, becoming his country's youngest male Olympic champion in the process.
On Friday, Slovenia's Janja Garnbret, 22, claimed gold in the women's event.
maraderie evident at the skateboarding was mirrored at the Aomi Urban Sports Park - noticeably different from some of the fierce rivalries in more established Olympic sports.
""I think it all stems from outdoor climbing when you're climbing with your friends, you're working together to solve a problem and that carries over into competition,"" said American silver medallist Nathaniel Coleman.
""We're able to cheer for our friends, because we see them climbing, we see their struggle and we know how good it feels to do well, so we want that.""
Britain's Coxsey, who first encountered a bouldering wall when she was four-years-old, missed out on Friday's women's final after struggling with injury in qualification.
Despite her personal disappointment, the magnitude of contesting a climbing competition at an Olympics was not lost on Coxsey.
""It's a monumental time for our sport,"" the 28-year-old said. ""It is going to be seen by so many more people. If someone sees climbing and goes and finds something that they absolutely love and have a passion for, that's huge to that individual.
""The professionalisation of the sport is huge. Before me, no-one had ever been a professional competition climber in the UK, so that in itself is a change in the sport.""
Along with surfing and skateboarding, climbing will retain its place at the next Olympics in Paris, a Games which will also witness a debut for breaking - a competitive form of breakdancing.
A total of 40 athletes - 20 men and 20 women - competed for two gold climbing medals in Tokyo, but the sport is set to expand in 2024 when 68 athletes will challenge for four golds, as the speed event becomes a separate discipline.
With climbing walls already present in more than 140 countries, over 35 million climbers around the world, and interest piqued following a first exposure to a truly global audience, these are exciting times in the sport.
""We trained so hard for this, and we were really thankful that we got to show everything that we worked so hard for,"" Austria's men's bronze medallist Jakob Schubert said. 
""It means a lot to win a medal, and now a lot of people in Austria will watch climbing. I hope some more kids from all over the world will find this sport that gives us so much pleasure."""	/sport/olympics/58109892

Norrie came from a set down to beat the 22-time Grand Slam champion 3-6 6-3 6-4 at the Ken Rosewall Arena in Sydney.
27-year-old had lost his four previous meetings with Nadal.
""He'd beaten me easily the last few times, so it's a great way to end the year for me,"" said Norrie.
""I was thinking I'd never won a set before against him and I came out firstly wanting to do that.
""I had to stay super patient. It was a super physical match and I enjoyed it. It was huge to get through that one and finally beat him. It was a crazy match.""
Asked if it was the best win of his career, Norrie said: ""I think it was, especially on ranking and beating a guy like Rafa as the competitor that he is.
""I know it's his first match of the year, but it was a sick win.""
Australian Open champion Nadal, 36, cruised through the first set, but Norrie broke Nadal's serve in the sixth game of the second set and held his own to level the contest.
World number 14 Norrie broke early in the deciding set and saved two break points while leading 3-2 before serving out for victory.
Nadal will attempt to defend his Australian Open title when the first Grand Slam of the year begins in Melbourne on 16 January.
""All credit to him that he did a lot of things very well,"" said Nadal.
""There's a way to improve but I have time before the Australian Open starts in two weeks.""
Swan, 23, also came from a set down as she beat Parrizas-Diaz 3-6 6-1 6-2.
It was a confident performance from the world number 145 Swan, who is ranked 75 places below the 31-year-old Parrizas-Diaz.

sports	Lisa Aitken: Squash star on dealing with disappointment	"Not winning a medal at the Commonwealth Games was by far the lowest point of my career.
For weeks after Birmingham I was angry. I was essentially grieving. 
re was this sense of loss; for the Games, for a medal that never happened, for the time spent building to that moment.
re's a post-Games blues feeling you always get. But this was deeper. It was driven by anger. I was making life awful for my coach. I was going into the gym and throwing weights around.
I was angry at absolutely everything and everyone - and it's those moments that are the most difficult. I think it stemmed from having had a true sense of belief, for the first time in my career. 
Before my two previous Commonwealth Games I did not expect to get a medal, but this time I did. I still believe I was good enough.
Belief is a complicated emotion, because it empowers you but can also make disappointments so much worse. In a way, when you don't achieve what you truly believe you're capable of, you feel like you've betrayed yourself.
It's led me to think that an abundance of athletes go to the Commonwealth Games yet the majority come away without a medal. 
How is everybody else doing? Does everybody else have a support system in place? Are they getting angry on court and smashing their rackets? 
Because all you see is success. All you see are medal winners. 
On social media, it's all about celebrating those who have achieved. I don't want pity, or for people who have achieved not to be celebrated, but I do think we need to have more conversations about the reality of elite sport.
People often talk about channelling these negative emotions. The narrative is that losing is part of sport, so just roll with the punches and get on with it.
's fine - but we need to speak about it more. Athletes need to be comfortable being vulnerable enough to say ""Hey, I lost, and I feel awful"".
Everybody can't wait to celebrate and showcase their success. But when they've lost, they're hiding. They're not saying anything about how they're feeling. They're not putting up any pictures. 
're not putting up any kind of reflections, because there's a sense of embarrassment or a deeper vulnerability that they're just not willing to share.
If we don't show the bad stuff as well as the good, we're failing to prepare the next generation.
As a kid choosing to play squash as a career, nobody ever said: ""By the way, it's going to be brutal. It's going to be awful. 
""You're going to be so low at times, you won't know how to get out of bed. You're going to have no money at times, you won't know how you're going to feed yourself.
""You're going to go on court thinking 'If I don't win this, I can't afford to go to the next tournament'. You're going to have sleepless nights crying."" 
Everyone tells you it's a luxury, it's a privilege. And it is those things, too. But growing up there was nobody on social media telling me about how bad it could really get.
goes for people who do win medals, too. Because as time goes by, the attention and the glory fades. They need support as well.
I don't want to be doom and gloom, because that's not who I am. I don't really like to focus on the negatives.
But I want to show other athletes and young people how tough it can be, and that it's OK to feel low. It's OK to be vulnerable about your losses and normalise those conversations and emotions.
It can't just be: 'I've won, let's get this on social media. Let's show the world how great I am'.
Be recognised for the bad stuff as well, because we're human. The bad stuff doesn't need to be called the bad stuff. It's just part of life.

sports	Wimbledon: What the data says about some tennis 'myths'	"During the first set of the first match at Wimbledon next week, the commentator will invariably mention that the server will be using the 'new balls'.
After the opening seven games, and then after every nine more, the old balls are removed and replaced by new ones. The popular opinion is that the new, firmer balls, give an immediate advantage to the server, something that diminishes game by game until they are replaced.
But is this true?
Dutch professors Franc Klaassen and Jan R. Magnus decided to find out if it was and set about examining as many tennis 'myths' as they could. 
""The list [of myths] originated from watching tennis on TV and listening to commentators,"" Professor Klaassen explains. ""And we combined it with our own extensive experience as tennis players."" 
What followed was 25 years of research, academic papers and a book.
work included data from 86,298 points played at Wimbledon and expanded to well over 100,000 points played at other Grand Slam events, with data gathered from the 1990s up until the present day. 
So what did they find and will it make us watch the game in a different way?
One of the fundamental questions, which followed on from research that dated back to the 1970s, was whether or not points are independent of each other. 
Does the previous point have any influence on the one being played now?
findings were clear and they confirmed that all points are not equal, although the difference between them is small. 
formation was paired with the idea that an ace could be worth more than one point. The prevailing wisdom was that serving an ace gave the server so much more confidence that they would be more likely to win the next point.
wed that in men's singles there was an effect and following an ace the server was more likely to win the following point to the tune of the ace being worth 1.04 points, and in women's singles the effect was worth 1.01 points. 
margins are small, but sometimes that is enough to change the outcome of a point and so a game, and ultimately a match.
If points aren't equal, what about games? 
rofessors knew that legendary BBC commentator Dan Maskell would often say that the seventh game of a set was the most important one, and whoever won it would be most likely to win the set.
was found to be untrue, and that the most important games are numbers 11, 12 and 13 (the tie-break) if the set goes that far. 
game could come with the scores at 5-1, 4-2, 3-3, 2-4 or 1-5. You might think that at 3-3 the seventh game is important, but data shows that it isn't. In fact the seventh game has less bearing on the set than the sixth.
rofessors came up with an ""importance"" measure to rank each game 1-100. Game six scored 43.0 in men's singles and 41.3 in women's, while game seven scored 37.6 in men's and 36.6 in women's. 
""importance"" was the probability that the server in that game wins the set given that they win the game, minus the probability that the server wins the set given that they lose the game. 
Klaassen and Magnus analysed what happens at the 'big points' and chose break points and game points to consider. 
found that in both men's and women's singles, the number of aces went up at game point but so did the number of double faults.
utcome was that the total points won on serve at game point was slightly less than at all other points. Men's servers won 62.2% of points at break point compared to 65% of all points, while women won 53.5% at break point compared to 56.4% of all points. .
When game point is match point, or even Championship point, the stakes are obviously higher. 
reased aces and double faults at this point were never more tense than at the end of the 2001 final between Goran Ivanisevic and Pat Rafter. The big-serving Croat led 8-7 in the fifth set but served two aces and three double faults at crucial moments before finally capturing the crown in his fourth final. 
At break point players serve fewer aces, taking more care to make sure they get the ball in play and playing more cautiously. 
So does a player who wins a break of serve, relax and the player who has just been broken try extra hard to mean that a break-back happens right away? 
wer was no. Overall a player is more likely to hold their own service having made a break.
Men are 81.8% likely to hold serve, which rises to 83.3% after a break. For women, it's 64.3% normally and rising to 68.3% after a break.
Having previously looked at the effect of a point on the next one, they looked at the effect of winning a game on the following one. 
Do players gain momentum, or as they called it, a 'winning mood'?
was the most surprising finding. 
""The winning mood is much smaller than we thought it would be,"" explains Professor Klaassen. ""Yes, there is momentum, doing well at recent points signals that the player will also do well at the current point. But this momentum is small.""
How would this translate to the thinking that a player who wins a set to even a match and require a decisive fifth (men's) or third (women's) set, would they have the advantage? 
was split into seeds and non-seeds and gave clear results. 
When two seeds play, the winner of the fourth set most probably loses the fifth (an 11.1% probability of the same player winning sets four and five).
But when two non-seeds play it's the opposite as the winner of the fourth is most likely to also win the fifth (a 60% chance of the same player winning sets four and five). 
When a seed plays a non-seed the winner of the fourth set is irrelevant as the seeded player is more likely to win the final set no matter what happened before (an 80% probability of the seed winning sets four and five).
figures are the same for women going into a third set. 
Looking at the 20 men's Wimbledon finals since the millennium, six have gone the distance to five sets. In every one, the player who won the fourth set to draw level, then lost the fifth. 
wice Roger Federer triumphed this way (2007 v Nadal and 2009 v Roddick), but three times he lost (2008 v Nadal and 2014 and 2019 v Djokovic).
xplain a lot about what happens in tennis, but what about the new balls? 
Klaassen and Magnus found that slightly more aces are served by men when using the new balls (10% with new balls, 9.1% when not), but alongside this there is an increase in double faults (5.9% with new balls, 5.5% without). 
So the new balls go faster to produce the aces but are harder to control, hence the double faults. 
It isn't an easy answer, there are shades of grey. However, when the commentator reminds us that the server has the new balls, we do know that 'something' is going to happen more than usual."	/sport/tennis/61864893
sports	Roger Federer retires: Swiss great played tennis with a balletic grace beyond modern compare	"I was barely a month into this job when I suggested Roger Federer would never win another Grand Slam title.
17-time Grand Slam champion had just turned 32, lost to Sergiy Stakhovsky in the second round of Wimbledon (thus ending a run of 36 consecutive major quarter-finals), and then in straight sets to Tommy Robredo in the last 16 of the US Open.
Put it down, perhaps, to the impetuosity of inexperience, and also to unawareness of a significant back problem, which Federer later detailed.
Not that it was remotely controversial, nine years ago, to suggest the best days of a tennis player in their thirties might be behind them. It is just that since then Federer and Serena Williams, with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic now following their lead, have overturned convention and expectation.
""I get inspired in a big way by the likes of Usain Bolt or Michael Jordan or LeBron James or Valentino Rossi or Michael Schumacher: guys who did things for a very long time at the highest of levels,"" he told me after winning an eighth Wimbledon title, a month before turning 36, in 2017.
""I would marvel at what they did when I was younger. I couldn't understand how they would get match ready day in day out, practise every single day and how they would give it 100%. I struggled with that in a big way when I was younger."" 
Federer also struggled with his fitness and his temper - racquet throwing, tears and profanities were not at all uncommon in his teenage years. But two new relationships forged in 2000 made quite a difference.
He started working with the fitness coach Pierre Paganini, whom he had first met at the Swiss national training centre a few years earlier. The partnership has endured for Federer's entire career.
And he also met Mirka, who would become his wife nine years later. They both represented Switzerland at that year's Sydney Olympics, and played mixed doubles together at the 2002 Hopman Cup. Mirka's career was ended by a foot injury later that year, but she swiftly became the ""rock"" in his life. 
Federer's most golden spell was between Wimbledon 2003 and the Australian Open of 2010. He won 16 of the 27 Grand Slam tournaments played in that time (and reached the final of another six). But the autumnal years of his career also had a golden hue.
Most remarkable of all was his run to the 2017 Australian Open title, achieved by beating four top-10 players and winning three matches over five sets, despite being 35 and missing the previous six months because of knee surgery.
Federer was playing with a refurbished knee - and backhand. A switch to a larger racquet a couple of years previously was now paying dividends, offering him more power and spin, and more success against Nadal, whom he beat in the final.
An eighth Wimbledon title followed in the summer, a 20th Grand Slam in Melbourne the following January, and if Djokovic had not been able to save two championship points on Centre Court in the Wimbledon final of 2019, Federer would have become the oldest player to win a Grand Slam in the Open era.
So many memories. None perhaps more special than winning his one and only French Open, in 2009, to become only the sixth man in history (at that stage) to complete the career Grand Slam. 
French crowds were desperate for him to win that Roland Garros final against Robin Soderling, and many seemed conflicted when Switzerland took on France in the Davis Cup final of 2014. A world record tennis crowd of 27,448 crammed in under the retractable roof of Stade Pierre Mauroy in Lille to see Federer win the famous team competition for the one and only time.
Interviewing Federer was invariably a pleasure - albeit with perhaps one exception, just a few days before that Davis Cup final. The previous Saturday night, at the ATP Finals in London, Federer had survived four match points to beat his Swiss team-mate Stan Wawrinka in the semi-finals. But Wawrinka had been very unhappy with what Mirka had been shouting from the stands during the match, and the two exchanged more than a few words in the locker room afterwards. 
wo days later, I was the only English-speaking journalist in the first Swiss team news conference of the week in Lille. They started with questions in English. There was only one topic an English-speaking audience wanted to hear about. It certainly wasn't the one topic Federer wanted to talk about. But, as ever, he replied - even if his customary politeness was laced with a hint of irritation.
ut the greatest of all time is in the eye of the beholder. Federer has, statistically, been overtaken by Williams, Nadal and Djokovic, but played the game with a balletic grace beyond modern compare. He had balance and coordination in spades; he had an iron forehand with a velvet touch; and the footwork of Muhammad Ali. 
Federer says he used to cry after every match he lost until the age of 15, and so it came as quite a surprise when he eventually started crying after winning.
And that was a big part of his enduring appeal. The tennis he played may not have been relatable, but his warm and emotional character certainly was."	/sport/tennis/62985363

Phillies beat the San Diego Padres 4-3 in Philadelphia to win the National League Championship Series 4-1.
After a rain delay in the Bronx, the Astros edged out the New York Yankees 6-5 to sweep the American League Championship Series 4-0.
-of-seven World Series will begin in Houston on Friday.
Because the Astros have the superior regular-season record, they will enjoy home field advantage, with four of the seven games at Minute Maid Park.
After finishing with the best record in the American League, Houston are yet to lose a postseason game in 2022, sweeping the Seattle Mariners 3-0 in the Division Series before overwhelming the Yankees.
Star outfielder Aaron Judge, who broke the AL home run record at the start of October, again struggled at the plate and went hitless in what could be his final Yankees game as he now qualifies for free agency.
Astros were indebted to shortstop Jeremy Pena at Yankee Stadium after the rookie hit a three-run homer to left field in the top of the third inning to tie the game at 3-3 - and was later driven in by Alex Bregman in the seventh for the go-ahead run to make it 6-5.
Judge came up to bat in the bottom of the ninth with the Yankees down to their last out, but he could only ground out to Astros closer Ryan Pressly, who flipped the ball to first base as Houston booked their fourth World Series appearance in six seasons.
Earlier, the Phillies were celebrating on home turf at Citizens Bank Park as they saw off the Padres to reach the 'Fall Classic' for the first time since 2009.
Designated hitter Bryce Harper, who hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the eighth inning to bring the Phillies back from 3-2 down, was named as the most valuable player of the NLCS.
Philadelphia had been the lowest-ranked NL team to qualify for the postseason, but overcame the St Louis Cardinals 2-0 in their Wild Card series, and then the defending champion Atlanta Braves 3-1 in the NL Division Series.

sports	Commonwealth Games: What has changed for indigenous people since Cathy Freeman's triumph?	"As the curtain came down on the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, eyes began to turn to Victoria - the host of the 2026 event.
Indigenous elders from Australia performed a smoking ceremony as the Birmingham Games came to a close - handing over message sticks to organisers.
It was a moment of inclusion that underlined how things have changed since Australian sprinting legend Cathy Freeman won gold at the 1994 Games.
She was 21 then and having a breakthrough year in athletics. At the Commonwealth Games in British Columbia she won both the  200m and the 400m, but during those Games, she experienced something that would become part of sporting history. 
Freeman celebrated her 400m win by running a victory lap while carrying the Aborginal flag. Australia's chef de mission for the Games, Arthur Turnstall, responded with a public statement reprimanding her and warned if she did it again, she would be sent home. 
""She should have carried the Australian flag first up, and [we should have] not seen the Aboriginal flag at all,"" he told media.
Defiantly, after winning the 200m days later, Freeman once again carried the Aboriginal flag, this time tied with the Australian flag, to represent her identity and heritage. 
Freeman's success on the track and passion to represent her people off it made her an Aboriginal icon, as well as a symbol of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. 
was nearly 30 years ago. 
So how much have things changed for Indigenous athletes competing at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, and what does the event mean to them? 
Ash Gardner was part of the gold medal-winning Australian cricket team at Birmingham. She told BBC Sport her heritage and culture plays a huge part in her identity as a cricketer. 
""I'm a proud Marwari woman,"" she said. ""I love being able to represent not only myself, but my culture and my people as well."" 
Gardner says while she didn't have many Aboriginal role models growing up, Freeman was certainly one of them. 
""She was an absolute superstar in her field, and you just have to look up to those types of people and know that things are achievable,"" added the 25-year-old.
""Wearing that flag was something that was pretty incredible, and something that she should be really proud of. Knowing the backlash that she copped, and still sticking to her guns, was a really significant thing. 
""It's who the First Nations people of Australia are and that's who was there before anyone else.""
So, before coming to an event like the Commonwealth Games, which has such strong links to colonialism, did Gardner think about its history? 
""It certainly crossed my mind,"" she admitted. ""You just have to look at the history of Australia and what happened there and knowing that, obviously a lot of that has come from colonisation. I think a lot of people probably don't understand that.
""But we can look at it and celebrate who the First Nations people are from all different countries around the world, especially Commonwealth countries."" 
But for Indigenous people all over the world, what exactly are the barriers to playing sport?  
Janice Forsyth, professor in the Faculty of Education at the University of British Columbia, specialises in sport's relationship to Indigenous and Canadian culture.  
""Sport is very expensive, it costs a lot of money, and many Indigenous families don't have that kind of money,"" she told BBC Sport. 
""In addition, there's racism and other forms of discrimination that make it an unwelcoming place for indigenous athletes.
""And the discrimination can be overt, with name calling, or it can be much more subtle. A lot of times, people just don't know how to address it, because it is so systemic.""
Another reason there are so few Indigenous elite athletes, she says, is because their communities were trying to address the colonialism and the generational trauma of it in their everyday lives. 
""Many athletes in the mainstream system, especially those who are privileged, didn't have to experience that."" 
Ash Gardner says that can be ""taxing"".  
""We feel like we have to educate everyone on who we are and what our issues are,"" she added.
""Obviously it's up to people to go and do their own research. But I guess the thing that's changing in Australia at the moment is people are actually going out there and educating and it's coming from the top.""
Another Indigenous athlete who competed and won a medal at the Commonwealth Games is hammer thrower Jillian Weir from Canada. 
Weir's dad Robert was born in Birmingham and competed for Birchfield Harriers. He was a 12-time British champion in the discus and won four Commonwealth Games medals over a 20-year period, including two golds. 
While Robert has Jamaican roots, Weir's mum has Indigenous Canadian heritage. 
""There's a fighter spirit in me from my ancestors,"" she told BBC Sport. 
29-year-old says looking at the Games from a historical point of view is difficult.
""I come into this as another competition,"" she added. ""And I want to do my best to represent my background as best as I can.

""To have an Indigenous background and to be here, to medal at the Commonwealth Games, it means the world.
""I'm just trying to represent the best that I can and if I can bring attention to some of the wrongdoings of indigenous people, that's what I want to do. To highlight indigenous backgrounds and indigenous stories."" 
Like Gardner, Weir also sees the barriers that Indigenous athletes face in her country, including lack of representation and opportunities. 
""And typically indigenous people - especially the ones that still live on reservations in Canada - maybe don't have the highest socio-economic status,"" she added. ""To be able to go join a sport and to pay money to be able to participate can be quite difficult."" 
Forsyth says the issues of indigenous people in sport can be traced all the way back to when European settlers first arrived in North America with their own sports and games.
""They thought those were the sports and games that Indigenous people should be playing in Canada, the United States and Australia,"" she said. ""And so they tried to encourage indigenous people to pick up those sports.
""They did this in a number of ways. In Canada, they did it through the Indian Act, outlawing indigenous physical practices. They did it through the boarding schools and the residential schools. They continue to do it by funding certain sports which aren't necessarily indigenous derived."" 
Forsyth says laws which divorced indigenous people from their own culture are another reason there are still so few indigenous athletes in mainstream sports.

31-year-old, who competes in the men's foil event, won silver at the 2019 World Championships.
He also helped GB win the team gold at the inaugural European Games in 2015.
""Marcus' determination and consistency has been incredible to watch over recent years,"" said Team GB's chef de mission Mark England.
""This has ensured that Team GB can be represented in fencing at another Olympic Games - something Marcus should be very proud of.""
Mepstead, whose current world ranking is 14, was part of a four-man British squad at the 2016 Rio Olympics that finished sixth in the team event.
Find out how to get into fencing with our special guide.
After fencing lost its funding from UK Sport in 2017, he has battled to keep his career alive, establishing a personal training business and moving to New York to work with a world-class coach.
""Marcus has been on an incredible journey on the way to securing his qualification for Tokyo,"" said British Fencing Olympic team manager Johnny Davis.
""Faced with challenging financial and logistical circumstances, Marcus met the challenge head on and created a world-class environment and culture which has underpinned his qualification for Tokyo.
""Securing one of the two available individual automatic European qualification slots for the Olympics is arguably the most difficult route to Olympic qualification.

sports	Steven Lopez: America's double Olympic taekwondo champion has life ban overturned	"Double Olympic champion Steven Lopez has had his life ban overturned on appeal by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
American Lopez was banned from the sport in September 2018 following sexual abuse claims.
He and his brother, Jean, were banned by the United States' Center for SafeSport.
But the brothers have now had their bans lifted having challenged the ruling.
rothers' suspensions were originally lifted on appeal, but World Taekwondo, the sport's world governing body, kept them in place. 
However, having unsuccessfully challenging WT's decision, the Lopez brothers appealed to CAS in June 2022.
A CAS panel found that WT charged the brothers based on its 2011 code of ethics.  However, because the incidents for which they were charged took place before 2011, they deemed this code could not be used.
At a CAS hearing, WT submitted a 2008 code of ethics for the first time, but the panel considered this to be ""inadmissibly, and impermissibly, late"", and said insufficient evidence was provided to prove this edition of the code of ethics was published or made available to athletes.
In upholding the Lopez brothers' appeal, CAS said in a statement: ""In application of the fundamental legal principle that one cannot be punished for doing something that is not prohibited by law, and in the absence of any relevant applicable disciplinary or ethics rules implemented or published by WT at the time of the alleged violations, the CAS Panel was not in a position to sanction the appellants, even if the Panel was to assume that they had committed an infraction.""
Lopez brothers were named in a lawsuit filed in 2018 by four female taekwondo athletes who claim to have suffered ""two decades of sexual abuse, exploitation and trafficking by the entities, officials, coaches and mentors who were entrusted to protect them"".
Both brothers have always denied all allegations against them.

sports	Running with the Hadza - the race celebrating a way of life	"A fire crackles just after dawn in north Tanzania's bushlands. The sun is starting to rise over the Yaeda Valley and the start of a new day means one thing for the Hadza tribe. It's time to begin their daily ritual of finding the food that will sustain them until next sunrise.
For the women, this means heading out with long wooden sticks to forage for berries and dig for edible tubers. For the men, it's a time to hunt. With handmade bows and arrows, they will cover up to 40km on foot by midday.
In the summer of 2023 a group of ultra-marathon runners will arrive on Hadza land for an 80km race. Competitors will use Hadza survival skills to sustain themselves.
re will be no feed zones or energy gels. Runners won't be allowed to bring supplies. Water will have to be gathered from natural rainwater cisterns in baobab trees while the trees' fruit will be among their energy sources.
Hadza tribe have been living this way in this region for thousands of years. They are one of the world's few remaining hunter-gatherer tribes. They live sustainably day-to-day off their native land in the Yaeda Valley, don't hoard food or resources and have no history of famine.
However, their population has diminished to 1,300 because of encroachment from pastoral tribes and farming settlements. They have lost 90% of their land since the 1960s.
""When I was a child there were no other tribes in the area up to 80km from here,"" tribe elder Maroba says as he sits on a rock overlooking the valley.
""The game that was here then - everything from elephant, giraffe, zebra, wildebeest - was plentiful for hunting. Slowly that changed and people started moving in.""
race will take place during the dry season, when the landscape looks barren and unforgiving. But the Hadza women emphasise there is an abundance of food if you know where to look. During a morning forage, Apooa shows us a greyish looking branch that signals there are edible tubers underneath. She says: ""We're digging for makalitako and this food will sustain us until this evening.""
Early the next morning we're about to experience first-hand some of the course with two tribe members, Moshi and Sindano.
Hadza are an entirely egalitarian society in relation to gender and age. However, there's a definite hierarchy in the expertise in our running group.
With a bow and arrow in one hand and the other in his pocket, Moshi is moving fast over rocky, uneven, hilly terrain with Sindano, alert to any potential hunting opportunity. You've got to run to keep up.
Earlier that morning, the route of next year's race was explained to Moshi by Mika Peterson, our guide and translator from the Dorobo Fund,external-link a conservation arm of Dorobo Safaris that works with the Hadza to retain land rights. He will work with ultra-marathon expert Josue Stephens and his company Barefoot Adventures to organise the race, which doesn't have a name yet.
Hadza don't use kilometres or miles. Mika - switching between Swahili and the Hadza's click language, Hadzane - explains the route using well-known Hadza landmarks.
""Researchers have put trackers on Hadza people and it is very common for a Hadza to go off hunting and do 30 or 40km in a morning,"" says Daudi Peterson, Mika's father, who has been working with the Hadza since the 1990s.
Race organiser Stephens has spent extended periods of his life running with the Tarahuma tribe in Mexico, subject of the best-selling book Born to Run by Christopher McDougall. He was drawn to organising a race with the Hadza in part by their athlete-like endurance.
Studies have shown that a typical Hadza tribe member completes the UK's recommended weekly guidance for exercise - 150 minutes - every day. They have also found the Hadza have enviable heart health, with low blood pressure and cholesterol levels, even in old age.
Some members of the Hadza group tell us they would like to do the race, with Mika adding: ""Someone like Moshi, we'll probably ask to stay near the back to help anyone who is struggling.""
It will be a tough course for the 50 to 100 racers expected to compete.
Eighty kilometres in temperatures over 30C at 1,300m altitude (the same as the UK's highest mountain Ben Nevis) will be difficult enough. The racers will also forage for wild berries, dig for tubers, hand-make arrows, harvest honey and climb the baobab trees for water and fruit.
""For the racers, those challenges are going to take a really long time, but I am going to be able to do them really quickly,"" Moshi says.
You can spot the ubiquitous baobab trees from any vantage point in the valley. Their thick trunks give them the appearance of water hydrants. 
known across Africa as the tree of life and for good reason. It's one of the world's largest succulents and can store more than 100,000 litres of water during the rainy season. Its citrus fruit is a well known superfood with six times more vitamin C than an orange.
Mika says: ""The baobab will be the main sustaining food for the race. Racers cannot bring any of their own food and will have to obtain food and drink with skills they learn from the Hadza.""
Midway through a morning hunt on our penultimate day in the valley we stopped to practise our baobab harvesting skills (also known as throwing sticks to knock the fruit off its branches). Moshi is again at the fore, laughing, smiling and teaching us the traditional Hadza hello.
'Am I yega' translates as 'are you alive?'
Earlier, Moshi had been smoking out killer bees from their hive for honey. It took him minutes to make a small fire, using the friction from branches in a hand-drill technique and dried grass as kindling. Racers will also have to master this for roasting tubers and warmth at night.
Just to the right of us is a piece of wood painted white on one side and green on the other. It's about a metre high and is a boundary marker.
flaking paint draws the lines of Hadza territory and marks where pastoral Datoga tribes are allowed on to Hadza land at certain times of year for cattle grazing.
Some of the race proceeds will be paid directly to the Hadza, for use of their land and the sharing of their survival skills. They spend money on healthcare, education and settling land disputes. They have lived in this region for tens of thousands of years, but only since 2003 has their traditional territory been officially assigned to them under Tanzanian law.
On our final afternoon with the Hadza, we spent some time sitting on a huge rock overlooking the Yaeda Valley with Maroba. Asked how the valley has changed in his lifetime, Maroba began a long story, his arms pointing in various directions as he explained the different areas on the horizon, which used to be Hadza land.
When he had finished talking, we asked how he felt about the encroaching rival tribes.
He smiled and, with characteristic Hadza compassion, says: ""It's become a lot harder to be able to live off the land than when I was a child.
""The increase of people and pressure, even if we do have these designated areas that have some kind of protection, make it so hard to hunt. The way it is going is not looking too pretty, but those people need to make a living as well."""	/sport/63958092

""I demonstrated bad judgement and I am sorry,"" he said.
27-year-old became a local sporting hero when he won the country's first Olympic gold at the 2016 Rio Games.
But the scandal has now divided opinion in a country known for its strict drug laws.
Many expressed sympathy for the national swimmer, noting that his father had died last November and he was facing immense pressure as an athlete. 
""Every young person makes mistakes,"" one person commented on an article about the case. Another wrote: ""This is a nothingburger. Many have tried it overseas.""
However, there were also those who condemned Mr Schooling. 
""It is totally unacceptable as a top sportsman who is supposed to be a national role model,"" a Facebook commenter said. 
Singapore bans the consumption of drugs within its territory and also prosecutes those who take drugs abroad. Citizens or permanent residents who fail urine tests for illegal drugs face up to 10 years in prison and a S$20,000 ($14,300; £12,300) fine.
It also has a mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking, which has become increasingly controversial as more young Singaporeans begin to speak up against capital punishment.
In a statement, Mr Schooling apologised that his actions caused hurt to his family and young fans who looked up to him. 
""I gave in to a moment of weakness after going through a very tough period of my life,"" he said.
Another national swimmer, 29-year-old Amanda Lim, also admitted to consuming cannabis. She was given a warning by the Central Narcotics Bureau after an investigation.
""There is no excuse, and I will take the warning given to me seriously and reflect on my mistakes,"" she said in a statement.
Singapore's Ministry of Defence said on Tuesday that Mr Schooling had passed the urine drugs test, but that the star had confessed to taking cannabis while he was on a break from his military service to train and participate in the Southeast Asian Games in Hanoi in May. Cannabis use is also illegal in Vietnam.
Given the ""abuse of disruption privileges"", Mr Schooling will no longer be able to take leave or disrupt his military service to train or compete, the ministry said. 
He will also be put on a supervised urine test regime for six months and could be sentenced to up to nine months' detention in military detention barracks if he tests positive.
All male Singaporean citizens and permanent residents have to serve about two years of full-time military service, usually starting when they are 18, unless they are exempted.
rt date for Mr Schooling's military service was deferred multiple times so he could compete in international competitions, before he enlisted in January this year.

sports	Transgender athletes: What do the scientists say?	"Is there an unfair advantage? Should transgender women be banned from competing in female categories? Should there be a separate category established? Or should sport be more inclusive?
rsation around the inclusion of transgender women in women's sport is one that has divided opinion both in and out of the sporting sphere, even drawing comment from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
res around the balance of inclusion, sporting fairness and safety in women's sport - essentially, whether trans women can compete in female categories without their biological sex giving them an unfair advantage or presenting a threat of injury to other competitors.
As part of The Sports Desk podcast's look at the debate, BBC Sport spoke to two scientists who offer views from opposing sides.
Here, Tucker and Harper answer the key questions being debated from a science perspective. You will also hear from Dr Seema Patel, a lawyer who argues other factors - such as human rights - must be considered.
Harper: Advantages are not necessarily unfair, and let me use two examples, one where the advantages aren't unfair and one where they are.
Left-handed athletes have advantages over right-handed athletes in many sports. It is perhaps most marked in fencing where 40% of elite fencers are left-handed versus 10% of the population is left-handed.
But right-handed fencers and left-handed fencers can engage in meaningful competition despite the advantages that left-handed fencers have.
However, you never put a big boxer in the ring with a little boxer, no matter how good the little boxer is. No matter how hard the little boxer works, trains, how competitive they are, they can't beat a big boxer. The size difference means there's no such thing as meaningful competition between big boxers and little boxers.
So the question isn't 'do trans women have advantages?' - but instead, 'can trans women and women compete against one another in meaningful competition?' Truthfully, the answer isn't definitive yet.
rans women can have disadvantages because their larger frames are now being powered by reduced muscle mass and reduced aerobic capacity, but that's not as obvious as the advantages of simply being bigger.
Yes, it's true that competition can often come down to a very small margin, but there are, in any competition, many factors that come into overall performance and just saying that 'oh, somebody has an advantage' in one factor doesn't necessarily determine the outcome. 
ucker: When boys reach the age of 13-14, things start to change physically and we see increased muscle mass, bone density; [it] changes the shape of the skeleton, changes the heart and the lung, haemoglobin levels, and all of those things are significant contributors to performance. 
Lowering the testosterone has some effect on those systems, but it's not complete, and so for the most part, whatever the biological differences are that were created by testosterone persist even in the presence of testosterone reduction - or, if I put that differently, even after testosterone levels are lowered. 
It leaves behind a significant portion of what gives males sporting performance advantages over females.
ucker: The point of the women's category is to exclude male advantage, which comes as a result of testosterone.
Until it can be shown that that advantage doesn't persist or exist in trans women, then I would say that there's no basis to allow trans women in. 
f all that is that if there were no evidence at all, I would say that an exclusion policy would be the prudent start point.
However, we do have evidence - we have 13 studies that show significant retained advantage. We have a number of other studies of males with lower testosterone levels with prostate cancer, we know what happens with training, and so I think collectively the picture is quite strong to suggest that advantages are retained.
Finally, I think that what that leads to is the prediction that over time you will see athletes like Lia Thomas and Emily Bridges, so they are in effect the manifestation of what we know will happen physiologically. 
So I would be quite confident at this point that a policy that regulates women's sport by excluding male advantage, which includes trans women, is the evidence-based one. 
It's not impossible that in time evidence will emerge to challenge that and then we can reconsider that, but I think [the IOC] got it backwards in the beginning by allowing it in until proven otherwise. It should have been excluded until it could be shown that the advantages can be removed. 
Harper: The science is in its infancy and we are not going to have definitive answers for probably 20 years.
re are some, including the IOC, that have said until we know [more] we shouldn't restrict trans athletes.
What I would say is that until we know for sure, sport's governing bodies should do the best they can with the data that exists, with the knowledge that we have today, with the understanding that any policy they create now should be subject to change one we get more data.
So for instance, World Athletics has said that once transgender women reduce testosterone for 12 months, they should be allowed in. That's not a perfect policy - nobody is saying it is - but World Athletics has said this is the best we can do with the available science.
I think is a more reasonable approach than either saying there shouldn't be any restrictions on trans women or we shouldn't let trans women in until we know for certain.
Harper: In recreational sports, we should be creative; we can look at different ways of dividing. Do we need a male and female category in every case? Could we separate in other ways? Perhaps there may be cases where there is a third category that might be effective.
But the problem is if you strictly require all trans athletes to go into a trans category, then you have three categories - one with 49.5% of humanity, the other with 49.5% of humanity, and one with 1% of humanity.
So is the UK going to be able to field a transgender football team? And if so, will any other country field a transgender football team? Will the UK transgender football team have anybody to play?
In team sports especially, it's virtually impossible to consider a transgender category - it's not going to work in elite sport.
re are situations where it might be beneficial to be flexible and look outside the male/female dichotomy.
When we separate into categories, we don't necessarily eliminate advantages, but we reduce them to the point where anyone who is in the category can enjoy meaningful competition with anyone else in the category.
rue when we subdivide into male and female. If we want to see women winning Olympic gold medals or earning professional sports contracts then we can't be having men in the category.
Can we have trans women who have gone through male puberty in the category? That, admittedly, is not yet a settled question. 
ucker: It might be that in the future - that's where we head to. 
It would in some respects be quite a positive step, but I don't think that the world is really ready for that, and I don't just mean the sports world. 
us problem is there would be so few athletes that I'm not sure they would be able to sustain a sporting competition or even a category that is viable.
r problem is that there is still a lot of stigma attached to being trans and I'm not sure that trying to force or create a platform through sport would help overcome that. If anything, there might be certain barriers that are created. 
re are some countries in the world where it would be deemed illegal, so I'm not sure that society is necessarily ready for that and that it would be fair. 
, I think it might be a solution at some point in the future, but I just don't think that we are necessarily there yet. 
Harper: Trans women are never going to take over women's sport. First of all, trans people make up roughly 1% of the population. 
xample of a population study to look at comes from America. If you look at NCAA sports, there are more than 200,000 women competing every year in NCAA sports. Trans women make up 0.5-1% of the population so we should be seeing 1,000-2,000 trans women every year.
NCAA 11 years ago allowed trans women to compete, based on hormone therapy. We should be seeing 1,000-2,000. We see a handful every year.
So 11 years after these hormone-therapy-based rules went into effect, trans women are not taking over NCAA sports. They are still hugely under-represented. 
ucker: The problem is one of concept - not scale and number - and if you ask women about that, they'll say 'well, how many would you accept?' Would you accept five? Would you accept 10? Does it need to be 50? 
We've had a handful [of transgender women athletes] in the last while. There are a number of others in the United States who might not be receiving global attention, but they're certainly winning titles in the US. 
And again, they're taking places from women within the women's sports category, so playing the numbers game to me seems really dangerous because by 2028, at the Olympic Games beyond Paris, we could be seeing half a dozen, maybe a dozen. Who knows? 
It seems to be a problem that's only growing.
New guidance from the International Olympic Committee in November states there should be no assumption that a transgender athlete automatically has an unfair advantage in female sporting events. It invites individual sports to find the right approach.
ucker: It's quite clear that the IOC from the very beginning was intent on finding inclusion at the expense of the integrity of women's sport.
Where the IOC are now is that they've compromised it even further. No presumption of advantage - it's an extraordinary statement at a time when they have more knowledge than they would have had even seven, eight years ago.
So, despite the fact that we now know more, all the evidence, as I mentioned previously, points towards retained advantage, never mind existence of advantage in the first place, and yet they've gone in the direction of saying that we no longer need to measure testosterone, so there is a fundamental failure of scientific integrity on the part of the IOC. 
Most Olympic sports don't have the capacity to make this decision, let alone the evidence, so I think the IOC has failed in its leadership by not giving them a stronger framework with which to work.
've gone with a scientifically bereft policy guideline and now sports will have to sort it out as this problem continues to grow.
Harper: The new IOC framework doesn't provide enough substance, and certainly saying there shouldn't be any restrictions until we have data, I don't agree with that. 
IOC has prioritised inclusion, and I think inclusion is valuable, but again I would prefer the example of World Athletics, which is taking a more proactive stance, where they have said this is what we think we should do, we know it won't work for all sports, but they are showing more leadership. In that sense it is possible to criticise the IOC.
rying to create transgender policy is extremely challenging - you can criticise anybody for any policy that they have.
I certainly wish the IOC had done something other than what they did do, but it's also true that both trans women and cis women have been put in a very difficult spot.
Sports governing bodies have also been put in a very difficult spot, and we should have some sympathy too.
Harper: I have met Emily Bridges - she's 21 years old. She's a world-class athlete. She should be free to do her sport and go to uni and live a normal life.
Now, she has the weight of the world on her shoulders, people are debating her all across the world, she's been called some horrible things, there are some people who think she's a heroine, and she just wants to ride her bike, go to uni, have friends.
She's been devastated by this, and it's heartbreaking to see what has happened to Emily.
It is really hard to see on a personal level somebody you know go through this level of suffering.
ucker: What happened with the Bridges situation is a perfect illustration of the mess that sports have got themselves into and the reason that that exists is because, simply put, they haven't listened to their own athletes.
I'm uncomfortable at times with the way the conversation goes when it starts to talk about individuals, and you'll hear people saying that they're deliberately cheating; they're only identifying as women in order to win women's sports or to get into changing rooms and so forth. 
I find those kinds of - if you can even call them contributions to the debate - very uncomfortable and sometimes unpleasant. I wish that we could have this debate impersonally and without ever having to refer to individuals, because I think it is unfair on them and they're abiding by the rules. The rules are the problem. 
Now I don't know that that's enough to exempt individuals from the consequences of their own decisions and so forth, but I do think that we could have this conversation without needing to have exhibit A, exhibit B, exhibit C. It's quite invasive and sometimes unpleasant. 
I would really encourage people to debate the policy as opposed to the person. 
ucker: The reason this is so controversial is that there isn't an ideal scenario where the ideal is defined as keeping everyone equally happy. 
reality is that you cannot restore fairness by lowering testosterone, so therefore you either have to have fairness by exclusion of trans women or you must accept a degree of unfairness through the inclusion of trans women. 
Sports will have to make that difficult decision. 
Unfortunately, sports leaders will have to say: do they want inclusion of trans women or do they want to protect the women's category and therefore by necessity have to exclude trans women?
I can't see a compromise solution. It has to be a choice and I think some sports have leaned that way. 
Harper: The world has, over the last few hundred years, moved towards being more inclusive of minorities, whether that's people of colour, LGBT people... In many ways we've come to understand that human beings share more than we differ.
So trying to be accommodating of the differences that humans have is a valuable process and one that I hope will continue.
One of the things is that many people don't actually know any trans people, so this idea that trans women are men who think they're women, that isn't true. The gender identity that trans people have is such an essential part of our being that there is no way to separate that out.
rans people are who we say we are. I am a woman who was born with different physiology than other women, and so my place, I believe, should be with other women.
mething that an inclusive society would recognise. I do admit that when it comes to sports, things are a little more complicated.
What I would suggest is that it is impossible to maximise inclusion, maximise fairness, maximise safety in sport, all three of those, without some impact on the other.
If we maximise inclusion, it does come at some cost to fairness and safety. But I think that we can come up with solutions which, while they may not maximise any one of these three parameters, comes pretty close to maximising all three, and that none of these three important parameters - inclusion, safety and fairness - are overly impacted.
Equality Act 2010 lists gender reassignment as a characteristic given legal protection from discrimination - however, there are exemptions when it comes to sport.
Section 195 of the Act, which deals with sport, says it is lawful to restrict the participation of transgender people from sporting competitions where physical strength, stamina or physique are important factors in deciding who wins, but the restriction can only be done to ensure the competition is fair or the other competitors are safe.
Dr Seema Patel is a senior lecturer in law at Nottingham Law School. She has a PhD in discrimination in sport, looking at the regulatory balance between inclusion and exclusion in competitive sport. She has almost 20 years' expertise on the specific topic of transgender athletes and the law, and argues that the discussion around transgender participation needs to look beyond science and medicine.
In contrast to Harper and Tucker's criticism of the IOC's current guidance, Patel backs the new framework as ""groundbreaking"", saying: ""It's the first time an international governing body has sought to ensure that everyone can participate in sport irrespective of their gender identity or sex variations over the history of eligibility rules for gender diverse athletes. 
""We have never had guidance that focuses on principles of inclusion - no presumption of advantage, dignity and respect for athletes.
""The focus on human rights is necessary to ensure a balance; it shouldn't be one or the other. The science should not be the turning factor on this. It has to be also a matter of law, regulation, sociology, athletes and human rights ultimately, because these athletes are individuals.""
Addressing the Equality Act exemption clause, Patel called it ""highly problematic"" to base an argument on it for transgender exclusion, and suggested the government ""would need to look at amendments to future legislation"".
However, Tucker said: ""People hear discrimination and they automatically think of it as bad and unnecessary and unwanted, but in actual fact, it can be important and it's justifiable in certain instances. 
""The UK Equality Act makes quite clear that you can exclude on the basis of sex where sex is important for safety."""	/sport/61346517

sports	Houston Astros make baseball history with no-hitter	"Houston Astros have made history by completing baseball's first ever combined no-hitter in the sport's showcase event, the World Series. 
's pitchers prevented the Philadelphia Phillies from hitting a single base in the nine-innings clash. 
Houston ran out 5-0 winners to draw level in the seven-game series.
Star pitcher Cristian Javier also made history, becoming just the second player to pitch for six or more innings without conceding a hit.
A combined no-hitter occurs when more than one pitcher prevents the opposition from making a hit. The sport has seen 18 in Major League Baseball history, but it had never happened in the league's franchise event. 
Javier was joined in the achievement by relief pitchers Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero and Ryan Pressly. 
But it was the 25-year-old Dominican's fastball, which can reach speeds of up to 93mph (149km/h), which flummoxed the host side and stunned fans at the Citizens Bank Park. 
Astros catcher Christian Vazquez hailed Javier's performance and said the star had ""best fastball I've ever seen"". 
""You can call it whoever is in the batter's box and it's going to be awesome. It's going to be effective and it's going to do the job.""
Javier joins former New York Yankees pitcher Don Larsen - who threw a perfect game in game 5 of the 1956 World Series at Yankee Stadium - as the only pitchers in the World Series 118-year history to finish an outing conceding no hits.
He also becomes the first player to start in multiple combined no-hitters, re-enacting the key role he played against the New York Yankees in June. 
Javier, who has only surrendered one run since 8 September, is one of the sport's most underappreciated stars. He was signed as an undrafted free agent from the Dominican Republic in 2015. 
""It hasn't sunk in yet,"" Houston manager Dusty Baker said of Javier after the game. ""The sky is the limit for that young man.""
Phillies, who had been unbeaten at home this post-season, are fighting for their first World Series title since 2008. 
But the Astros - who are appearing for the fourth time in six seasons - are seeking redemption after their 2017 win was tainted by revelations of illegal sign-stealing. They were accused of using a video camera in the centre field to film opposition team's hand signals regarding the next pitch.

Dominant left-hander Valdez struck out nine batters and kept the Phillies scoreless until the seventh inning.
Astros raced into an early 3-0 lead in first inning, and Alex Bregman's two-run homer in the fifth put them 5-0 up at Minute Maid Park in Houston.
Late rallies could only produce two isolated runs for the visitors.
ries now moves to Philadelphia, with game three on Monday evening.
A crucial moment came at 5-1 in the eighth when Kyle Schwarber thought he had hit a two-run homer off reliever Rafael Montero, but a video review showed the ball sailing just the wrong side of the right-field foul pole.
And the home fans were relieved when Phillies slugger Bryce Harper flew out to end that inning, stranding two baserunners.
Earlier, the Astros went 2-0 up within four pitches of the first inning as Jose Altuve, Jeremy Pena and Yordan Alvarez took starter Zack Wheeler for doubles, before Alvarez scored on a throwing error.
Phillies did not manage a hit until the third inning, and Bregman went deep to gave Houston a 5-0 lead for the second successive night.
During the regular season Valdez broke the MLB record for consecutive ""quality starts"", where the starter throws at least six innings, giving up no more than three earned runs.
Dominican Republic leftie recorded another, earning a standing ovation as he left in the seventh inning, when he did allow one run as Jean Segura's sacrifice fly drove in Nick Castellanos.

sports	Finn Russell: 'Scotland fly-half's Bath switch must deliver silverware'	"When Finn Russell joined Racing 92 in 2018, he immediately sky-rocketed up rugby's rich list. A reported salary of £850,000 gave him a place among the monied elite of the game.
Now that the worst kept secret in rugby is out and his move to Bath next season has been officially announced, Russell moves further up that pecking order. 
He now goes from probably the joint fourth-best paid rugby player in the world - along with Toulon's Cheslin Kolbe - to the third-best (if we accept the £950,000 a year figure as gospel), or possibly even joint-first along with Bristol's Charles Piutau (if, as reported elsewhere, the figure is actually a million a year).
Money, or lack of it, has been a big issue in the Premiership this season following the debacles at Worcester and Wasps, but among those wealthier outfits there's still the capacity to break the bank for a marquee player. With his incredible skill-set, Russell is box office from top to toe.
It's been quite a time for Russell. Left out of the Scotland squad for the autumn in the latest round of difficulties with his international coach, Gregor Townsend, only to return and put in the kind of stellar performances that made Townsend look utterly daft for effectively calling him the fourth-best fly-half in Scotland. 
me a father for the first time. Then he signed one of the biggest playing contracts ever written in the history of the sport. 
Russell has money, but what he doesn't have is lots of winners' medals. In his entire career - and he's 30 now - he has won one major trophy, the 2015 PRO12. The move to Racing was supposed to address that, but it hasn't. It's provided some fantastic moments, individual and collective, but Racing have failed in Russell's time there. 
For such a talented squad, put together at vast expense, a losing final in the Champions Cup in 2020 is the closest they've come to winning a big title in Russell's time. They're well in the hunt in the Top14 this season but their European prospects are in mortal peril having already lost two out of two.
Russell will feel financially fulfilled, but if elite sport is about more than money then one trophy, more than seven years ago, is a dismal return on his talent. 
You could put together a mesmeric highlights reel of the wondrous things he does on a rugby field, we can wax lyrical about him being a gloriously imaginative outlier in a game now dominated by muscle, but the bottom line is that he has only one piece of silver to show for it.  
What are the chances of him improving on that when he moves to Bath? Financially, it's a no-brainer for him. Rugby-wise, the jury is out. 
Bath are one of England's greatest clubs with a European Cup win in their cabinet, a big support, plans to redevelop their home ground and an incredible legacy of attacking rugby. The Bath we see nowadays is not at the races. 
Last season they finished 13th and last. They've failed to make the top four in six of the last seven seasons and haven't won a Premiership title since 1996. Currently they're eighth of 11 in the Premiership with three wins from nine as well as two defeats from two in Europe. They rank 10th of 11 for points scored and 11th of 11 for tries. 
No wonder they want Russell's ingenuity. The club has stagnated for the longest time. But what can the Scot do about it? That's the intriguing question. 
Bath's coach is the South African Johann van Graan, who moved to The Rec at the beginning of this season after five years as head coach at Munster. Van Graan is a good man, unfailingly polite and a fine technical coach. He's also risk-averse. He's been schooled in the culture of Bokball, 10-man rugby, bludgeon over rapier.
He had some good results with Munster but the rugby was largely dull - or ""turgid nonsense"" as former Munster player Keith Wood called it in Van Graan's last season in Ireland. ""There's no point talking about Munster's attack, it doesn't exist,"" said Wood.
ruckloads of former Munster players criticised Van Graan in his years with the province. One of them said his style belonged to the ""dark ages… it's like 25 years ago."" That's an exaggeration but it spoke to the general air of frustration, the lack of excitement. 
Even the most measured observers of his reign would say that he was okay and nothing more, that they didn't really go anywhere under his coaching. 
rly signs at Bath aren't wholly encouraging either, which makes the Russell signing so fascinating. Part of the reason why the fly-half has had such a testy relationship with Townsend is because of what he sees as a prescriptive gameplan, a lack of freedom to play it as Russell sees it.
's why he's played so well at Racing. He was given licence to play. It might not have resulted in trophies, but he's thrilled the locals for years. 
Unless Van Graan's changes the way he views the game - from conservatism to a style more in keeping with one of the most creative players on the planet - you have to wonder how this is going to end up. 
If he doesn't allow Russell to be Russell, then what's the point in bringing him in? Do you get a cat and ask it to bark? Do you get a brilliantly instinctive player and ask him to play a game of percentages? 
For the sake of Russell's rugby - if not his bank balance - you hope that he's talked all of this through with Van Graan. It's about money for sure, but it also has to be about ambition and getting in the hunt for the biggest trophies. 
You'd like to see Russell operating at the top end of the English game rather than scuffling around near the bottom, where Bath currently reside. Whatever happens, it'll be compelling. "	/sport/rugby-union/64043070
sports	Beijing Winter Olympics boycott: Why are the Games so controversial?	"Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics are taking place over the coming weeks.
China's human rights record has led some countries to declare diplomatic boycotts of the Games, which means their top officials won't attend. 
Winter Olympics take place from 4 February to 20 February, with about 3,000 athletes competing in 109 different events.
Winter Paralympics run from 4 March to 13 March, with about 750 competitors across 78 events.
China's government and businesses are spending $3.9bn (£2.95bn) on the Games, which are taking place in and around Beijing:
About 1.2 million cubic metres of artificial snow is being used because so little falls in the region. China has been criticised over the environmental impact. 
Because of Covid, competitors and officials are in secure ""bubbles"" and no spectator tickets have been sold to the public.
US, UK and Canada declared a diplomatic boycott, along with India, Australia, Lithuania, Kosovo, Belgium, Denmark and Estonia.
, but no ministers or officials are attending.
US said this was because of China's ""human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang"" - against the province's Muslim population.
British MP Iain Duncan Smith, who represents the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said: ""The Chinese government commits industrial-scale human rights abuses in the Uyghur Region, Tibet and sends near-daily military incursions into Taiwan's airspace. 
""We cannot lend any legitimacy to China's despotic regime.""
India declared a diplomatic boycott because one of the torchbearers was a Chinese army officer involved in a deadly skirmish with its troops on the border between the two countries. 
Japan has also said it isn't sending ministers to the Games, but it is sending Olympic officials. 
New Zealand, Austria, Slovenia, Sweden and the Netherlands are not sending government representatives, but say Covid is their reason.
France has been against a boycott. President Macron has said: ""I don't think we should politicise these topics, especially if it is to take steps that are insignificant and symbolic."" 
re have also been protests across the world against the Beijing Games by human rights activists.
Beijing government is accused of committing atrocities against the Uyghur Muslim population in the northwest province of Xinjiang. 
Human rights groups believe more than one million Uyghurs have been detained over the past few years in a large network of what the state calls ""re-education camps"", with hundreds of thousands sentenced to prison terms.
re is evidence that Uyghurs are being used as forced labour, and women are being forcibly sterilised. Some former camp detainees allege they were tortured and sexually abused.
Beijing is also accused of restricting the freedom of people in Hong Kong through new legislation including the Hong Kong National Security Law.
In its 2021 annual report, Human Rights Watch said that ""Beijing's repression - insisting on political loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party - deepened across the country"".
China has consistently denied violating human rights in Xinjiang, and has warned its most vocal accusers - such as the US and Germany - not to interfere in its ""internal affairs"" in Hong Kong.
It has spoken out most loudly against the US diplomatic boycott. 
China's Foreign Ministry said that the US had ""clearly violated the Olympic spirit"", and ""will pay a price for its erroneous actions"". However, it has not specified what this price might be.
Athletes and others attending the Games are being warned about security weaknesses in the app they have to use for daily Covid monitoring.
Cybersecurity group Citizen Lab said the app has weak encryption systems and that data loaded on it such as medical and travel histories could be exploited by hackers. 
Several countries have reportedly told athletes to leave their main devices at home and use burner phones at the Games.

While recurve archery is contested in the Olympics, compound archery - which uses a much shorter bow - is not, although it is in the Paralympics.
World Archery submitted a proposal in July for the sport to be included in the Los Angeles Games.
""I'm hopeful that it happens,"" Gibson told BBC Points West. 
""It's actually for indoor archery, which is a little bit different. At the moment at the Paralympics it's outdoors when they shoot - at 50m for compound or 70m for recurve. The bid has been for 18m for compound [indoors].

Support from family has been invaluable so much so Gibson's parents - who run an ice cream shop in Cirencester - have converted a room into an indoor training hall for her to practice shooting ahead of the upcoming indoor season.

Peaty, 27, was in second place before being passed by Martinenghi on the final 25m length as he claimed Britain's first medal of the event.
""I'm disappointed but I'm not going to allow myself to be,"" he said. ""It is what it is. I am what I am.""
Peaty is a former world record holder in the short course 100m but has never won the world title. He holds the world record of 56.88 seconds for the long course 100m, set in 2019.
""I'm looking forward to a long course season after this week and I've got to be uncomfortable - I've got to be challenged - if I'm going to challenge that world record,"" Peaty said.
""This is the fight I need and I just feel pure anger, which is when I feel very dangerous.""

sports	Tokyo Olympics: Sky Brown eyes surfing at Paris 2024 after skateboarding bronze	"After making history by becoming Great Britain's youngest Olympic medal winner of all time, skateboarder Sky Brown is already plotting her next move - in surfing.
13-year-old claimed bronze in the inaugural women's park final in Tokyo, and immediately raised the prospect of competing in two sports at Paris 2024.
Brown told BBC Sport: That's the goal, that's my dream, competing for skating and surfing in Paris. That would be really cool. I surf more than I skate!""
Her father, Stu, revealed he dissuaded his daughter from trying to compete in surfing as well as skateboarding in Tokyo, but admits he may be powerless to stop her again.
""It'll be up to her by then. She'll be 16, and it's hard enough now,"" he joked.
Sky goes surfing most days before school and has competed at junior levels, finishing second in an aerial surfing invitational in Texas.
re could be one issue making it challenging for Sky to realise her ambition - the surfing is due to be held in Tahiti, nearly 10,000 miles from the French capital where the skateboarding will take place.
Having never had a skateboarding coach, Sky learns most of her tricks from watching YouTube videos, and her natural sporting talent appears to transfer to the water.
Sky, who splits her time between the United States and Japan, often takes advantage of the Californian climate and surfs with her dad, and brother Ocean.
When asked whether it was possible to compete in both events in 2024, she said: ""Maybe. I really hope so - I'm definitely going to try [to compete in] surfing.
""I'm going to go surf a lot after here. I'm excited to see my brother again.""
But that's for 2024. For now, Sky says she is living a ""dream"" after skateboarding success at Tokyo 2020. It's been quite the journey.
Warning: external video from Sky's Instagram account contains footage some viewers may find distressing.
If the Games were held in 2020, it's highly unlikely Sky would have been fit to compete in Tokyo.
Stu said his daughter was ""lucky to be alive"" after crashing last May between two ramps while attempting a jump in training, fracturing her skull, breaking her left arm and wrist, and suffering lacerations to her heart and lungs.
Her parents wanted her to stop skating but she said: ""This will not stop me. I am going for gold in Tokyo 2021.""
In June a video was posted on her Instagram showing the moment she lost control at the top of a ramp. It cut away before the fall to a shot of an air ambulance, followed by a message to her followers from her hospital bed, black eye, arm in a cast.
Nothing is normal for this incredibly talented 13-year-old but perhaps this video, which has more than two million views, underlines just how different her life is.
Sky also tumbled before her Olympic qualifier, breaking her arm, but still came first while wearing a protective cast.
She breezed into Wednesday's final in Tokyo, making light work of her heat with the second-highest score.
It was a nervy start as she fell in her first two runs, putting her fourth going into her last effort - which she admitted she wasn't expecting.
""I thought I was gonna get it. I was a little shocked after the first run. Then after the second fall, I was like, 'Am I gonna make it?'
""Sakura [Yosozumi, Japan's gold medal winner] told me: 'You got it, Sky. We know you're gonna make it'. That really made me feel better.""
Words of encouragement from her dad also helped.
""He was like: 'You know, it's just a contest. It doesn't define you.' That made me feel better - it is just a contest and if you fall, that's what it is,"" added Sky.
ger, who celebrated her 13th birthday just 16 days before the opening ceremony in Tokyo, showed incredible composure to get a clean final run and complete the kickflip indy - the trick that wiped her out in her first two attempts - to seal the bronze with a score of 56.47.
Sky, who was born a month before the Beijing Olympics in 2008, speaks incredibly maturely for a teenager. After finishing on the podium said she hoped more young girls would follow in her footsteps.
""I really hope I inspire young girls. I feel like people aren't too young that they can't do it, but if you believe in yourself you can do anything. I believed in myself,"" she said.
""Anyone can do skateboarding. You don't have to be of a certain height or have to be a certain age - you can do it whenever you want. You've just got to skate and go for it."""	/sport/olympics/58084934

sports	NI Sports Personality of the Year: 2022 winner Rhys McClenaghan has taken 'big steps' in Olympic pursuit	"Rhys McClenaghan says he has made ""big steps"" towards achieving his Olympic dream after he capped a memorable year by winning the 2022 BBC NI Sports Personality of the Year.
McClenaghan wins the award after becoming Ireland's first gymnastics world champion in November.
Having already claimed the European and Commonwealth Games titles, the 23-year-old has his sights set on Paris 2024.
""It's certainly the only one missing from my collection,"" said McClenaghan.
""It's always been the goal, but taking these big steps like conquering the Worlds, that's going to be a step in the right direction towards that Olympic gold.
""This year has replenished that confidence that I've always had in myself. The past year or so has been very challenging and my confidence had maybe dropped a little bit, but certainly after this win my confidence is through the roof.""
McClenaghan's world pommel horse title came after he secured a Commonwealth Games silver medal for Northern Ireland in the summer. 
His silver in Birmingham was achieved despite a turbulent build-up in which the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) ruled that he and team-mates Eamon Montgomery and Ewan McAteer could not perform for NI as they compete for Ireland in international competition, before the governing body reversed its decision.
""It was a difficult year but with a fairytale ending for me, becoming world champion,"" added McClenaghan. 
""That's always going to be the highlight of my career, no matter what I do after this. This will always be the first time I've won a world championship. 
""When my feet hit the floor after the dismount, I just felt relief. Relief after years of hard work and hours I've put into the gym. It all paid off in that moment.""
McClenaghan follows Rory McIlroy, Carl Frampton, David Healy, Jonathan Rea and last year's winner Rachel Furness in collecting the annual honour. 
""It's very special,"" he said. 
""It's special to be recognised by my home country. It's an honour to be up against those names who have had such a great year of success, like I've had. 
""To win this award after such great names like Rory McIlroy and Carl Frampton and all of those idols I've seen growing up in sport, it's special to be listed among them now. 
""It's pretty touching. I remember seeing Carl Frampton speaking at an awards evening one time. I said to my mum, 'I want to be just like him'. I'm maybe not a boxer, but I'm certainly on top of the world just like him.""
McClenaghan edged out runner Ciara Mageean, golfer Rory McIlroy and snooker player Mark Allen for the award.
judging panel included Northern Ireland captain Marissa Callaghan, Armagh GAA great Oisin McConville, four-time Paralympic champion Michael McKillop, Ireland hockey legend Shirley McCay and BBC Sport NI's Thomas Kane. 
""It has been a remarkable year of sporting success but Rhys McClenaghan's achievement in becoming Ireland's first ever gymnastics world champion really stood out for the panel,"" said BBC Sport NI executive editor Neil Brittain. 
""Having suffered first exclusion and then disappointment at the Commonwealth Games, Rhys fought back to claim pommel horse gold in Liverpool and in doing so created one of the most memorable moments of 2022."""	/sport/northern-ireland/64058514

Jepchirchir beat world record holder Brigid Kosgei in the closing stages to win in two hours 27 minutes 20 seconds.
American Molly Seidel took bronze after Israel's Lonah Chemtai Salpeter stopped inside the final five kilometres.
Contested in 28C heat, the race was moved from 07:00 to 06:00 local time due to the forecast temperatures.
Stephanie Davis, the 2021 British champion, finished 39th in 2:36:33.
Compatriots Steph Twell - making her third Olympic appearance at a third different distance after entering the 1500m in 2008 and 5,000m in 2016 - placed 68th in 2:53:26, while Jessica Piasecki was 71st in 2:55:39.
Kenyan team boasted three of the five fastest female marathon runners of all time, but world champion Ruth Chepngetich - who defied the heat and humidity of Doha in 2019 to win gold - pulled up after losing touch with the leaders at 30km.
Jepchirchir and Kosgei were joined by Seidel and Salpeter in the lead group with five kilometres remaining, before the Kenyan pair moved clear and Seidel pushed on following European 10,000m champion Salpeter's abrupt withdrawal to win bronze in just her third outing over the distance.
Kosgei, a two-time London marathon winner who broke Britain's Paula Radcliffe's 16-year-old world record with a time of 2:14:04 at the Chicago Marathon in October 2019, finished 16 seconds behind Jepchirchir and 10 seconds ahead of Seidel.

sports	Kamila Valieva: Anger and sympathy as 15-year-old breaks down at Winter Olympics	"In the end it became one of the most uncomfortable, unpleasant moments of sport in recent memory.
After a week of outrage following a failed drugs test, 15-year-old Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva left the ice in tears as her controversial Olympics came to a distressing conclusion.
""It should never have happened,"" said former Olympic champion Robin Cousins, who himself was overcome by emotion during his commentary.
Elsewhere, there was anger and sympathy as Valieva's Games came to an end...
Valieva came into the Beijing Games as the biggest star in a highly-rated Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) squad.
m grew louder when, in the opening days of competition, she became the first woman to land a quadruple jump at an Olympic Games, doing so in the team event.
But soon after that jump helped ROC claim gold, the story began to change.
medal ceremony was unusually delayed and it was later revealed Valieva had failed a drugs test in December. 
She had tested positive for trimetazidine, used in the prevention of angina attacks but on the banned list because it has been proven to improve physical efficiency.
But Valieva was allowed to compete in the individual event - first in Tuesday's short programme and then the Thursday free skate - because a court ruling lifted her provisional ban following a series of appeals and re-appeals.
Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) pointed to ""exceptional circumstances"" regarding her age and the timing of the test result, which came during the Games and nearly six weeks after the sample was taken.
It said it would do Valieva ""irreparable harm"" if she were not allowed to compete.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) said there would not be a medal ceremony if the Russian finished on the podium. The full doping investigation is yet to follow, meaning Valieva's score could still be removed.
So to Thursday and the climax of the competition.
As the leader after the short programme, in which she stumbled but comfortably led the standings, Valieva was the last to skate - a score of 255.95 by her team-mate Anna Shcherbakova the one to beat.
But Valieva faltered early on in her routine and, with the eyes of the world on her, tumbled to the ice after one of a number of errors, the crowd gasping in disbelief.
""This is difficult to watch,"" said BBC commentator Katherine Downes.
""After her second error it was like she was going around as quick as she could,"" former Olympic champion Jayne Torvill said afterwards. 
""It was like she just wanted to get it over with and get off the ice.""
When her routine did end the teenager was soon in tears and she sobbed while waiting for her scores. She finished fourth, outside the medal places.
Cousins, Great Britain's 1980 figure skating Olympic champion, was also emotional while analysing the action.
""Someone thought having her do that was better than having her go home to her family and to wait and sort this out, knowing she could have two more Olympics ahead of her,"" he said, while pausing to settle his own emotions.
""I am slightly speechless for all the wrong reasons.
""The talent and the unquestionable quality of Valieva - to see it put into this arena in that way, it should never have happened.""
BBC Sport's Sonia Oxley at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing
You almost wanted to look away, it felt wrong to be watching.
If you had not followed the story for the past 10 days, you would have just seen a skater - albeit a gold-medal favourite - falling a few times.
But this was a 15-year-old, whose failed drugs test has played out very publicly, and who had already been in tears on the ice once this week.
She had a lot of Russian support in the arena and there were big gasps when she fell for the first time. But as the mistakes racked up and she fell again on the ice, it was more of a sympathetic applause of encouragement that began to ripple.
She did not immediately let her emotions show, only a throw of the hand into the air. But then the tears came and she just sobbed while awaiting the result. The chants from those on their feet of ""well done"" brought her little comfort.
Watching this unfold, you could not help wonder what would be the long-term effect of having gone through all this on the world's biggest stage. Watching this unfold, all you could think was - she's a child.
xt step will be the authorities dealing with the matter of Valieva's failed drugs test in full. 
will determine whether the ROC gold in the team event - and Valieva's fourth-placed finish in the individual event - will stand.
re will also be intense questions posted to the authorities - the IOC, ROC, Cas and the International Skating Union, in particular - about how this situation was allowed to develop to the stage it overshadowed the competition and left a 15-year-old in this position.
World Anti-doping Agency (Wada) has already said it will be investigating the teenager's entourage, including coaches, doctors and other adults surrounding her.
ual gold medal winner, the 17-year-old Shcherbakova is, like Valieva, coached by Russian Eteri Tutberidze.
""We have been marvelling at these youngsters coming up,"" Cousins said. ""We watched them - 12 years old with the quad [quadruple jump].
""How is this happening? We know they teach them really young. 
""There is obviously an issue - how and why? It is not a question of talent. It is how is that talent being nurtured or created?""
Christopher Dean, who won gold for Great Britain alongside Torvill, said the process had been ""farcical"".
""The organisation, the politics surrounding it to get to this point has been a real mess,"" he added.
""And the loser is figure skating, the women's event is suffering from it.""
re will also be further debates given a Russian has tested positive for a banned substance when the country is already banned from international competition because of its doping past.

sports	Leona Maguire: Modest Cavan woman part of Ireland's female sporting wave in 2022	"Leona Maguire was part of the wave of Irish female sporting success in 2022 even though her innate modesty and reserve, means she still appears almost surprised to see her name dropped in alongside the likes of Katie Taylor, Ciara Mageean and the Republic of Ireland women's team that qualified for next year's World Cup.
Ireland has always embraced its sporting heroes and seems to reserve a particular affection for its female stars.
""I don't think you ever really get used to it,"" says Maguire, the 28-year-old of being recognised by the Irish public on the few occasions during the year when she does get home from her exploits on the LGPA Tour.
Maguire's stunning Solheim Cup debut as Europe triumphed in the US 15 months ago raised her profile massively - especially in her home country - and she built on that success by clinching a first LPGA title when winning the Drive On Championship in Florida back in February. 
""Definitely since the Solheim Cup, I get recognised a bit more with people asking for pictures and things like that,"" Maguire told BBC Sport Northern Ireland. 
""Female sport in Ireland is probably as strong as it's ever been and the girls are going to the World Cup. Rachael Blackmore, Katie Taylor…..there are so many Irish female athletes that are doing great things. I'm just fortunate to be part of that.""
But part of it she is, a stunning two years on the globe's fairways has seen her world ranking shoot up from 177th to 11th. 
Her latest rankings jump saw her move up nine places to a career high as the she finished second behind Lydia Ko at the LPGA's season-ending CME Group Tour Championship, with the Irishwoman's tournament highlighted by a nine-under-par 63 on day three.
rformance brought up Maguire's 2022 LPGA earnings to over $1.8m [£1.45m], which left her ninth in this year's cash standings.
Cavan woman was rated the world's top amateur for a record 135 weeks between 2015 and 2018,  but she insists ""rankings are something I've never really dwelled on"".
Further probed as to whether the number one spot in the paid ranks is a future target, she plays down the notion with a laugh.
""A lot of things would have to go right,"" said Maguire. ""The LPGA is probably as strong as it's ever been. 
""In any given week, there are 30 or 40 players who can turn up and win the tournament. Nelly [Korda] is playing some incredible golf. Lydia is too, Atthaya Thitikul, Jin Young Ko….there are so many great players in the world.""
As for the possibility of emulating the achievements of Irishmen Rory McIlroy, Padraig Harrington, Shane Lowry, Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowell and Fred Daly in winning a major, Maguire isn't making any bold predictions as 2023 approaches.
But she has shown an aptitude for the game's biggest events over the past two seasons with a final-round 61 helping her share sixth at the Evian Championship last year, in addition to being tied fourth at this year's Women's Open at Muirfield and also achieving a top-10 finish at the US Women's Open two months earlier.
""We've got a busy summer next year with four majors in the space of seven weeks plus a Solheim Cup, so I will try to get the game in as good a shape as possible for that stretch and we'll see what happens."" she added.
Maguire admits she has picked the brains of Harrington, Lowry and winning 2014 Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley in terms of how they prepared for the sport's biggest events.
""They've been a tremendous help to me in giving me advice and answering my questions,"" she said.
""Having my caddie Dermot [Byrne] on my bag is lucky for me as well as he was with Shane for eight or nine years so I have plenty of experience to lean on,"" adds Maguire, who says she will ""hopefully"" tee up at both the World Invitational at Galgorm and the Irish Women's Open at Dromoland Castle in 2023 as she did this year.
Like with all world-class sports people, Maguire talks about her ""team"", which includes the Niall Horan-founded Modest Golf management group, but family has always been central to her golf career and remains so.
Maguire and identical twin Lisa emerged as golf prodigies when they were not even in their teens although Lisa is now studying dentistry at University College Cork after ending her own professional career in 2019.
""Mam and Dad [Breda and Declan] have been a huge part of that journey as has been Lisa and my brother Odhran too,"" said Maguire.
""With her studies, Lisa's pretty busy but she's still working part-time with my management company. 
""She travelled all summer with me and caddied in a couple of events when Dermot have some other commitments. ""
""It was nice to have her on the bag for a few weeks and she's always there to lend a helping hand whenever it's needed,"" she added.
""We're very fortunate to have had each other. I never would have gotten to where I've gotten to without Lisa.""
When the Maguire twins competed as 12-year-olds in the Ladies European Tour's Northern Ireland Open in 2007, they were no Irish role models in women's professional golf.
However with Stephanie Meadow also on the LPGA Tour and Olivia Mehaffey making her way in the paid ranks, it's a different picture 15 years on.
""You don't really think about the role model thing day to day. I just do what I do. Work hard and try and be the best version of me as possible,"" she said.
""If people are inspired by that, that's fantastic and hopefully we'll have a few more Irish girls out on the LPGA over the next few years."""	/sport/golf/63975630

""We're just good mates - there's nothing else to it,"" Scott says. ""It's a question we get asked a lot and we're both just like: 'Yeah we're just mates - should we be more than that? Are you guys wanting it to be something else?'""
Scott's wit is as sharp as his performances have been in the last 12 months.
A 200m freestyle silver was one of four Olympic medals secured in Tokyo, a British record for one Games. He swam a personal best in every final, but came away without an individual gold.
His determination to change that in 2024 is clear - not that he cares much about the adulation or profile that comes with glory.
""I've got my own goals and expectations and whether people rate me or don't rate me, I couldn't care less,"" Scott says.
""There's a little bit of publicity around the Olympics and it's great the Commonwealth Games is keeping the media attention in the sport but it's so different compared with if I was a footballer. 
""The day in, day out. If they perform badly it's all over the papers and so on. But for me I quite like just shutting it all out to be honest. I couldn't care less what everyone's writing about me - or not.""
While happy to just get on with the job, it is possible to detect Scott's frustration at the lack of recognition in the UK for elite swimmers.
He believes meet organisers need to cut ticket prices to attract more fans and, though he and other swimmers were recognised in the Queen's New Year Honours List with an MBE, he was left astonished at one omission.
""I just don't understand why [Adam] Peaty's not been knighted,"" he says, bemused. ""I don't know who decides it. But for me as a sports fan and a swimmer and comparing him to other people who have been knighted... that's shocking.
""Back-to-back Olympian, unbeaten in Olympic cycles, he's won everything he could win, world-record holder. Sixteen European golds. Look at the other people who have been knighted. I don't know, unbelievable.""
Disappointingly Scott, who starts his Games on Saturday, had to withdraw from June's World Championships - his primary focus of the year - after a slow recovery from a bout of Covid-19.
As a result he has barely raced since April, and so it's hard for him to gauge his form.
""I really struggled initially,"" he says, ""I was like: 'Why am I not getting any better?' But weeks go by and it just clicks. It was just getting used to the fact I can't speed this up. It's going to happen of its own accord.
""I'm all good now. I'm looking forward to it and I don't think it's going to be too much of a hindrance.""
Now, Birmingham is the focus. It was the Commonwealth Games four years ago when he announced himself by becoming the first Scot to win six medals in one Games - including a sensational gold in the 100m freestyle.
Scott feels it will be difficult to match that given the competitiveness of the relays in particular, and he has not raced in the 100m free much recently, the event in which he stunned home favourite and then Olympic champion Kyle Chalmers on the Gold Coast.
""I'm really good friends with Kyle and I've been giving him a little bit of stick about how I'm the defending champion,"" Scott laughs. ""But his PB is almost a second quicker than mine now so I'm sure I'll be kept quiet there...
""The last time, most medals ever at a single Games... I didn't know it was a thing. Same with the Olympics; I didn't know that [most medals by a British athlete] was a thing until after the relay. 
""I wouldn't say that's a lack of knowledge because it's probably just not something I'd ever searched at. It's just in my sport that's not something you particularly aim for or try to achieve. 
""I don't know what the overall number is for most in Team Scotland. But that's not something I'll be thinking about. I've got individual goals that I want to try to achieve."""	/sport/commonwealth-games/61758529
sports	Sophie Luff on Christmas in Australia, grade cricket and being an overseas pro	"""It's hot and there's Christmas trees and all these decorations going up, it feels a bit weird.""
West country stalwart Sophie Luff is not spending this festive period in Lympsham, Somerset. Instead, she is more than 10,000 miles away in Parramatta, Sydney experiencing her first winter in Australia.
A self-confessed ""home bird"", Luff has made quite the name for herself as one of the most recognisable and reliable cricketers on the domestic circuit.
29-year-old has scored in excess of 5,000 List A and Twenty20 runs, with most of those coming for Somerset and Western Storm in England.
But as the women's game becomes increasingly professionalised, the opportunity to spend time in new environments abroad becomes both an attractive and available option for many players.
""It was never anything I really considered,"" Luff confesses.
""I feel like I've had two really good winters since coming into the professional world where I've had a shift in my game, developed a lot more options and taken my game to a different level which I've had to do because the game is developing very quickly.
""But now I'm a full-time professional, it's my job to play cricket all year round so for me this is a step to challenge myself in a different environment and in a different role.""
Settling into Sydney life, Luff has already banked her first century for Parramatta District cricket club in grade cricket. She scored an unbeaten 101* in a win that saw Parramatta leapfrog Sydney to top spot.
""There's a bit of pressure on me being an overseas pro,"" says Luff. ""I know my record speaks for itself, but no-one knows me out here.
""One of the girls said she was Googling me before I came over and she saw I was holding a cricket bat so she just presumed I must be OK, which made me laugh.""
While playing in different conditions is the obvious difference and advantage of spending time overseas, Luff says the real benefit is facing different players. 
""At home, women's cricket is such a small pool, everyone knows everyone,"" says Luff. ""It's like you've almost already played the game before you've turned up because you know exactly what bowlers you're going to face.
""Whereas here, I don't really know anyone or what they're going to bowl, who fields where, whether they've got a good arm.
""I'm having to adapt during the game ball by ball, on the spot. It's been refreshing to have to strip things down and play each ball on its merit and find a plan there and then.""
Luff is also training with New South Wales Breakers alongside The Blaze's Kirstie Gordon.
""I didn't know we were both going to be here at the same time so that's been a nice surprise to have another Pom out here,"" she adds.
""I've always played against Kirstie and now we're in training together and we're helping each other which is weird, because when we go back to England, we're going to be playing against each other again. But it's all about everyone developing and trying to get as good as they can be.
""We're still getting elite training at a very good level - the cricket centre in New South Wales is unbelievable, it's ridiculous. There are 18 indoor lanes, there's going to be 40 turf wickets out the back, they've got a pitch out the front, gym, recovery pools, you name it they've got it. It's a different world.""
Luff recognises there is a growing opportunity for an exchange programme to strengthen players in Australia and England. 
""I came over here as an older, more experienced player who hasn't done this sort of thing before but for some of our younger regional players I see it as an opportunity for them to get life experience,"" says Luff.
""It's more well-rounded than just the cricket that they'd be here for. 
""But there's an element of trust needed with that. If teams are going to send young professionals across the world for five or six months there's got to be a good relationship.
""I'd like to think there could be relationships built between the state teams out here and the regional domestic teams at home.
""It would be great if there was something set up where some of the NSW Breaker girls could come and compete in our domestic competition which would obviously increase the standard of that. I could see it being a two-way thing moving forwards.""
And outside of cricket? 
""I could easily get used to the lifestyle here,"" laughs Luff.
""My day is usually planned out and then depending on what I've got on the question is where I can get a coffee in and where are we going to go. Kirstie [Gordon] has a list of different places she wants to hit up, so I think I'm being roped into a few of those."""	/sport/cricket/63854207

sports	Kelly Catlin: A family's search for answers on links between concussion and suicide	"In January 2019, on a sunny day in the coastal mountains surrounding San Francisco, an Olympic medal-winning cyclist was racing down a twisting ribbon of tarmac, descending at the kind of blistering speed reserved for cars and motorbikes.
On a surface that had dried quickly after the first rainfall for weeks, Kelly Catlin suddenly lost control.
Her bike flew out from underneath her and tumbled down the hillside, coming to a stop in a cloud of dust. She was carried forward and skidded across the road, tumbling several times. 
Catlin knew the drill of the hardened cyclist: jump up, survey the bike, examine the burning road rash and torn Lycra, get back up and finish the ride.
She seemed OK. She headed home. Later she spoke with her mum on the phone.
""She was telling me about it and kind of laughing,"" Catlin's mother Carolyn Emory told BBC World Service. 
""I asked her: 'Did you check your helmet?' 'No it's fine,' she said. But then she did check and it had dents on the front and back.""
Catlin didn't realise at the time, but she had suffered a concussion. Soon after, she began to experience painful and confusing symptoms. Her mood and behaviour changed, she became anxious and depressed. Her family was worried - she no longer seemed herself. 
wo months later, Catlin had taken her own life. She was 23. 
Looking for answers has been a long, painful and complex journey for her family. 
But they believe doing so will help raise awareness about an issue that sport - and especially cycling - has for too long ignored.
One of triplets, Catlin was a gifted athlete growing up. She seemed destined to achieve in almost any sport she liked. She was an especially talented football player, but when injuries saw her take up cycling as a way of keeping fit on the sidelines, there was no going back.
""It was like she was born with this drive or obsessiveness. Not to be an Olympic athlete necessarily, but to excel or to be good at something,"" says her father Mark.
""Anything she focused on, she really focused. Art, Chinese… With school assignments she would do it and go beyond. Cycling was the thing it got channelled into.""
By the time of her crash, Catlin was a postgraduate computer science student at Stanford University in California, a three-time world track cycling champion in the team pursuit and an Olympics silver medallist with the United States. 
She was out that day as part of her training with professional team Rally Cycling, one of America's best. She had no idea how seriously her injuries would go on to affect her.
Weeks afterwards, she was still in constant pain and discomfort. Doctors' diagnoses could not pinpoint exactly what was wrong.
""She went to Germany for a World Cup thing, but she couldn't do it because she had severe headaches,"" says Carolyn. ""She stayed an extra week after the team left because she couldn't cope with the airport lights and the noise."" 
Mark adds: ""She went to the Olympic Training Centre (OTC) and had a whole bunch of scans which didn't show up an awful lot.
""Then things went downhill. They put her on some therapy for dizziness, light sensitivity and headaches. She had eye exercises. They trained her with all sorts of monitors and oxygen and blood pressure - all that stuff. Something was definitely wrong.""
Catlin attempted suicide at the end of January 2019, but did not succeed. 
""Part of her brain knew it was too much after the first attempt,"" says Carolyn. ""She gave us her word she would not try again. 
""But she talked to her sister on the phone a couple of days before she killed herself and said she was still thinking about it. She referred to: 'If things don't change in a month…' 
""It was almost a goodbye."" 
Mark adds: ""She gave us her word, but in fact I think she just said that to get out of hospital. The staff realised it wasn't the right thing to do to let her go, but she was going to get a lawyer - she was determined to get out.""
Soon after Catlin's phone call with her sister, and following a campus wellness check initiated by Carolyn after a series of unanswered phone calls, Catlin was found dead in her apartment at Stanford in March 2019. 
Her father Mark believes his daughter would still be alive had her symptoms, which included depression and anxiety, been recognised as evidence of post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Catlin had suffered several concussions - the crash was not her first - but the link was not made.
If it had been, Mark believes, Catlin would have followed guidance to take several weeks' full rest, after which time, in many cases, PCS symptoms ease and patients recover. However, continuing to combine her cycling and studies, Catlin had been as busy as ever; determined to achieve, restless and intense in her pursuit of excellence, just like she always was.
Catlin's family believe the symptoms she was experiencing, combined with this complex edge to her personality, proved too much for her; a woman whose drive for perfection was focused on fulfilling potential.
According to the Washington Post,external-link her diaries later revealed she lived by a set of guidelines which included ""I do not cry"". 
We often see elite sport as the pinnacle of human performance. With it comes a perception that an athlete cannot be too dedicated in their pursuit of glory, that practice makes perfect. We think of their resilience or stoicism in the same way. A 'we go again' philosophy many champions possess.
Catlin referred to this herself in a blog post for the website VeloNews, published in late February 2019, shortly before her death.
She wrote: ""As athletes, we are all socially programmed to be stoic with our pain, to bear our burdens and not complain, even when such stoicism reaches the point of stupidity and those burdens begin to damage us. These are hard habits to break.
""The truth is that most of the time, I don't make everything work. It's like juggling with knives, but I really am dropping a lot of them. It's just that most of them hit the floor and not me.""
Brain injury remains poorly understood in the sporting world. Only in recent years has awareness begun to grow around the degenerative condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and its links with repeated blows to the head, and/or concussion. 
UK charity Headway has played a major role in developing interventions to mitigate against risks facing athletes, while also campaigning for wider understanding of post-concussion syndrome, too. 
Because while CTE tends to develop later in life, with symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease and can currently only be fully diagnosed post-mortem, PCS is experienced in the immediate weeks or months after a concussion. 
A key phrase from Headway's campaign work is: 'If in doubt, sit it out.' The reality of the cycling world can often be found a long way from that message. 
In road cycling, a rider must quickly get back on their bike following a crash to avoid losing touch with the peloton and missing a time limit, causing elimination. 
Last year's men's road cycling season saw some high-profile instances of concussion - one during each of the three Grand Tour races. The most concerning came at the 2020 Tour de France, in which Frenchman Romain Bardet crashed on stage 13. 
He was contesting the lead of the race, but after crashing was clearly disorientated when he was lifted on to his feet, and his legs gave way and he collapsed. Within a minute he was back on his bike. He finished the 192km stage before it was revealed he not only had concussion, but had suffered a brain haemorrhage. 
Several of Catlin's USA Cycling counterparts have highlighted their concerns over concussions they suffered during their careers on the track, including 2020 world time trial champion Chloe Dygert and US time trial champion Carmen Small, who says her career was eventually ended by it. 
""All athletes want to keep pushing when they should probably stop,"" Small has said. ""I still have headaches. I was never diagnosed, but I remember being out of it for four days in a dark room and having vertigo for six weeks.""
Since Catlin's death, USA Cycling has launched a wellbeing programme and ""multiple strategic initiatives aimed at changing the narrative around mental health"".
re are some other early signs of progress. 
On Friday, the UK government published new plans to develop protocolsexternal-link around concussion in sport, following a July report from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. 
Cycling's governing body the UCI has introduced new measures to better ensure the safety of athletes following head injuries. Team members will be trained to recognise the signs of concussion, record every incident centrally and follow a set time limit for recovery and returning to competition.  
And during this year's Paris-Nice, Britain's 2020 Giro d'Italia champion Tao Geoghegan Hart was pulled out of the race after his team Ineos Grenadiers opted for caution - a move which was widely praised.
Following Catlin's death, her parents donated her brain to the Concussion Legacy Foundation Brain Bank at Boston University to aid further research into the effects of concussion. 
In a statement released at the same time, her father Mark identified four areas of possible cause: Personality, stress, overtraining and concussion. 
Mark says: ""Kelly was such a complex individual and very private - one who kept a lot of feelings inside and kept a veneer of: 'I'm an iron woman.' 
""She wouldn't reveal her emotional or psychical situation, probably to anybody. She kept pushing herself when she shouldn't have been. It all had a cumulative effect on her, a very strong woman brought down by that combination.
""It's like part of us is torn out. I wake up every morning with a sense of disbelief she's gone. Every night I wake up and play over and over in my head: 'If only I'd done this…'
Carolyn adds: ""We don't want any other athletes to go through this. Short of getting Kelly back, we just want to get the right programme to help folk before it's too late.
""I just wish she was still here.""

first sprint will be at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in Baku on 28-30 April, which will be either the third or fourth race of the season depending on whether F1 replaces the cancelled Chinese Grand Prix.

sports	Sunny Edwards v Felix Alvarado: IBF flyweight champion on legacy, fearing fame and Daniel Kinahan	"Sunny Edwards is the IBF flyweight world champion. He is undefeated in 18 fights and regarded as one of, if not the most, talented fighters in the UK.
But he does not share the profile of some of his domestic peers like Tyson Fury. 5 Live boxing analyst Steve Bunce this week described him as the ""forgotten man of boxing"".
""Some people think I'm a star in the making and other people say nobody cares about me,"" Edwards says.
26-year-old defends his title for the third time on Friday evening at the 13,000-seater Sheffield Utilita Arena against Nicaraguan Felix Alvarado, a former world champion at light-flyweight. 
His last two fights have been in Dubai away from the direct gaze of a British boxing audience.
re is a long-held belief in boxing that flyweights simply do not attract the same attention as the heavier weights. There may be some truth to it, since it is no coincidence Anthony Joshua and Fury are both heavyweights and command most of the boxing fanfare in the UK.
Edwards admits he is hardly a knockout artist, with his last seven fights having gone the distance. 
He does believe, however, that he has never been in a close fight as a professional and is eager to face the best in the division and unify the belts. 
He signed to fight Mexico's WBC champion Julio Cesar Martinez earlier this year, but it fell through.
""I don't really care to be famous,"" he says.
""I'm not an AJ or a Chris Eubank that have profiles outside of boxing. I can only imagine what that does to them, not even wanting to leave the house. 
""What used to be pleasant when you're the champ is taken away when you lose - you're a bum now. I can't imagine what it does in the long run to people.""
Edwards' decisions outside the ring can often distract from his talents inside it. He has a constant presence on social media and has even posted his GSCE and A-Level results on Twitter to prove a point to a fan who questioned his intelligence.
Croydon fighter thinks he has ""at least a mild case of ADHD"" but is wary of seeking an official diagnosis. The rise of TikTok and the movement of mental health has helped him understand his ""scatter brain"" more in recent months. 
But he admits he has made mistakes. He says he will probably continue to make mistakes. 
""I'm a humble, 26 year-old boxer who doesn't know as much about the world as I think I do on Twitter,"" he says.
One of those mistakes might be his association with Daniel Kinahan. The Irishman was sanctioned by US authorities in April, accused of being a key figure of a global organised crime group.
Kinahan was allowed to operate freely in boxing as an advisor, setting up a promotional and management company MTK Global in Spain, which underwent a rebranding in 2017 in an attempt to publicly distance themselves from its co-founder. 
Edwards was signed to MTK and one of several fighters to publicly back Kinahan ""as a legitimate business"" last year before cutting all ties.
""Loyalty"" he says is part of what drove him to defend a then under-fire Kinahan. Edwards says building a core team you can rely on is the most difficult thing in a sport with little oversight from a global authority.
He asks why boxers have been lambasted for their relationships with Kinahan when broadcasters and promoters were happy to do deals with him.
""I did have a relationship with Daniel, but at the time he was working in boxing. Every promoter was working with him, making fights. That's facts,"" he says.
""I met a lot of promoters in and around having him involved. He's no longer in boxing and now it's about focusing on the future. 
""It is one of those sensitive topics and a hard spot to really answer from because you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.""
MTK went under in the wake of the sanctions against Kinahan. Edwards was not the only fighter signed to the company. Fury, Savannah Marshall, Josh Taylor and Billy Joe Saunders were all associated with MTK at times in their careers. 
Boxing's credibility has been under siege. The reality of Kinahan's involvement in the sport was quickly followed by Conor Benn's drug scandal. 
Edwards believes more ""transparency and accountability"" is needed, but believes unless it is applied ""top to bottom"" the problems will never go away.
He also suggested boxers perhaps need more impartial support, even a union, to help them navigate a landscape that is ""stacked against"" them.
""The boxers are the smallest cog. It's a thankless job we're doing,"" he insists. ""There are fighters who have lost their lives earning £800, £600 on the night. 
""You have every conversation. When every single promoter in world boxing was willing to make phone calls, meetings with [Kinahan] then why is it up to the boxers to do more? I don't get it. 
""There is right and wrong, but why are the smallest cogs the baddest people when promoters were the ones making the conversation?""
""It's a terrible lonely sport and you're playing against the house,"" he adds.
For Edwards, he wants to move forward. His current promotional company has spent much of the year defending itself against accusations it was tied to Kinahan in some capacity.
Promoter Richard Schaefer has denied any links, is also looking forward and granted Edwards' wish to have a ""homecoming"" in Sheffield. 
Edwards lives and trains in Sheffield and has three fighters he manages on the undercard, something he is very proud of. 
He hopes to keep ""surprising"" people, in a good way, and prove himself a fighter willing to step in the ring with anyone. He is unsure if the fanfare will follow.
Fame does not appeal to him. He is now making enough money to support his two kids after being paid £1000 for his pro debut in 2016.
He is acutely aware a loss on Friday could see his ""whole world come crashing down"". But he embraces the challenge. 
""I don't care if anyone outside of boxing fans know who I am because I know what I do in the ring will leave a legacy to the right people. I know it will,"" he says.
""I'm here to be competitive and I want to be in competitive fights. 
""To challenge all the biggest names in the division, win, lose or draw, so at the end of my career people will say Sunny fought anyone."""	/sport/boxing/63557459

sports	Savannah Bananas: Meet the man behind the 'world-famous baseball circus'	"Having won the World Series, the Houston Astros can justifiably call themselves the best baseball team on the planet.
But if it's unabashed fun you want, the choreographed, breakdancing, kilt-wearing, sometimes stilt-wearing exhibition team that bill themselves as the ""world-famous baseball circus"" take some beating.
""Every night we do 5-10 things we've never done before, so you never know what's gonna happen,"" says Bananas owner Jesse Cole.
Part baseball team, part viral sensation, the Bananas have accumulated more than 82 million likes on TikTok and play at a permanently sold-out stadium.
And with on-field haircuts, team twerks and High School Musical recreations among some of the stunts they pull off, the Bananas aren't just about the baseball.
But what are they all about - and where did it all begin?
Well, the Bananas were founded in 2016 in Savannah, Georgia with the motto 'fans first, entertain always'. They have since taken baseball by storm, and landed their own ESPN docu-series.
BBC Sport caught up with Cole after his side had won the Coastal Plain League Championship seriesexternal-link - a summer league for college players - for the second successive year.
Cole, 38, is a baseball fanatic. In 2014 - while working as general manager of the Gastonia Grizzlies - he proposed to his now wife Emily in front of a sold-out crowd at a match in North Carolina.
following day, Emily planned a trip to Savannah, where the couple visited Grayson Stadium - then home of the Savannah Sand Gnats.
""We saw this beautiful old ballpark, fell in love with that stadium, and heard that team was leaving,"" says Cole, who is usually seen dressed in a yellow tuxedo.
""We said: 'Why don't we give it a shot?' We had a big vision.""
Cole admits it ""didn't come to fruition right away"".
When the couple were given the keys to the stadium in October 2015, everything had been stripped out and they used a storage space as their first office. Their team of staff comprised Emily, a 24-year-old team president, and three 22-year-olds straight out of college.
ub launched itself in the local community a month later, but there was huge scepticism - by the end of the year only one season ticket had been sold.
Coles went all in - selling their house and committing their savings to the project. Jesse admits it was a ""huge struggle"".
""The community were really questioning who we were,"" he says. ""We had a lot of convincing to do.""
run a competition to name the team. More than 1,000 suggestions were sent in and retired nurse Lynn Moses was the only person to put forward 'Bananas'.
Cole says: ""When she said it, we said: 'Wow. We can really have fun with this brand.'""
It was a big turning point. The naming announcementexternal-link in February 2016 went viral.
Having initially sold only a handful of tickets, their opening match against Lexington County in June 2016external-link became a complete sell-out, with just over 4,000 people present. Those lucky enough to secure tickets were not disappointed.
""They saw our Banana Nanas senior citizen dance team, dancing players, our breakdancing coach and banana pep band, and they saw all the fun that we put into it,"" says Cole.
Six years on, the club have a waiting list of requests for single-game tickets of about 75,000.
Cole says the aim is to leave fans asking: 'Did they really just do that on a baseball field?'
""In some sports, there are barriers between the players and the fans and we break down those barriers,"" he says.
""A lot of these fans, especially kids, look up to players, and how often do you really get to know them and get to interact? That's a really big goal of what we do.""
Cole and his team have also reinvented baseball - creating a spin-off version called 'Banana Ball' which has various rule changes, including a two-hour time limit. The intention, Cole says, is for it to be ""more entertaining"".
""I wasn't a fan of the way baseball was,"" he says.
""Everything is about the speed and the excitement. So I think the goal was: 'If you don't like baseball, I think you'll love our shows.'""
ws will now tour the country, with the club recently announcing they will depart the league set-up to play Banana Ball all year round.external-link
But with so much going on aside from the actual baseball, what does it take to be a Savannah Bananas player?
""You've got to be very talented at baseball and you've got to understand how to be an entertainer,"" says Cole. 
""If you're just good at baseball, but don't understand how to be 'fans first' and how to put on a show, you won't fit in well.
""It's a combination of talent and the ability to be an entertainer.""
It's a mix that has helped the Bananas reach hundreds of millions of views across their social media platforms.
""I never would have imagined dancing pitchers would have done so well,"" admits Cole.
And he says the same as he reflects on the team getting a series on ESPN, adding two words that neatly sum up the journey he and the team have been on.
""It's wild."""	/sport/baseball/62617290

sports	New Year Honours: Pat Jennings 'absolutely delighted' with CBE	"Former Northern Ireland goalkeeper Pat Jennings says he is ""absolutely delighted"" after being made a CBE in the New Year Honours list.
Jennings won five trophies with Tottenham and Arsenal and earned 119 caps for Northern Ireland. 
""It's lovely to be recognised,"" said the 77-year-old.
Former Northern Ireland captain Gail Redmond and NI lawn and indoor bowler Sandra Bailie have become MBEs for services to football and bowls.
Jennings has been recognised for his services to football and charity. His haul of 119 caps was a record for the Northern Ireland men's team until he was surpassed by current captain Steven Davis in October 2020. 
He won his first cap in 1964 at the age of 18 in a British Home Championship match against Wales alongside fellow debutant George Best.
Newry-born goalkeeper also played for Northern Ireland at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups, making the final appearance of his 22-year international career in a 3-0 defeat by Brazil at the latter tournament in Mexico. 
He was in goal for Northern Ireland's memorable win over hosts Spain at the 1982 finals. 
""I've been very lucky with getting my MBE on the Queen's Birthday Honours list way back in 1976,"" Jennings added.
""Especially when you get to my age, you appreciate it more.""
Jennings is involved with cross-community charity work and in grassroots football with the Irish FA. He says his work in football reminds him of when he started out playing the sport.
""It brings it right back to me. Those sorts of people in grassroots football nowadays, they are the people who set me up way back 65 years ago.
""I love going around the country acknowledging the work those people do.
""My weeks wouldn't be the same if I wasn't involved with those charities. They are all great causes so it is great to be able to do something to support them.""
In 1963 Jennings moved to England, leaving Newry Town to join Watford, who were in the Third Division, before moving to Tottenham Hotspur a year later.
Jennings played 591 games in 13 years at White Hart Lane, winning his first FA Cup in 1967.
He went on to score in the Charity Shield victory over Manchester United later that year, and won the UEFA Cup and two League Cups with Spurs while he was also named the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year in 1976.
A year later, he joined Tottenham's north London rivals Arsenal, where he featured in three successive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980, winning in 1979. 
After retiring in 1986, Jennings became Tottenham's goalkeeping coach and he remains on the staff at the Premier League club. 
Former Northern Ireland women's captain Redmond has also been recognised with a MBE for services to women's football.
Redmond, who won 25 Northern Ireland caps, started her playing career as a teenager with the Post Office before she spent 10 years in America as a player and head soccer coach with the University of Southern Mississippi.
She returned to Northern Ireland and Glentoran in 2008, where she won four league titles and numerous cups before retiring in 2016, and she now volunteers as a coach with the east Belfast club.
Redmond started working for the Irish FA in 2009 and is currently the women's development manager at the Irish FA Foundation.
""I feel so humbled, to tell you the truth, I just see it as doing my job,"" she told BBC Sport about her work with women's football.
""I don't think it will sink in for a while, or maybe until I actually receive it.
""You look at the list on 1 January every year and see who is on it, and now my name will be there.""
Bailie has been made a MBE for her services to lawn bowls. 
62-year-old, from Comber in County Down, holds the record for the most Irish indoor titles (29) and has won British titles in triples and pairs competitions.
She has also excelled in outdoor bowls, with seven Irish titles.
""I like to win, I am very competitive, but I am also one of the best losers you will ever come across,"" she said.
""I have tried to give something back to the game too.""

sports	Modern pentathlon: GB's Joe Choong threatens to quit if obstacle racing replaces show jumping	"Britain's Olympic champion Joe Choong says he will quit modern pentathlon if show jumping is replaced with obstacle course racing as one of the events.
Modern pentathlon is currently made up of fencing, swimming, show jumping and a combined running and shooting event.
Show jumping was removed by the sport's international governing body, the UIPM, after a German coach was seen striking a horse at the Tokyo Olympics.
UIPM then proposed to replace the discipline with obstacle racing.
National federations will vote on whether to replace show jumping on Saturday, with support from at least two-thirds of them needed to make the switch.
""If the fifth discipline of obstacles goes through and the leadership stays the same, I will walk away from the sport,"" Choong told the BBC.
""I don't believe the leadership is capable and it's not an acceptable way to manage a sport.""
Choong, 27, won gold for Team GB in Tokyo last year, while compatriot Kate French won the women's title.
Show jumping will remain one of the five events for the 2024 Olympics in Paris, but modern pentathlon is not currently listed to be included in the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.
Obstacle course racing was selected from 61 suggestions to replace show jumping during a consultation in October 2021. Climbing, javelin, long jump, orienteering and cyclo-cross were also considered.
Obstacle course racing has been tested in four countries throughout this year, with organisers saying there was an 88% satisfaction rating from participants.
It is the only sport that has been tested as an alternative to show jumping, which the UIPM said is because of time constraints.
UIPM president Dr Klaus Schormann said last month that modern pentathlon needs to become more accessible.
""We are looking for the future, we are proud about the past, but never forget: change or you will be changed,"" he said.
""That is our vision, Los Angeles 2028, Brisbane 2032 and ongoing Olympic Games, I'm very much convinced that we have to change.""
Alex Watson, a modern pentathlete who competed at three Olympic Games for Australia, has put himself forward to replace Schormann as president.
""The sport is in chaos and it can't continue, the responsibility lies clearly with the UIPM leadership,"" he said.
Athletes from USA Pentathlon have also opposed the proposed changes."	/sport/modern-pentathlon/63586206

Earlier, compatriot Chris Murray also won gold in the men's 81kg.
Davies lifted 103kg in the snatch round, a new Commonwealth Games record, and needed just one 126kg lift in the clean and jerk round to win gold, after Eze failed all three of her attempts at 125kg.
Davies missed her first attempt and needed a few minutes to compose herself before confidently shooting the bar above her head on her second go, to finish on 229kg.

He doesn't have an agent. He doesn't do social media or email. His address is not his own. He doesn't even own a phone. 
It's the way he likes it now. The way it has to be.
find Manyonga takes a speculative call to a distant contact. He passes on another number, who, in turn, forwards on a text message. 
, a day or two later, an unknown number hums in reply. As the connection is made, Manyonga's familiar grin spreads across the screen.
Sitting in a plain bedroom, Manyonga runs a hand across his head. It used to be shaved to a shine. 
""I've grown some hair now!"" he laughs as he examines his new close crop in the corner of the borrowed phone.
More than just his hair style has changed for Manyonga though.
Back in 2017, he was doing another BBC Sport interview.
High among the London Stadium's girders and rafters, sat between Denise Lewis and Michael Johnson, Manyonga told a prime-time audience of his redemption.
He had been an addict, hooked on 'tik'. 
It is a form of crystal meth, that has seeped through South Africa's townships. Cut with other substances, it is sold in 'straws', before being heated, often in a stolen car headlight bulb, and smoked.
Manyonga had escaped the street-corner deals and hazy squats though. His life was long jump now, he said. 
revious evening, his long limbs had levered him through the night sky and landed world gold. He celebrated by falling back into the pit and flapping his limbs, leaving the imprint of an angel and an impression on the globe.
""I was a kid, I went through that and I overcame it,"" he told presenter Gabby Logan back then of his substance abuse.
It was a happy ending that was spread around the world. 
But, addiction isn't so neat. Its mess will not be contained by a storyline, however satisfying.
Manyonga's great strength had kept addiction at bay. But the converse was also true. Tik only needed a glimmer of weakness to regain its hold.
""After I lost my mother things went south for me, you understand?"" said Manyonga as he recalled his past two years.
""I didn't mourn my mother, I took it so lightly, and, in hindsight, I was using drugs to supress it, to not feel the pain. 
""I was using on a daily basis. I just wanted to numb myself to the point of not knowing what date it was.""
Joyce, Manyonga's mother, died in 2020. She had raised Manyonga as well as his brother and sister on her own in a small, four-room house on Machule Street, a sparse, dusty road in the midst of Mbekweni township, north of Paarl. 
Working as a cleaner, she carefully sliced up and shared out the 120 rand (£6) she earned each week. Most times, she still managed to find the five rand (25p) for Manyonga's ticket to Stellenbosch, where he trained.
Joyce's death hit Luvo hard. So hard, in fact, that his own nearly followed.
""I could easily have lost my life,"" he said of his relapse. ""I was doing all kinds of crazy things.
""I don't like to mention them all… some of those things junkies do like stealing, car jacking, house breaking.
""I was like a thug in a way because of how I lost myself into drugs.
""I am glad God was with me and I am glad I am still alive.""
In his altered state, Manyonga always believed he would return to the top of the world. The Tik-induced euphoria told him he would. More dangerously, his past experience said the same. 
He had kicked the drug before, then taken gold. One report even claimsexternal-link Manyonga, lured into an untimely binge, went to rehabilitation just a month before London 2017.
""There was a mentality that came to me when I was high on my substances that said 'you're great, you've done it before and come back with a bang',"" he said.
""I thought I could take drugs again and go and perform, but I was lying to myself. That's the truth, it was the drugs talking to my brain.
""Kids would come up when I was walking on the street with my head out - high on drugs - and ask me 'Luvo when are we going to see you on TV?'
""Comments like that made me realise I was missing the point. These kids seeing me, a world champion in the state of a junkie... a nobody.""
While his demons whispered to Manyonga that his comeback could coincide with sport's return from lockdown, the drugs testers were circling.
After Manyonga missed a doping test in November 2019, his chaotic existence meant he failed to give his whereabouts for testers' visits in April and October 2020.
ree missed tests triggered a ban. A previous 18-month suspension back in 2012 for methamphetamine use counted against him. In total, Manyonga was banned for four years. He will only be able to compete again in December 2024.
Manyonga could, perhaps should, be bitter.
He harmed himself, rather than his rivals. His drug use is an illness, exacerbated by poverty, rather than a cynical get-faster-quick plot. 
At London 2017, on the same night Manyonga won his gold, Justin Gatlin took the 100m title. 
Gatlin has been banned for less time than Manyonga, despite the American twice testing positive for pharmaceutical performance-enhancers.
""I understand my ban. It was fair as a wake-up call to all those who depend on others,"" Manyonga said. 
""Athletics is a personal sport, an individual sport. You have to look after your things.""
In the meantime, until his ban expires, Manyonga will sit, wait and take responsibility.
His mind slips back occasionally to London. He watched Manchester City play at West Ham United on television back in August. While most eyes were on Erling Haaland, his were drawn to the London Stadium's sidelines.
""I pointed to where the long jump pit, the runway is. It stills feels like yesterday that I was there,"" he said.
""Back then people were having so much fun, now long jump is so quiet
""There is still a chance for Luvo to come back and bring up the game.""
wo years away. By then, Manyonga will be 33.
At the moment, his time-frames are shorter. Living in the north-west of South Africa, away from his pushers and his past, he is a few weeks clean, taking one day at a time.
""Things have been tough, I won't lie,"" he said.
""But I am a strong guy. This is my reality and I cannot escape it, you understand?
""The only thing I have to do now is find Luvo. Not the world champion, not the junkie, Luvo.
""If I can find that person, things will be in place.""
Manyonga is a hard man to find. Even for himself."	/sport/athletics/63170714
sports	Emma Raducanu prepares to defend US Open title after Fairytale of New York	"Going into the summer of 2021, few outside British tennis circles had heard of Emma Raducanu. By the end of the US Open in September, she was a national superstar and known around the globe.
A version of this article was originally published in December 2021
Winning the Grand Slam title as an 18-year-old qualifier was a staggering achievement, one that had never been done before at any of tennis' four majors.
As she prepares to return to Flushing Meadows as the defending champion next week, we revisit the triumph that transformed the Bromley teenager from a 499-1 pre-tournament outsider to the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. 
Featuring interviews with British tennis legends Virginia Wade and Tim Henman, plus members of Raducanu's backroom team, this is a taste of a BBC Radio 5 Live Sport documentary's insight into one of the greatest achievements and most incredible stories in the history of sport. 
A couple of months before last year's US Open, Raducanu was launched into the consciousness of the British public with a scintillating run at Wimbledon.
Having been given a wildcard to her home Grand Slam, she reached the last 16 before breathing problems forced her to retire against Ajla Tomljanovic in what was then the biggest match of her career.
Wimbledon was her second professional tournament and to reach the US Open main draw in only her fourth, the world number 150 would have to win three qualifying matches in New York.
Henman, the former British men's number one, is close friends with Andrew Richardson, the coach who helped guide Raducanu to the US Open title.
""If you had said to Emma and Andrew before qualifying 'would you sign a document to guarantee winning three qualifying matches but lose in the first round of the main draw?' I think there is a fair chance both would have signed on the dotted line,"" said Henman.
w is supported by Will Herbert, the physio who Raducanu called 'The Mechanic' for keeping her fit during the US Open.
""My memory of seeing Emma for the first time in New York is that her body was toast. She was exhausted,"" Herbert recalled.
""She had some pretty successful weeks in Chicago so her body was a bit of a mess. Our initial aim was to get her through 'qualies'. That's where we felt she was. 
""The mobility in her back had gone and muscles were fatigued. Our aim was to try and restore normal movement.""
Despite those concerns, there were signs from the day she touched down in New York that Raducanu meant business.
Iain Bates, the LTA's head of women's tennis, remembers her being ""kicked off"" her practice court after her allotted hour had expired and Raducanu being determined to find another court so she could practise ""five or 10 minutes more of finishing forehands"".
""Even at the start of that week, she was right on it,"" said Bates.
So it proved as, in heat that topped 35C at Flushing Meadows, she backed up her Wimbledon exploits with three assured wins to earn her place in a first overseas Grand Slam main draw.
Like most fairytales, Raducanu's story includes a twist of fate that altered the course of her journey.
American 13th seed Jennifer Brady - who reached the Australian Open final earlier in the year - was supposed to be the Briton's first-round opponent.
But she withdrew because of a knee injury, so Raducanu faced 128th-ranked Stefanie Vogele instead.
Raducanu was a break down in each set against the experienced Swiss, but won 6-2 6-3 with her seventh match point after a slight wobble.
Next up was China's Zhang Shuai, a 32-year-old ranked 101 places higher and with more than 500 career match wins.
Raducanu delivered another impressive display that belied her youth and inexperience, sweeping Zhang aside with a confident and aggressive performance.
Henman had watched Raducanu's qualifying matches back home before flying out to cover the main draw in his role as a television commentator.
""One element that struck me immediately was the level of her play,"" said the six-time Grand Slam semi-finalist.
""The conditions were quite quick, the ball was lively, but the way she was hitting and moving, dictating play, was very impressive from someone ranked 150th in the world.""
reline alone did not fully illustrate her superiority - but it did in her next match against Spain's Sara Sorribes Tormo.
rmo had recently beaten world number one Ashleigh Barty at the Olympics but had no answer to Raducanu's power and precision in a 6-0 6-1 thrashing.
""It was one of the big moments of the tournament for Emma,"" said Henman. 
""It was that detail and focus of attention to the strategy of Emma playing how she wanted, hitting spots on serve and being really aggressive from the back of the court.
""That's when you knew the level of play was incredibly high. At that stage, for me, the question was: 'Can she sustain it?'""
uzz around Raducanu had started to build. 
She had been a popular attraction in the first week, and fans now packed around the smaller outdoor courts to catch a glimpse of her playing, then waited around for selfies and autographs.
With a beaming smile, Raducanu fulfilled every request and her enjoyment on and off court was clear to see.
re was, however, a steely determination for the experience to continue.
xt obstacle was facing the last remaining American woman in the draw in Arthur Ashe Stadium - and Raducanu recovered from a slow start to see off Shelby Rogers.
Herbert said: ""After every match Andrew would turn to me and say: 'What's happening, Will? What's going on?' I would reply: 'I have no idea.'""
In the quarter-finals Raducanu met Swiss 11th seed Belinda Bencic, who was fresh from winning the Olympic title and a considerable step up in pedigree from her previous opponents.
""The first time I thought Emma could win the title was after she beat Bencic,"" said Bates.
Raducanu again oozed composed execution and clarity of thought in another straight-set win.
following day, she did the same against Greek 17th seed Maria Sakkari.
Not only did Raducanu have no day off between the matches, she also dealt with the new and potentially overwhelming experience of playing under the lights on a rowdy Ashe.
""Emma was managing to impose herself and force her opponents to make mistakes. Those wins were really special. It was an absolute joy to watch,"" said Wade.
Almost three weeks after she had arrived in New York, Raducanu was preparing to play in the final against another teenager, Canada's Leylah Fernandez.
Herbert says there was little sign of nerves from the Briton in the build-up.
""You never know how people react to a first Grand Slam final. Some people crumble and some people embrace it. She was taking it in her stride.""
re-match knock-up on Ashe was less assured, according to Henman.
""It was one of the worst warm-ups I've seen in a long time,"" he laughed. ""But when the umpire called time and they started going, the level of both players from point one was exceptional.""
As she had all tournament, Raducanu trusted her game in the showdown. Even when two championship points were missed, she maintained her belief and composure to seal a stunning triumph nobody had predicted.
""The level she was able to build day after day just took everybody's breath away,"" said Bates.
""But the poise she played with, the class she showed, and the enormity of the achievement, we all take a step back now and look back with enormous pride.""
Wade was among the first to greet Raducanu as she came off court. 
""We found our way down to the players' lounge - I had to be the first in line to hug her,"" said the 1977 Wimbledon champion.
""It was one big buzz. Everyone was so excited. It was the hug line.""
Herbert, Richardson and Henman celebrated with beers, champagne and a platter of cheese.
Once the new champion had completed her media duties and been fitted for her victory dress, the entourage left Flushing Meadows at 11:30pm. The celebrations continued until about 5am in their hotel, accompanied by plenty of sushi and more champagne.
""Every now and then I think about it and just have a little chuckle. It was so surreal,"" reflected Herbert.
""It unfolded just beautifully. That's the only way I can describe it."""	/sport/tennis/62581621

sports	Winter Olympics: Where might China's medals come from at Beijing 2022?	"Jeff Pain had no doubt about his brief when he became China's skeleton coach seven years ago: ""We're hiring you because we want to win a gold medal,"" he was told.
When you consider the Beijing 2022 hosts had at the time never competed at an Olympics in this sport, the statement was more than a little ambitious.
But now, a week before the Games start, it may not necessarily be unrealistic. 
While China are not expecting the dizzying successes of their 2008 Beijing summer Olympics, where they topped the medal table with 48 golds and a total of 100 medals, they have once again invested heavily to develop athletes across the full range of sports.
After setting a target of getting 300 million people participating in winter sports in the country, hiring foreign coaches and operating a strong talent identification programme, they have been tipped by analysts to improve on their best showing of 11 medals, including five gold, from Vancouver in 2010.
It seems the Chinese medal machine is about to deliver once again - so, what can we expect and how did they get there? 
Freestyle skier Eileen Gu - or Gu Ailing as the 18-year-old is known in China - is set to be the face of her home Games and with good reason.
She is the world champion in halfpipe and slopestyle and also has a medal chance in big air.
American-born teenager, who began representing China in 2019 after switching to her mother's nationality, has also shown her commercial potential by modelling for high-profile brands and her intelligence with a place at Stanford University.
In their virtual medal table, data analysts Nielsen Gracenote predict she will win two golds and a bronze with China picking up a record 13 medals in total, including six golds.
""The projected medals are all in sports in which the Chinese have previously won medals - figure skating, freestyle skiing, short track, snowboard and speed skating,"" said Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at Nielsen Gracenote.  
Wu Dajing will seek to defend his men's 500m short-track title, while Ren Ziwei has won World Cup golds in the 1,000m and 1,500m and the relay teams are tipped to do well.
Short-track has provided 10 of the 13 Winter Olympic gold medals China have ever won.
Figure skating pair Sui Wenjing and Han Cong will be hoping to go one better than their 2018 silver, and speed skaters Ning Zhongyan and Gao Tingyu could be medal contenders. 
A lack of international competitions during the coronavirus pandemic has made it harder to gauge form generally, but China are strong in the aerials, having won eight medals in the past three Games in the discipline. They have excellent chances of success again, including in the new mixed team aerials.
In snowboarding they have Liu Jiayu, whose 2018 halfpipe silver was China's first medal in any Olympic snowboard discipline, and two-time halfpipe world champion Cai Xuetong.
And there could also be some surprises in some of their new sports, with many pointing to the sliding track.
""Their athletes will have let's say 400 runs, where everybody else will have 45. So there is a huge home field advantage,"" Canadian former skeleton athlete Pain, who coached the Chinese team from 2015 to 2019, told BBC Sport.
Geng Wenqiang, who won a World Cup gold in November, had been expected to be selected in the men's skeleton team but China instead chose Yin Zheng and Yan Wengang. Neither of the women they have picked have finished higher than 15th in a senior international event.
For some time China has been bringing in foreign coaches to guide their athletes in sports where they are not traditionally strong - their rowing head coach at Tokyo 2020 was British five-time Olympic champion Sir Steve Redgrave and they won three rowing medals at the same Games for the first time.
When Pain arrived as skeleton coach, he had to manage expectations and get the Chinese to understand ""how difficult first it is to get there and then to succeed"" at a Games in this sport.
He also faced challenges with the budget - almost limitless in some ways but restrictive in others because ""the need to buy something today has to be planned almost a year in advance"".
Pain left his post in 2019 because he did not want to live in China full-time, but even though he is now coaching the Austrian team, he says he will feel pride watching the team in Beijing as he brought so many of them to the sport and developed them.
""They are sort of like my kids! I raised them in a sense and now they are off into the world,"" he said.
A decade ago when champion gymnast Zhang Shangwu was found begging on the streets of Beijing, performing acrobatic tricks for loose change, the spotlight was shone on the Chinese state sports system.
Children as young as six were being sent away by their parents to sports schools to train as future Olympic champions. Those who succeed can expect to be rewarded with money and status, but there are many stories of those who do not and are abandoned by the state. 
Beijing-based journalist Mark Dreyer said the Zhang situation had prompted some soul-searching and there was ""a government push as well as an organic trend among the middle class to say that sport is healthy but sport for sport's sake"". 
""An enjoyment of sports rather than 'I'm going to sacrifice my kid to be part of the state system',"" he added.
More evidence of a shift in attitude came at last year's Tokyo Olympics, where state media urged the public to be more ""rational"" after silver-medal-winning table tennis athletes faced online abuse from nationalists who view anything less than gold as unpatriotic.  
""There is generally a progression away from the kind of 'win-at-all-costs' mentality - it is trending in a more healthy direction,"" said Dreyer, author of Sporting Superpower and writer for China Sports Insider.
""Intellectually they realise that it's not doing anything for the country to win a bunch of Olympic medals in sports that no-one really competes in, but emotionally it's still hard to accept that maybe we might not win 50 golds like we did in Beijing 2008 and actually that's a good thing.""
m for these Games has been different because since winning the bid in 2015 there was not long enough to bring the really young children through. That means they have turned to older athletes from different sports, like bringing distance runners into cross-country skiing.
Measures of success at these Games may be presented domestically in different ways to simply a medal count, with the country saying it has exceeded its target of getting 300 million people into winter sports and is set to meet or come very close to its aim of having Chinese athletes qualifying for every event.  
""I think it's quite easy for them to hold that up and say this is just one step along the way,"" Dreyer said. ""Any medals is the icing on the cake."""	/sport/winter-olympics/59951494
sports	Ireland: Wing Jacob Stockdale should go to Rugby World Cup 'if back to his best'	"Former Ireland wing Andrew Trimble says Ulster's Jacob Stockdale should be part of Ireland's World Cup squad in the autumn ""if he gets back to his best"".
Stockdale was named player of the tournament after scoring a remarkable seven tries in the 2018 Six Nations tournament and was nominated for European Player of the Year in 2019.
Injuries have limited his appearances for Ireland and Ulster in recent years.
""If he gets anywhere near his best he has to go,"" argued Trimble.
""He's up there with James Lowe for me in terms of Ireland wings,"" the 70-times capped Ireland international told BBC Sport NI's Ulster Rugby Show.
""He played the best rugby you'll ever see a winger play and he'll never get back there but if he gets anywhere near that it's good enough.""
Stockdale has scored 19 tries in 35 Ireland appearances but injury has prevented him from representing his country since his try-scoring last cap against Japan in July 2021.
26-year-old was side-lined for almost a year after sustaining an ankle injury on the opening day of the 2021-22 campaign.
After playing against Connacht and Scarlets at the start of this season, he suffered a further setback with another ankle problem in the defeat by Leinster on 30 September, although he did turn out for Ireland A in their 47-19 defeat by an All Blacks XV on 4 November.
""I thought he looked incredible [in those opening two games] - fired up, hungry, powerful - he looked like he had a proper pre-season and had got himself ready - then the injury came and he hasn't been able to get that momentum,"" added Trimble.
rimble joined regular presenter Tommy Bowe in the final Ulster Rugby Show of 2022 and the pair agreed that Hugo Keenan, Lowe, Mack Hansen and probably Jimmy O'Brien looked 'nailed on' to be part of Andy Farrell's squad for the World Cup.
mong 'the back five' to make the plane to France in the autumn, with Jordan Larmour, Keith Earls, Andrew Conway, Robert Baloucoune, Michael Lowry and Stockdale all in contention.
Bowe believes that while Ireland can take confidence from their recent impressive run of results and their position as world number one they are ""not in the perfect position"" heading into World Cup year.
""I think squad depth isn't maybe in as good a place as we would like it to be,"" said the ex-Ulster wing.
""You look at the Ireland A match against a New Zealand XV and Ireland's match with Fiji, I think a lot of the guys didn't rise up to the level we thought they would have.
""Ireland have eight more matches now before the Rugby World Cup and there are very few of those players who are going to get a chance to break into the squad.
""There are a few guys who had chances but didn't take them.
""We won our three matches in the autumn and proved that where need be we could win ugly but still I think there are areas in the squad that there are question marks over.""
For his part, Trimble believes that among the pluses from the autumn matches was being able to overcome a South African team renowned for its physicality.
""We learned how to cope with that big physical South Africa team, the same could apply to a French or English team, we learned that we can cope with that style of play, also that Stuart McCloskey fits into international rugby and Jack Crowley is a credible option at fly-half if required,"" said Trimble.
wo former Ireland wings acknowledge that the loss of either Johnny Sexton or Tadhg Furlong through injury would be difficult for Ireland to cope with, and the same applies to Leinster loose-head prop Andrew Porter.
""Jeremy Loughman put his hand up in November, he went quite well, but I do think loose-head is a worry,"" observed Trimble.
""We have strength in depth at hooker with Ronan Kelleher, Dan Sheehan, Rob Herring and potentially Tom Stewart as a bolter while you have James Ryan and Iain Henderson probably in the second row and Tadgh Beirne at six, Josh van der Flier at seven and Caelan Doris at eight.""
uo reveal that they think Keenan, Hansen, Robbie Henshaw, Garry Ringrose, Lowe, Sexton and Jamison Gibson-Park represent Ireland's strongest starting XV in the back division.
While McCloskey, Herring and Henderson seem the most likely Ulster players to be part of the travelling World Cup squad, Trimble and Bowe consider Stewart, James Hume, Lowry, Nathan Doak, Stockdale, Baloucoune, Stewart and Tom O'Toole to be in the mix also.
""A few of the Ulster guys are not quite where they were last year but if they can get back to where they were last year, or in previous years in Stockdale's case, then they will be in contention,"" added Trimble."	/sport/rugby-union/64119399
sports	Adventurer attempts Antarctic row after heart surgery	"A man is to attempt one of the world's most dangerous rows in the Antarctic in honour of the ""forgotten hero"" of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Endurance voyage - just months after open heart surgery.
Jamie Douglas-Hamilton will row from Elephant Island to South Georgia.
grandson of the 14th Duke of Hamilton will brave the Scotia Sea - the roughest and coldest on Earth.
He is also calling for the Polar Medal to be awarded posthumously to Harry McNish, the carpenter on Endurance.
McNish was on Shackleton's ill-fated voyage, which ended with the expedition vessel being sunk by pack ice in October 1915.
group managed to reach Elephant Island and McNish, from Port Glasgow, adapted the James Caird lifeboat to make it seaworthy for the voyage. Some of the crew made it to South Georgia to seek help.
Mr Douglas-Hamilton, 41, from Edinburgh, will be the only Britain in a team of six hoping to row the 950-mile route sailed by the James Caird, which has never been attempted before in a rowing boat.
urer, who is a seven times Guinness World record holder, told BBC Scotland he had read the unpublished diaries of Harry McNish after befriending his great nephew, John McNish.
He said: ""I've read all of his personal diary and it is a myth that Shackleton was the greatest leader of all time. The truth is quite different.
""None of the crew would have made it back if it was not for Harry McNish.
""Not only did he build the boat that saved the whole crew with the most limited of tools, but he created the sledges and the crampons using nails from the boat for Shackleton to cross the mountains of South Georgia to the whaling station on the other side.
""Without McNish speaking up to Shackleton on the pack ice, the lifeboat hulls would have been irreparably damaged. He was portrayed as a mutineer but was the real hero.""
McNish was denied the Polar Medal.
Mr Douglas-Hamilton said he died destitute in New Zealand, unable to use his hands due to frostbite from the trip.
John McNish, said, ""Our family are incredibly touched that Jamie is rowing the treacherous seas of the Antarctic which my great uncle sailed in the early 1900s and that the journey will be made in honour of him.
""Our family is incredibly proud of my great uncle, and we have always believed it to be very unjust that Chippy wasn't given the Polar Medal.
""It is very exciting that this expedition, The Harry McNish Row, will highlight just how brave and courageous my great uncle was.""
rip was originally planned for December 2021 but had to be postponed as Mr Douglas-Hamilton discovered he had a heart condition that he believes would have killed him on the journey.
""I was born with a bicuspid aortic valve where you've only got two valves going to the aorta not three,"" he said.
He went to the hospital for scans after drifting in and out of consciousness during a cycling race in May and was told he needed immediate open heart surgery.
""I couldn't believe it, I went in there trying to get antibiotics and then had to go through this process, my heart was double the size,"" he said.
""It had been leaking for 20 years.""
Surgeons replaced the aorta and valve using metal, fabric and a bovine cusp.
It is only in the last week that he has been able to train at full capacity since having the operation in August, which left him unable to even pick up a kettle for the first six weeks.
By the time he leaves for the challenge on 10 January he will only have had five months to recover.
But Mr Douglas-Hamilton told BBC Scotland he was not scared to take on the row, which he is undergoing to raise money for the British Heart Foundation.
He said: ""The best thing to do with these things is to throw yourself into the situation and then there is no way of getting out so you have to carry on.
""While you are on the boat you don't have very much time to daydream as you are fighting for every second.
""It's afterwards you look back and think that was pretty scary.""
Mr Douglas-Hamilton is the only British member of a team of six who will row three at a time in 90-minute shifts around the clock over the course of the journey, which is expected to take two and a half to three weeks.
will be captained by Icelandic explorer, Fiann Paul, who has more than 40 world records.
Mr Douglas-Hamilton knows what is in store for him after completing three other dangerous rowing challenges.
former East Lothian's Belhaven Hill School pupil - who was previously part of a team which rowed from Chile to Antarctica in 2019, said: ""On my last trip a string in my boot rubbed so much it went through to the bone.
""The pain was so bad I couldn't sleep for two days and nights.
""My toes froze and my hands went numb. The carbon fibre boat is in very cold water which you're sitting on and the constant spray and waves mean your are constantly cold and wet with no heaters to dry you.
""The pain you go through is tremendous and I remember feeling in agony.""
Mr Douglas-Hamilton was inspired by his grandfather, Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, to be an adventurer. His grandfather was the first man to fly over Mount Everest in 1933 in an open cockpit plane.
Mr Douglas-Hamilton said: ""I wish I had been born in that time of exploration.
""Most things have been done now although the oceans are the last frontier so that's why I've chosen rowing.""
He added: ""It does get pretty concerning out there when you're being tossed around like you are in a washing machine. The secret is to trick your sub-conscious mind.""
He said his father, James Douglas-Hamilton, a member of the House of Lords as a life peer, and mother were fully supporting him.
He will be leaving the UK on 2 January 2023 from Edinburgh Airport and will meet his crew in Ushuaia, Argentina. "	/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-63944082

Players gathered at Teviotdale Indoor Bowling Arena in Hawick to pay tribute to the four-times world champion.
Ms Forrest, 54, became a member of the club shortly after it opened in 1986, going on to win the club championship 14 times. She has also won four British singles titles.
She said: ""This is surreal - this place has been my second home for so long.""
Julie Forrest Stadium was officially unveiled on Saturday before the eight-times Scottish champion took to the green for friendly matches.
Although she is still at the top of her game - having lifted the World Bowls Indoor Championship trophy again in April - she believes that her best days are numbered.
She explained: ""I want to finish at the top and that will likely be in the next couple of years.
""I don't want to be one of those players that slowly slides down the rankings. One thing is for sure, I will keep playing bowls here at the Julie Forrest Stadium for as long as I can.""
Indoor Bowling Arena's committee hatched the plan to name the centre in honour of its most successful member more than three years ago.
A combination of legislation and the pandemic stalled the renaming until this month.
Councillor Stuart Marshall, who has been on the committee for the past 15 years, said: ""Julie has represented Hawick and Teviotdale bowling on the world stage.
""She has excelled on the world stage and we are ever so proud of her.

Shorten clinched her first world title as the dominant British finished 2.23 seconds ahead of the Netherlands.
GB quartet of Shorten, Heidi Long, Samantha Redgrave and Rowan McKellar took control of the race after halfway.
""We knew everyone was going to bring their game today,"" said Shorten, 28.
""We got off to a good start, our speed was good, and I think we knew we were going to have to work hard in the second half because everyone was going to be with us but we held our cool and we did that really well,"" added Shorten.
""We didn't lose our heads in the middle of the race, and we just kept going.""
With the Netherlands taking silver, the medal places were completed by Olympic champions Australia.
world gold completed a superb first season for the four GB rowers who remained unbeaten throughout and had won the European title last month and they have set down a marker to the rest of the world with less than two years to the Paris Olympics.
Despite trailing to the fast-starting Australians and with the Dutch and China in contention the GB boat, stroked by Shorten, moved to the front by the halfway mark and gradually, but with confidence, rowed away to a winning margin of just over a boat length.
""Each race we knew we had to improve to stay on top of the field. This has been a long year, long season, and next year with the Olympic qualification it will be another huge one. But right now, I am a bit speechless,"" added Shorten.
Irish four, bronze medallists from the Olympics last year, finished in sixth and last place, with the crew of Aifric Keogh, Elmer Lambe, Fiona Murtagh and Emily Hegarty, never in the hunt for the medals.
rest of the world tried to take the race to the Olympic and World champions Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy in the men's lightweight double sculls final.
Irish duo were last at the 500m mark but by halfway had moved through the field to first.
O'Donovan and McCarthy then raised the rate again to move a length clear as they dominated the closing stages to win by clear water from Italy and Ukraine.
It's a third world title for O'Donovan in the lightweight double sculls to go with two more in the lightweight singles sculls.

sports	Africa Super League: Can new competition improve club game on continent?	"Morocco may well have broken barriers for African football with the country's historic run to the World Cup semi-finals, but the club game on the continent is still lagging well behind the standards in Europe.
As such, Confederation of African Football (Caf) president Patrice Motsepe is hoping the launch of the Africa Super League next year will change that.
South African described the new competition as ""one of the most exciting developments in the history of African football"" when he unveiled the latest plans in Tanzania in August.
Flanked by the the boss of world football's governing body, Fifa president Gianni Infantino, Motsepe stressed it was all about pumping more money into club football in Africa, with $100m available as prize money and the winners getting $11.5m.
urnament had been mooted to kick off in August 2023, with plans to involve 24 clubs from 16 countries, although recent reports suggest that there may only be eight teams now. 
However many there are in a format that may well follow the European Champions League, the plan is to culminate in a 'Super Bowl-like' final in May 2024.
Africa Super League will run alongside the existing African Champions League, which features 16 teams in its group stage but has been dominated by North African sides over the past decade.
Caf is promising a huge investment of $200m in total - not only for the participating clubs, but also for the development of the women's game and youth academies in its 54 member countries.
good to be true? Some people think so.
""We've not been consulted once,"" bridles John Comitis, the chairman and owner of Cape Town City FC, which competes in South Africa's Premier Soccer League (PSL).
former striker has been involved in African football for almost 40 years and is not happy about what he calls ""the opaque selection process"" of the clubs for the new Super League.
Comitis says he received a couple of lists of the clubs which would be included, and believes that the chosen ones are ""politically positioned clubs, owned by certain rich individuals or by the state"".
State ownership of football clubs is still quite common across Africa, although that is not the case in South Africa itself.
Comitis' biggest concern is the effect the new continental competition might have on the PSL, which he describes as ""very efficient and professional"" in terms of funding and broadcasting rights.
""The infrastructure nightmare of Africa is unprecedented,"" he says, highlighting how his team travelled to DR Congo for a game and could not get there and back in less than five days and describing the costs of the journey as ""outrageous.""
In this context, Comitis believes it will be almost impossible to fit Super League games into the existing schedule and that national leagues will undoubtedly suffer, potentially losing broadcast money if the top clubs are fielding B-teams in domestic games.
""At the end of the day, we are protecting our businesses and South African football,"" he concludes.
Some may call that sour grapes, as Comitis has clearly indicated that his team was not one of the chosen 24 once earmarked for the Super League.
It is still unclear where the planned $200m prize and development fund will come from, especially after Caf reported a loss of over $40m in its most recent audited accounts., even if Motsepe continually talks of significant interest from the commercial sector. 
A Caf spokesperson said Motsepe, elected as Caf boss in March 2021, ""has the best interests of African football at heart"".
re is, meanwhile, no doubt that mining billionaire Motsepe has invested a lot of his personal fortune into the game as owner of the reigning South African champions Mamelodi Sundowns.
Should they actually happen, the sums involved would make the African Super League more valuable than the Africa Cup of Nations, which has always garnered international attention and culminated in a final which pitted then-Liverpool team-mates and global icons Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah against each other when Senegal beat Egypt in February.
Osasu Obayiuwana, a Nigerian football journalist, believes the concept for the new club competition was not designed in Africa, but was, in fact, the brainchild of Infantino.
""There is a belief outside of Africa that Africans need to be led like babies. I find this highly insulting,"" Obayiuwana said.
Just like Comitis, Obayiuwana is concerned the football calendar will become far too congested.
Should 24 teams take part, the Africa Super League would feature 24 match days over a season - a lot to fit in alongside domestic campaigns spread across around 38 weeks and African Champions League commitments.
Add to that the logistics of extra travel across the continent, which presents a challenge in itself, and the scale of the task is clear. 
""You can imagine the amount of pressure that will be on the players,"" Obayiuwana added.
Caf says details of the Africa Super League are still being ironed out but, amid a lot of criticism and unanswered questions, the new competition does have its big-name supporters. 
South Africa's record goalscorer Benni McCarthy played in Africa and Europe, winning the European Champions League with Jose Mourinho's Porto in 2004, and is now first-team coach at Manchester United after spells managing in his homeland at Cape Town City and AmaZulu.
He thinks the new Super League will provide more earning potential for clubs and a better platform for players which could be transformative.
""I would love to see an African player compete against the best players in the world because it's been too long since we had an African win the Ballon d'Or,"" the 45-year-old said, referencing Liberian George Weah's victory in 1995.
""African football is brilliant but it is not on the same level as European football. The speed and the technical side are different to what players are used to in Africa.
""I think the Super League will remove that barrier by making African football more competitive.""
, but, in reality, if the new Africa Super League is to have a fighting chance of succeeding it will need to attract TV money, which is the lifeblood of football in Europe and helped make England's Premier League the most financially successful league in the world.
But, as Obayiuwana points out, African broadcasters spend more money on the European game than African football - with their argument being that the product is not deserving of their investment. 
So, how do you resolve this chicken and the egg situation? Without TV money and sponsorship, it will be a struggle to develop the quality of the football on show.
Obayiuwana believes Caf should build local leagues first, promote them on the continent and make them into brands.
, just as with the Champions League in Europe, fans will ""get to know the players and clubs and will be invested in them, which is not the case in Africa"".
It starts with people actually being able to watch matches across the continent, which in many countries is a real issue.
""It is easier for me to watch the Europa League in Lagos than to watch a match between Esperance and Raja Casablanca in the African Champions League,"" the Nigerian said. 
Despite the progress by African sides at the World Cup, improving the club game could prove a tougher challenge for Motsepe."	/sport/africa/63637986

25-year-old, at her first senior championship, was second going into Sunday's showjumping finale in Pratoni, Italy, and finished with a clear round for a total of 23.2 on Banzai du Loir.
Germany's Michael Jung, the leader, then hit two fences in his round to hand Ingham victory.
""I really didn't think this would happen,"" she said.
""The horse was impeccable and I am just over the moon. I can't explain how happy I am.""
Ingham, who is based in Cheshire, was competing as an individual and had a superb competition, sitting third after the dressage phase and incurring just 1.2 time faults in Saturday's cross-country to be 4.4 penalties behind Jung, the former Olympic, world and European champion.
""I'm just speechless - I can't believe it,"" she added.
""It was pressurised and nerve-wracking but I just tried to treat it like a normal competition and stick to my routine.""
Ingham follows the likes of fellow GB rider Ros Canter, who took the title in 2018, and Zara Tindall (then Phillips), who triumphed in 2006, as well as Ginny Leng, Lucinda Green and Mary Gordon-Watson.
Canter was part of the GB team in Pratoni along with Tom McEwen, Laura Collett and Oliver Townend, but the defending champions finished out of the medals in fourth as they chased a sixth title.
quartet finished on 100.9, missing out on bronze by 0.2 with Germany taking gold (95.2) ahead of the United States (100.3) and New Zealand (100.7).
However, the GB team have still secured qualification for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
Britain were well in contention but Townend, the world number one had a disappointing end to his round, hitting three of the last four fences.
Canter missed out on a share of individual bronze with New Zealand's Tim Price after the pair both finished on a total of 26.2 but Canter had a slower showjumping time."	/sport/equestrian/62948258

American, a 15-time major winner, is still recovering from severe leg injuries suffered in a car crash in February 2021.
He has also developed plantar fasciitisexternal-link - pain in the base of his foot.
It means the 46-year-old has been limited to only nine rounds of competitive golf this year.
Before taking part in the Match - an exhibition tournament in Florida - last week, Woods had not played since the Open Championship at St Andrews in July, when he missed the cut.
weekend he played in the PNC Championship family golf tournament in Orlando, Florida, alongside son Charlie, 13.
And when asked how he felt compared to when he played in the event last year, Woods said he had made ""a lot"" of progress.
""Last year I played with a broken leg. This year nothing was broken, but it was good that all the pieces are there again all lined up,"" he said.
""Plantar fasciitis is no fun and now I get to truly recover and heal and progress forward on this.
""There are so many good things that I've been able to do physically - be able to hit the golf ball and practice and do everything in a standstill.
""But I haven't been able to get from point A to point B and we're obviously going to work on this,"" added Woods, who used a cart to get round the course in Orlando.
""It was a tough year but also one of the more rewarding years I've had in a while.

sports	Ora Washington: The 'queen of two courts' whose brilliance was ignored	"At a glitzy downtown New York hotel, the recently founded Black Athletes Hall of Fame was holding its annual ceremony. 
It was March 1976 and the host was giving a speech about the latest inductee. You probably won't know her name. 
Ora Washington was a champion, a star of two sports, but prejudice stopped her competing for the biggest prizes of the day. Her sporting career spanned three decades of change in her native United States, but change didn't come quickly enough. 
Washington retired from tennis and basketball in the 1940s. In the mid-1970s a new generation started to dig deeper into her story. Hence the gathering in New York. 
As the host finished introducing Washington to those gathered for that glamorous occasion, they started on something new: an apology. 
Washington wasn't there. There was a chair placed out on the stage for her, empty. The host said they were sorry but they hadn't been able to track her down.
New York Times wrote in its report the next day: ""The silver bowl, gold ring and medallion she was to receive have been returned to the Hall of Fame offices in New York. And Miss Washington's whereabouts remain a mystery.""
What nobody seemed to know was that Washington had already been dead for five years.  
BBC Sounds and the BBC World Service have made a podcast series about Washington's life. You can listen to episodes here.
Part of the motivation behind doing so was to get her story out there where it belongs, so it's not forgotten. 
Washington's is a powerful and important story. She was one of the most extraordinary Black female athletes of the 20th century. Tennis great Arthur Ashe described her as ""the first Black female to dominate a sport"". 
re are still lots of things we can't know about Washington, but we do know she received homophobic abuse, and that racism and white supremacy denied her both the opportunity and recognition she deserved. 
Washington's life threw up obstacles all along the way. And she took on the same types of injustice that many are still fighting today. 
Washington was born in January 1898 or 1899 - the records aren't clear. Her early life was spent in a small farming community called File in Caroline County, Virginia. 
Hers was a large, tight-knit family, and they owned a farm. They'd built up some economic independence by the standards of the day. Historian Pamela Grundy, who contributes to the podcast series, went there some years ago and found out Washington was the fifth of nine children. 
Grundy tracked down JB Childs, Washington's nephew, who shared his memories of the farm.
""They grew tobacco, corn wheat, rye and all sorts of vegetables,"" he told her. ""Tobacco was the biggest money strike. They raised tobacco and sold it in the winter - always have some for Christmas, whoever needed it. That's the way they made a living.""
My own family has its roots not too far away. My mom's grandma was born just a couple of years after Washington, in the neighbouring state of West Virginia. She was also raised in a farming area, and also under the Jim Crow laws. 
As residents of Virginia, the Washingtons lived under a web of legislation ensuring they would remain second-class citizens at every stage of their lives - formal segregation by race. 
Some examples: in 1900, when Washington first appeared in the United States census, Virginia passed a law forcing railroad companies to provide separate cars for Black and white riders. Another law did the same for steamboat passengers. Schools were segregated too - but not equal.   
Stories get passed down through families about those times in the South. It goes deeper than the law. We're talking about a whole culture of fear, touching every part of normal life. Fear of violence, fear of persecution. 
In 1910 the census man paid another visit to the farm, 10 years on from the last. This time, Washington is listed as 12 years old. Her mother is not listed. Her father is now a widower. 
When I picture that little girl growing up, living with dad and grandma and her brothers and sisters, with money short, I know they had to be hard times.
And that's why I think what happens next makes a lot of sense. 
At this time in the US there is a mass movement taking place. A movement that changed a nation.
Across the first quarter of the 20th century, Black American people were leaving the South and heading for the cities and jobs of the North: New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and many others. What historians call 'The Great Migration'.
We can't be sure when, but sometime in the 1910s a teenage Washington packed her bags and left the old family farm, and the South, for good. 
She took the train north to Philadelphia to join her Aunt Mattie, stepping into the big city for the first time, into a new life. The world she was entering was rich with newly emerging opportunities that previous generations of women - particularly Black women - never had, including organised sport.
When Washington next appears on the US census in 1920, she is listed as the younger of two servants working in a wealthy white home in the Philadelphia suburbs. 
Her introduction to tennis may have come around the same time, in the north Philadelphia district of Germantown, a place where new arrivals to the city - Italian, Irish, Black American - made their homes. She took lessons in the game at a branch of the Germantown Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) set up to ""make possible"" for girls and women of colour the ""advantages of so long enjoyed by the white girls and women of our community"".
Further detail of this time is thin on the ground. We don't have any surviving letters, and the few who interviewed her during her sporting career didn't publish anything about her personal life. 
However, there are surviving reports from Black newspapers like the Philadelphia Tribune - the oldest in the US (it was founded in 1884) and still publishing now. 
One article implies Washington first began competing in national Black women's competitions in 1923, possibly just a few years at most after first picking up a racquet. Another account describes her unique way of holding the racquet - almost halfway up the handle - and another the power of her volleys. 
Whenever she started, it's clear she was a natural. She would very soon take the sport by storm.
In 1925, Washington scored a huge victory by beating Isadora Channels, twice a winner of national championships organised by the American Tennis Association (ATA), a Black national tennis organisation founded in 1916.
It marked the start of her evolution as a player. She would move from being seen as a successful athlete to a once-in-a-generation talent. 
Also in 1925, the same year as her victory over Channels, Washington won her first tennis ATA doubles title. She went on to win that title every year up to 1936. In the singles game she would win the women's ATA trophy from 1929 to 1935. Seven years as champion at the top. 
Washington was a headliner who dominated Black sports media coverage, but this was still pre-war America. In contrast to another serial champion of this time - the white player Helen Wills, who won her seventh national title in 1931 - Washington's success was allowed to exist only in isolation. Not until 1950 would an African-American participate in the US Championships Wills was dominating - we know that tournament today as the US Open. 
re would be no mainstream superstardom, no merchandising or endorsement deals from international sportswear brands. The competitions she won didn't lead to global fame or untold riches. 
xt US census shows it. In 1930, Washington was working in Chicago as a hotel maid. 
Around the time of Washington's big tennis breakthrough in 1925, her name was also beginning to appear on lists of Black women's basketball teams as well.
By the end of the 1920s she was competing almost as much in basketball as in tennis, right at a time when she was picking up multiple tennis trophies across the country and building a reputation as the best Black female player in the US. 
One of the first basketball teams Washington played for was the Germantown YWCA Hornets - a so-called 'Black Fives team' or 'Black Quint' - 'Black' because these teams were only for Black players.  
She became a star as the team steadily rose. Reports of the day speak of outrageous long shots, of record scores that carried her side to victory. On 9 April 1931, the Hornets claimed the National Girls Basketball Title, beating Rankin Femmes, a team from near Pittsburgh, in the final. 
Mirroring her achievements in tennis, Washington had become the kind of basketball player people look forward to watching on the court. 
Philadelphia Tribune saw an opportunity and decided to sponsor a team. The Philadelphia Tribunes were coached by a prominent local activist called Joe Rainey - whose grandfather, also Joseph Rainey, was the first Black person to serve in the United States House of Representatives.
ribunes stood for more than sporting excellence, more than just advertising a local newspaper - or even about collecting trophies.
""Sport was seen as a really important place to argue for civil rights, in particular because sports was a performance of meritocracy, at least, in theory,"" says Dr Amira Rose Davis, assistant professor of history and African American studies at Penn State University.
""It was a place that many Black civic and political leaders saw as an opportunity to expand and demonstrate how Black folks were fit for citizenship.""
In 1932, Washington was recruited as captain of the Tribunes. The Tribune newspaper celebrated her exploits, holding her up as the star of a team that won 11 consecutive championships.
But despite this, at a time when sporting celebrities had already begun to emerge, there was never any coverage of her private life. Such focus did fall on other female athletes of the day - but only in a particular way. Washington did not fit that template.
""There was this policing of their sexuality, of their femininity,"" says Dr Rose Davis.
""Think of Black baseball player Toni Stone. They did a spread in a Black magazine about her and featured her in a dress because they wanted to show that she still was domestic. 
""They had a picture of her without her shirt on, laying down, getting rubbed down by her husband so they could demonstrate she was still heterosexual."" 
Whether Washington privately saw herself as more masculine or feminine, or as heterosexual or homosexual or anything else, is impossible to know from this distance. But some former members of the Bennett College team - against whom Washington played - shared memories of her when interviewed in the early 2000s by Rita Liberti, another contributor to the podcast. 
From what they said,external-link Washington was seen as different - as less feminine than the other players. 
While playing for the Tribunes, for the first time in her life Washington started to receive a small salary from sport. But she never was paid enough to give up the day job. 
She would continue working in domestic service as her dual sporting careers wound down, into the 1940s. When the time did come to retire, she didn't bow out quietly. 
In 1936, Washington lost the ATA singles title she'd held since 1929. The next year she won it back. She was 38, it was a fine time to step away. She announced her retirement from tennis singles, and sounded ready. 
""It does not pay to be national champion too long,"" she told the Baltimore African-American in a rare surviving interview. 
""It's the struggle to be one that counts. Once you've arrived, everybody wants to take it away from you.""
However, in 1938 a new force emerged, a young player named Flora Lomax, who seemed to talk up a feud with Washington in the press. 
gs became so heated that in 1939 Washington came out of retirement just to beat Lomax at a tournament in Buffalo, before shortly after retiring again, a remarkable final effort.  
Washington would continue playing doubles tennis though, right up until 1948, when she was 49 or 50. 
Her final title came in the mixed doubles at the ATA championships of 1947. On the opposite side of the net was Althea Gibson, then aged 19. 
In a photo of the pairs posing together, Washington wears long trousers and glasses, almost 30 years senior to the young star standing a few metres away and on the verge of landmark success. Gibson would in 1950 become the first Black player at the US nationals. Six years after that she would win the French Open, the first of her five Grand Slam singles titles.
Washington's final basketball game was played in 1942. But this part of her story speaks of a different kind of decline. 
When she began her basketball career in the '20s, the women's game was played according to the same rules as the men's. It was fast, competitive and physical. 
But by the mid-1930s things were beginning to change, with many of the college teams that formed the women's basketball landscape both in Black and in white sports moving towards what's known as 'participation play', focusing on group exercise rather than competitive action. 
In Washington's earlier career, women's basketball often took up around a third of the sports pages in the Philadelphia Tribune. By 1942, when Washington stepped away from the game at the age of 43 or 44, it had reduced to a trickle. That same year, the Tribunes women's team folded.
In 1950, the US census reports that Washington was sharing an apartment in Philadelphia with her brother Larry. She was still working in domestic service. 
We know Washington was always close with her family. But family seems to become even more central to her in later life. She co-owns this apartment with her sister, there is a cousin close by, and her young nephew JB Childs also spent time living in the same building. 
Years later he hinted to historian Pamela Grundy that his aunt was in a relationship with a woman. As far as we know, Washington never came out publicly, but we believe her sexuality is an important part of her story - and we'll hear from another of her relatives shortly.
Childs also told Grundy about trips back to the farm in Virginia, times of great celebration and joy that are remembered by two other family members in their contribution to our podcast series, Washington's great nephew Gregory Price and her great niece Patricia. 
But in terms of her place - her rightful place - in sporting history and the public consciousness, that began to slip away. So much so that when in 1976 the Black Athletes Hall of Fame sought to honour her, they didn't even know she had died. 
In 1969, two years before Washington's death at the age of 72 or 73, she was interviewed by Len Lear for a story with the Philadelphia Tribune. They met back where it all began for her: at the Germantown YWCA. Lear, now a veteran reporter for that newspaper, had never heard of her. 
""Once I met her and asked a lot of questions, I was absolutely floored,"" he says.
""It's just hard to imagine this today when you see people like Serena Williams, for example, making countless millions and having their name on perfume and all kinds of other products. And she had nothing. Nothing.
""She was getting old and she was not in great health, but to learn that she was possibly the best female athlete in the country in the first half of the 20th century [and] she was doing housekeeping… 
""She did not express anger or rage specifically. She was more or less, I would say, sad. Over what could have been and should have been. 
""She wanted to be recognised for her skills by everyone, and she wasn't.""
Washington's great nephew Gregory Price has another view. He doesn't remember her as sad.
""My sister and I are essentially the last living members of our families who knew her personally, who had actual personal contact with her. We're the last of that,"" he says. 
""You know, she seemed looming large, larger than life. She was tall and slim, she had a baritone voice and beautiful eyes. And when she looked at you, you saw sincerity in her eyes when she spoke.
""My aunt Ora was homosexual, we had no problem with her sexuality… [but] she was reclusive because of that, so I would imagine those who knew of her sexuality suppressed her accomplishments when she was at her best. They refused [to], even the Black community, let alone the white community because of racism back then. 
""They adored her as a player but off the court they refused to acknowledge her because of her sexuality. If she was alive today to see the changes that have taken place - racially, ethnically, sexually, she would be proud to say stand up and say: 'Yes, I'm gay.'
""This is nothing short of a hidden figure story. Someone who played two sports at the highest level, was a champion in both of those sports. [Larry] Bird, [Michael] Jordan, Magic [Johnson]… none of those guys can speak to that. Nobody in sports history.
""Anyone after us, they'll only know her through stories we now tell. I feel like that's my call to action. 
""Tell the story, and the facts will speak for themselves."""	/sport/63066765
sports	Marty Moore: Prop fully focused on Ulster rather than notion of Ireland recall	"Marty Moore says his main rugby mission is proving his worth to Ulster rather being pre-occupied with notions about a recall to the Ireland squad.
x-Leinster prop earned the last of his 10 Ireland caps in 2015 before the international door was closed during his Wasps stint between 2016 and 2018.
Moore moved to Ulster in 2018 and while he played for Ireland A in November, has not earned a further full cap.
He has battled mainly with Tom O'Toole for Ulster's tighthead spot.
O'Toole has been part of Ireland squads over the past two seasons while Moore, 31, apart from his call-up for the A game against an All Blacks selection last month, has not been in Andy Farrell's plans.
But asked whether he felt he had a point to prove to the Ireland coach, Moore insisted that all his focus is on impressing Dan McFarland and his backroom team.
""I feel like I have a point to prove but not necessarily in terms of Irish selection or Irish coaches, more to my own team-mates here and the coaches here that I deserve to play for this club and start games,"" Moore told Ulster's weekly news conference.
""I don't think there's much motivation or added motivation needed to what I do here week to week.""
And with Moore selected for the New Year's Day interpro against Munster at Kingspan Stadium, he added: ""I don't really need any added incentive to tear into that challenge.""
After being out of favour with Ireland for so long, Moore's inclusion in the A squad was a talking point for a game which saw the arguably third-string selection suffer a 47-19 hammering.
""It was still good to get a run out at that level and train in that system again,"" added the Dubliner, who came on as a replacement in the RDS game.
""Just getting a good week's work in whereas otherwise I would have probably been off and just back in in the gym here just keeping myself fit, so it was a bonus from that perspective. 
""It probably shows that games don't go unnoticed. That you're in the back of the mind when it comes to selection to an extent. 
""It does drive you a bit but it's been so many years now that it's not the driving factor [in terms of motivation] when it comes to how I play or whether I play good or back week in, week out because if it was, I'd be playing pretty bad after these years [of being out of Ireland favour]."" 
As for this weekend's game, Moore, like forwards coach Roddy Grant, is anticipating an improved Munster from the side which Ulster defeated in Limerick in late October, even though Peter O'Mahony and Tadhg Beirne are among big names who won't feature.
Moore's selection will see him battling with Munster loosehead Dave Kilcoyne, who was also part of the Ireland A squad last month.
""Everyone is hoping it will be what it should be, which is a proper interpro clash. Apart from the big European games, those are the ones that everyone savours the most when all the Irish players are there and you kind of go head-to-head with the best that there is to offer.""
After holding on to win 22-20 against Connacht in Galway despite the home team's late rally, another victory would further bolster belief in a side that suffered three successive defeats prior to last weekend's Sportsground contest.
""With Munster it's always a battle of breakdown and set-piece but especially breakdown and securing clean ball,"" added Moore.
""We did that in parts against Connacht. We could have been a little bit cleaner during periods of the game but it's just about controlling that territory and holding on to that ball against Munster."""	/sport/rugby-union/64110625

wo-time semi-finalist Aspinall, 31, came through the tough second-round tie 3-1 against Croatian Krcmar.
He wrapped up the match in the fourth set on double 18 after scoring his 14th 140 of the game.
In the afternoon session, two-time world champion Adrian Lewis suffered a third successive early exit.
Lewis, who won at Alexandra Palace in 2011 and 2012, was beaten 3-0 by Australian number 20 seed Damon Heta. 
It is the third year in a row in which the 37-year-old Englishman has been eliminated in round two.
Following his victory over Krcmar, world number 10 Aspinall told Sky Sports: ""I never make it easy. I think I robbed the first set to be fair, but likewise, I think I deserved the second set.

sports	CrossFit Games: Northern Ireland girl dubbed world's fittest teen after win	"A 15-year-old girl from Newtownards has been dubbed the world's fittest teenager after taking gold at the World CrossFit Games. 
Lucy McConigle secured the win for her age group at the event in Madison, Wisconsin last weekend.
She then went on to win two bronze medals at the European Youth Weightlifting Championships in Poland this week.
Her training regime covers a broad range of high-intensity disciplines.
CrossFit Games is an annual competition in which athletes are scored across a number of demanding exercises, such as weightlifting, burpees and pull-ups.
xercise regime was created by American Greg Glassman and there more than 15,000 CrossFit-affiliated gyms across 160 countries.
who win at the CrossFit Games are given the label of world's fittest, with Lucy the latest to join those ranks. 
Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster, Lucy explained the variety of training required.
""CrossFit is basically every sport mushed into one. There's gymnastics, running, biking... a whole load of high intensity interval-style training is what I do.
""I also do running, swimming, paddle boarding, weightlifting - (they) would be the main elements,"" she added.
was Lucy's first time winning gold at the competition, having been awarded a silver medal last year.
""I'm proud after I know all the effort that's gone into it. I feel like it's good to finally compete and get the title I thought I deserved,"" she said.
Lucy developed an interest in CrossFit from a young age, having previously been a keen swimmer, and is currently supported by her coach, Sam Duckett.
""From ten-years-old I recognised how good she was... probably from when Lucy was thirteen-and-a-half she also recognised how good she was, she won't admit it,"" he said.
Mr Duckett praised Lucy's talent in taking his feedback and being able to ""pick up things straight away"" as well as her willingness to push through a ""deep, dark cave"" of pain.
""Being very adaptable is key, the ability to learn really quickly - that's massive because there's so many disciplines and elements to it.
""It's the ability to work on your own for three, four hours a day and to be able to suffer pain more than the next person beside you who is also trying to be the fittest person in the world,"" he said.
""I think because I started when I was so young, it's always been that way, I haven't really had a chance to question it or think twice about it, I think it just comes naturally [dealing with pain],"" Lucy added. 
Having secured two medals at this year's European Youth Weightlifting Championships, in which she deadlifted 148kg, Mr Duckett is anticipating further success for Lucy.
""She's on that pathway with the Great British weightlifting team, towards competing in the Olympics someday. Our aim is to get her to compete as an individual."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-62589123
sports	Pele: Premier League and EFL players wear black armbands to honour footballing great	"Premier League and English Football League clubs wore black armbands and held a minute's applause before kick-off in this weekend's games in honour of Brazil legend Pele.
Scottish Professional Football League has also suggested all clubs pay their respects with a minute's applause or ""other appropriate gesture"".
ree-time World Cup winner Pele passed away on Thursday at the age of 82.
Brazil has declared three days of national mourning as tributes pour in.
Premier League tributes began at West Ham v Brentford, with the iconic image of Pele embracing Bobby Moore shown on the big screen at London Stadium. 
In the later kick-off, Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson and midfielder Jordan Henderson placed flowers on the centre circle at Anfield before the side's match against Leicester.
All 10 Premier League games over the weekend will hold similar tributes.
Before Saturday's match between Newcastle and Leeds at St James' Park, the hosts' Brazil midfielder Bruno Guimaraes wore a signed Pele Brazil shirt.
Speaking after Liverpool's 2-1 win over Leicester, Alisson told BBC Sport: ""I believe everyone from the world of football is feeling something about his loss. We Brazilians are grieving. He is a huge loss but at this moment we have to look to the things that he did because he changed the world of football, not just for Brazilians but for everybody.
""There is a lot of talk about who was the best and who is the best, but for us he is the best of all time. What he did on the pitch reflected the nation, he put the Brazilian flag at the highest standard, not just him but his team-mates as well.""
A minute's applause and black armbands were also seen at EFL fixtures on Friday and other clubs will follow suit on 1 and 2 January.
Football's world governing body Fifa has lowered flags at its headquarters in Switzerland to half-mast for Pele ""as a symbol of mourning and respect"".
Italian Football Federation (FIGC) says it has ""arranged a minute's silence to remember Pele,"" in forthcoming games, while Pele's contribution to the sport will similarly be recognised at matches in Spain and France this weekend.
Managers have also paid respect, with Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola saying Pele made football ""a better place"" for his ability to give people an emotional connection to the sport.
""There's not another show or event that can produce this type of emotion. It's part of what these exceptional players do,"" Guardiola explained. 
""Football is football thanks to these types of people, players, human beings. Before, the number 10 was just a number and after him it became something special. Every top player wanted to wear number 10 in their team.
""What he has done for football is there and always will remain.
""These type of players will be forever, they will be eternal.""
m manager Antonio Conte said Pele was ""one of the most important players in the world. We are talking about the story of football"".
He added: ""I was lucky to know him and honestly I am really sad for his death. Also because Pele was a person who was an important person for football. One of the most popular. Maybe the most popular player in football.
""His behaviour, it was always a person who lived without arrogance and showed always to be a humble person despite, in my opinion with [Diego] Maradona being the best players in the world.""
Arsenal's Mikel Arteta said: ""He was probably the most complete player that the game has ever seen, and it is a big loss.""
Newcastle manager Eddie Howe hailed the Brazil great as an ""absolute giant"" of football.
""In my era, you grew up knowing of Pele, thinking of him as the best player the world had ever seen at that moment,"" Howe added.
""It's very, very sad. Whenever an icon passes away, it's a very sad moment for football. Seeing the reaction of everybody, media, everyone connected with football, he's certainly well remembered around the world.""
Everton manager Frank Lampard said: ""The reach of his game was huge and has stayed. That name will continue for ever more. It's a sad day for football.""
Scottish Professional Football League's chief executive Neil Doncaster said: ""Scottish football fans appreciate skill, class and achievement, and no player in the game better typified those qualities than Pele.""
Fulham will pay tribute to Pele before their celebrations of the life of club stalwart and 1966 World Cup winner George Cohen.
Cohen died on 23 December and Fulham's home match against Southampton on Saturday will be their first game at Craven Cottage since his passing."	/sport/football/64125638
sports	PDC World Championship: Josh Rock beats Callan Rydz to reach third round	"Northern Ireland's Josh Rock reached the third round at the PDC World Championship with a 3-0 dismissal of England's Callan Rydz.
World youth champion Rock, 21, did not need to produce his best form to overcome last year's quarter-finalist, who struggled badly with his doubles.
Rydz missed a shot at double 16 which would have taken a nervy first set with Rock's double four moving him 1-0 up.
As Rydz's woeful finishing continued, Rock lost only two further legs.
Despite playing in his debut championship at Alexandra Palace, the Antrim native has been touted as a title contender and while his own scoring and finishing flagged at times on Wednesday, victory sets up a third-round meeting with two-time world semi-finalist Nathan Aspinall.
""I'm glad I got the win but Callan didn't play his game and I still haven't played my game yet,"" Rock told Sky Sports after his win.
""I know there's more to come from Josh Rock. When you stand up on this stage, obviously there's different pressure on you. You have to learn to deal with it.""
Rock missed double 14 as Rydz moved 1-0 in the opening set but the Englishman's double troubles then really surfaced as he missed three chances which allowed the Northern Irishman to level.
Further Rydz failures on double top saw Rock edge 2-1 up and after the Antrim man missed the same double in leg four, the Newcastle player's errant shot at double 16 in leg five was punished as his opponent took the set with a double-four finish.
Rydz's nightmare day with his finishing continued in set two as Rock clinched it 3-1 after losing the first leg and it was the same margin in set three.
Rock managed to hit only 36% of his doubles and his scoring average was just over 92 but those statistics still proved enough against the Englishman who notched just four of his 27 doubles.
In the first match of Wednesday's afternoon session, Cork man John O'Shea lost a 2-0 lead as he was edged out 3-2 by Darius Labanauskas as the Lithuanian secured a tense victory despite several stunning scoring bursts by his opponent."	/sport/darts/64056449

sports	Winter Olympics: Team GB will 'lick their wounds' after Beijing 'disappointment', says UK Sport chief	"Great Britain will ""lick their wounds"" after a disappointing Winter Olympics, and come back ""roaring and fighting"" for Milan-Cortina in 2026, UK Sport CEO Sally Munday said.
m GB won just two medals at Beijing 2022, falling short of their target of three to seven.
women's curlers beat Japan to win gold on the final day of the Games after the men won silver on Saturday.
Munday said she was ""thrilled"" for the curlers after a ""disappointing"" Games.
medal haul was short of the five won at the previous two Games but there were a number of near misses as well, with three top-six finishes.
Asked why Britain's two medals came from one sport and they were not more competitive across more disciplines, Munday told BBC Sport it was ""probably too soon to jump to conclusions"".
""What is really important is that we review properly,"" she said.
""We ask all of the sports to do their reviews and we will look at all the contributing factors that go into making medal-winning performances. We really get under the skin of why it is that some that we thought might achieve success here didn't. 
""Was it simply an error on the day, which can happen in the sports that we have here? 
""Or are there things that are deeper than that? 
""I think you probably liken us to a wounded lion. We'll lick our wounds, we'll work out what needs to be different and we will come back fighting and roaring for Milan-Cortina.""
More than £22m was spent on funding the sports at Beijing 2022external-link, with some receiving larger contributions than others.
£9.53m was spent on ski and snowboarding, and £6.42m was awarded to skeleton, with neither producing medals.
Meanwhile, Brad Hall's four-man bobsleigh team felt their sixth-place finish was ""like a medal"" after having to self fund their Olympic dream.
""Clearly a lot of money has gone into some of the sports that have come back with nothing and people, I suppose, will want answers as to why they haven't delivered the medals that you thought they would,"" added Munday.
""The sports will do their own reviews and I think that's important to get to the heart of the questions that will need to be answered. 
""We will then sit down with each sport as part of our annual review process and get under the skin of what it is that they have learnt.""
Speaking about the sixth-place finish in the men's bobsleigh, Munday added: ""A massive congratulations to Brad and the team to achieve what they have, and the way they went about their determination to self fund. 
""It is really impressive and so huge congratulations to them for what they have achieved here. I can't look back and say what I could and couldn't change in the past. 
""What we can do is make sure that we review all of the sports.""
However, Munday said success has to be measured in ""greater terms"" than just the return of medals.
She added: ""We're disappointed with where we are and there's no shying away from that, but I've heard brilliant stories over the last couple of weeks of ice rinks and snow domes being packed to the rafters and people desperate to get in the door. 
""The medal moments make us feel fantastic, but the definition of success for us is wider than simply the medals.""
Munday's comments of disappointment were echoed by British Olympic Association chief executive Andy Anson, who acknowledged some difficult decisions lay ahead.
Anson also said more support should be offered to events with bigger teams rather than excellent individuals.
""We don't want to hide away from the fact that there will be sports and athletes going home who will be disappointed with the way things have gone out here,"" Anson told BBC Sport.
""It would have been nice to have achieved some medals on the snow and in the skeleton and bobsleigh, but that did not happen for whatever reason.""
Speaking about the disappointment around some sports, Anson added: ""We have not gone into it in detail, but there's different reasons in different sports. 
""I think we have to take each sport differently. So skeleton not winning a medal is different to not winning a medal in skiing or snowboarding. 
""In skiing and snowboarding there is so much jeopardy, and when we only have one athlete in each event, it is really difficult to win medals consistently.
""With UK Sport, we will work with the national governing bodies to make sure the strategy about really getting behind those teams where there is strength in depth, versus into individual athletes who just need supporting because they are individuals who are good. 
""They're on the circuit doing very, very well and they need supporting, but maybe that is different, and supporting a whole team and a whole sport is what we have all got to get our heads around.""
Games were overshadowed by Kamila Valieva, the 15-year-old Russian figure skater who failed a drugs test.
Valieva helped her team win Winter Olympic gold in Beijing, after producing a positive test for the banned substance trimetazidine in December.
result was only reported the day after the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) won team gold, and Anson said the whole story was a ""tragedy"".
""It's awful that a 15-year-old girl is testing positive for banned substances,"" he said. ""There is no upside to that for anyone at all and it's a horrific story. 
""We spoke to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) straight away and we pushed them to say that the whole entourage is properly investigated because we need to know if it is indicative of a more systematic issue that's going on still in Russia. 
""If it is then the sanctions haven't worked and we need to revisit that.
""But for me, as the father of a daughter, seeing a 15-year-old girl having illegal substances in her is horrendous. So we have to do something about it. The whole sporting world needs to do something about it because it's not acceptable."""	/sport/winter-olympics/60451757

sports	Netball Scotland: Claire Nelson outlines vision for future	"""I'm on a mission and I believe in what I'm doing.""
Netball Scotland chief executive Claire Nelson is juggling family life and helping to steer the sport through the coronavirus pandemic.
Netball was one of four Scottish sports to share a £1m Scottish government grant to mitigate the absence of crowds this week, with some funding going to Strathclyde Sirens, the country's only professional team.
Sirens are playing competitively again in the Superleague - with matches played behind closed doors - but grassroots netball has yet to resume nationwide. 
""It will be a slow, safe and gradual return,"" Nelson told BBC Scotland's Women In Sport podcast. 
""It's about getting people out of their isolation, their lockdown and get them back into that thing that makes them feel connected and happy.""
40-year-old mother of four believes that women's sport has a pivotal role to play in life post-lockdown.
""I believe that it can be very powerful in impacting and changing the way women see their bodies; the way we talk and the opportunities that we have. I see it as a platform for change and that's why it's so important,"" she said.
""This isn't just about a winning team and lifting medals, it's about what sport can do and the power that sport has on females. That's what keeps me going every day.
""I can't do things by half. I was never just going to clock in and clock out. 
""It's been a challenge: having a big family and my two youngest daughters - who are 16 months apart. My youngest was born with a heart tumour and I found that out when I was pregnant. 
""All of these forced huge changes in our lives in how we work, how we operate and what's important to us. Having four children - three daughters - and the youngest of which we really had to grapple with her health and whether she's going to survive, puts everything into perspective."" 
Nelson describes the £100,000 funding [for Strathclyde Sirens] to offset the absence of crowd income as ""an absolute lifeline"" that has got them through a difficult season.
""Netball Scotland is in a difficult position at the moment,"" she said. ""Because we're an indoor team contact sport, when we suspended all netball almost exactly one year ago to the day, we haven't been able to restart.
""We have created a modified version of the game, which has yet to be approved by the Scottish government, but the biggest challenge we face is access to facilities.
""The majority of our clubs train in school halls, but the school estate is non-existent at the moment and we can't go into schools and start training with our clubs. And the local trusts, sports halls and leisure centres are all on their knees themselves. 
""Our restart and recovery is reliant on us being able to access those facilities.""  
In terms of her own career, Nelson says: ""I'm very passionate about what I do, but I understand where it sits in my life and it allows me to have a huge resilience. I know why I'm doing this, I'm doing it for my daughters and for my children to have a better life and for them to see a strong role model and a mum who uses her voice.
""So many people see the chief executive of something as like the end of the road; I feel like I'm at the beginning of something magnificent. My kids are at the age where they're coming on this journey with me."""	/sport/netball/56347439
sports	The Open: Young Tom Morris, Old Tom Morris and how it all began	"Young Tom Morris was just 13 years old when he first beat his dad. This was no ordinary victory though. Old Tom Morris was the reigning Open champion.
Scot would go on to become the youngest Open champion, winning the 1868 title at the age of 17, and also the next three to set records that are yet to be bettered some 150 years later. However, his life ended in tragic circumstances at the age of 24, dying of what many say was a broken heart.
week's Radio 5 Live Sport podcast, building up to July's 150th Open Championship, looks at the tournament's humble origins and the stories around those pioneers who founded what has become the oldest and most revered of all majors.
It all began with the death of Allan Robertson in 1859.
""He was the champion golfer In the 1840s and 1850s,"" said renowned golf historian Roger McStravick. ""He was untouchable. Some competitions wouldn't let him play because he was so good. 
""But when he died, aged 43, he left that question, who is the champion golfer and that is why Prestwick created the Open Championship.""
Prestwick had only been in existence for nine years when it hosted the first Open on the afternoon of 17 October, 1860. Eight golfers whizzed around the 12-hole links course three times and had a spot of lunch at the Red Lion in five hours.
""It comes as a surprise to many to hear that the Open was first played at Prestwick because it tends to be assumed it must have been at St Andrews,"" says club archivist Andrew Lochhead.
""The reason it came to Prestwick is James Ogilvie Fairlie, an Ayrshire landowner who had been captain of the Royal & Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews.""
Fairlie wanted to build a course on the west coast of Scotland and in 1851 recruited Old Tom, who had just been fired by Robertson for using a new-fangled guttie ball that was threatening the featherie that Robertson made and sold.
""It shows how much respect Old Tom had for Fairlie to leave St Andrews,"" said Lochhead. ""It was a big leap of faith to move across country with his wife and son to a place he'd never visited before.
""He became Prestwick's keeper of the greens, ball and club maker and it was thanks to the skills of Morris that the 12-hole course quickly established its credentials as a proper test of golf.""
In the mid-19th Century golf was an expensive hobby, predominantly for the rich, so the professionals, like Robertson and Old Tom, made a living from playing for bets, being employed as a caddie or making balls and clubs. 
Many players would bring their caddies to Prestwick from the east coast of Scotland and, following the death of Robertson, Fairlie invited 11 clubs, 10 in Scotland and Blackheath in London, to send a ""respectable caddie"" to determine his successor.
winning prize, donated by the Earl of Eglington, was a red Moroccan leather 'Challenge Belt', thought to be influenced by his passion for sports like boxing and medieval pageantry.
Willie Park senior of Musselburgh edged out Old Tom by two strokes to become the first champion.
""Tom designed Prestwick so he would have been favourite,"" said McStravick. ""He was looking really strong and then fell in the last couple of holes. He would have felt like he'd let everybody down.
""He was the best golfer in the world and he would go on to win it in 1861, 62, 64 and 67.""
Park would also go on to win four titles, as would Young Tom, who won all his in successive competitions.
""Young Tom was the Tiger Woods of his day,"" continued McStravick. ""He was the first all-out professional. He was not a ballmaker, he was not a caddie, just a professional through and through. When he went on tours in England he was paid to play.
""He won the Open Championship three times as a teenager, aged 17, 18 and 19.
""He was exceptional and took the game to a different level.""
His victory as a 17-year-old still stands as a record as the youngest major champion, while no player since has matched his run of four successive titles.
mmy registered The Open's first hole-in-one in 1869 and the following year he became the first player to average under four strokes per hole when he carded a 47 for 12 holes. His cause was helped by holing his third shot from 200 yards at the 578-yard opening hole in the first round - this was at a time before holes had par scores.
""According to the rules of The Open when it started, if anyone won the belt three years in a row they got to keep it so Young Tom won it outright in 1870,"" said Angela Howe, the R&A World Golf Museum's heritage director.
Because there was no prize sorted in time for 1871, the event was not played. But by 1872, the Royal & Ancient Golf Club, Prestwick and the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers had put their heads together and come up with a new trophy - the Claret Jug.
Young Tom was victorious for a fourth successive time but although the trophy was not ready for presentation, his name was the first to be etched on it.
""The game was exploding and Tommy was King,"" said McStravick, ""and it's tragic how it all ended"".
It was 1875 and Tommy and his father had just won a big money match at North Berwick when he received a telegram to say his wife was in labour. Before they could set off in the boat back to St Andrews - the Morris family had returned to the east coast in 1864 - another telegram arrived saying his wife had died in childbirth.
""He was just broken-hearted. For the next three months he was inconsolable,"" said McStravick. 
""People tried to get him to play matches and he did play one. At 4UP he broke down and lost the last five holes.""
mmy moved back in with his parents. He spoke with them on Christmas Eve before saying goodnight but when he didn't appear in the morning, his dad went to wake him.
Old Tom found his son lying in his bed. He was 24 and had effectively bled to death of a burst aneurysm in his left lung.
""It was tragic,"" said McStravick. ""It's like Tiger Woods dying before his seventh major. What would he have won? What could he have done? How many courses would he have designed? He was such a maverick."""	/sport/golf/61641438

Karate, skateboarding and surfing have already made their debuts, so now the focus switches to the walls in the Aomi Urban Sports Park.
Here we take you through everything you need to know, from how the sport works to which stars you should keep an eye on.
It's an event that neatly embodies the revised Olympic motto 'faster, higher, stronger, together' - with competitors climbing walls using fixed hand and foot holds in three disciplines.
men's competition will start on 3 August, with finals on 5 August. The women's event begins on 4 August, with finals on 6 August.
re are two gold medals up for grabs in Tokyo, with combined events for both men and women.
Forty climbers will be in action - 20 per competition, with each nation allowed a maximum of two people in each.
Climbing events usually include three separate disciplines - speed, bouldering and lead - but for the sport's Olympic debut they have been pulled together into bumper combined events.
At the 2024 Paris Games, speed will be a separate event, alongside a joint bouldering/lead competition.
Speed: Two competitors race against each other to the top of a 15m high wall with a five degree overhang and have to hit a buzzer to stop the clock. The route is the same in every competition.
Bouldering: Climbers take turns to complete routes, known as problems, on a 4.5m structure in as few attempts as possible. They can have as many attempts as they like within a set time. Scores are determined by the number of problems either fully or partially solved. The problems are reset between qualification and finals and the climbers are allowed two minutes to observe the problem before the finals.
Lead: Competitors must climb as high as they can up a 15m wall within six minutes in one attempt. The route is changed between qualification and the finals and athletes are allowed to look prior to the finals.

Borders Ice Rink in Kelso plays host to almost 400 curlers, as well as dozens of skaters.
But refrigeration breakdowns often led to unplanned closures and cancellations as the ice started to melt.
week a cheque for £75,000 was handed over by the Fallago Environment Fund.
Andrew Wemyss, chair of the Borders Ice Rink, said: ""The plant machinery we have just now is outdated, unreliable, and very difficult to find parts for.
""This curling season was delayed by two weeks because of the latest breakdown.
""This amazing grant will allow us to have good, reliable plant machinery that will keep the ice how we want it, and also be more efficient and lead to lower bills.""
Borders Ice Rink first opened in 1964, and has produced several international players, including 2007 senior world champions Keith Prentice and Tommy Fleming, world junior silver medallist Cameron Bryce, and world junior gold medallist from last year, Angus Bryce.

David Melrose from Duns, who was part of the GB team that claimed silver at the 2019 world wheelchair curling championships, is delighted that the system is to be replaced.
He said: ""If the rink wasn't here I would have to travel to Stirling or Edinburgh for training facilities.
""It's a very well used rink and it is important that we have a reliable ice-making plant.""
A total of 24 curling clubs use the Borders Ice Rink for practice and tournaments.
Gareth Baird, chair of the Fallago Environment Fund, handed over the cheque this week.

sports	London 2012: Ten years on, what lessons can we learn from London’s legacy?	"""Our vision is to see millions more young people in Britain and across the world participating in sport and improving their lives as a result of that participation. And London has the power to make that happen.""
So said Prime Minister Tony Blair in a speech to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on 6 July 2005, the day London was awarded the right to host the 2012 Olympics.
rs on from the start of the Games, what is London's sporting legacy?
What lasting impact did those halcyon days have, beyond the enduring memories of the excitement and pride it generated? The answer is both complex and contested. 
In terms of facilities, five of the original venues from the Olympics are still being used.
roubled finances of the iconic London Stadium - now home to Premier League football club West Ham of course - have been the source of significant controversy. Not only was the £320m bill for converting it after the Games twice the original estimate, but the loss-making facility still costs taxpayers around £8m-10m a year to run. 
rd successive year the stadium has failed to host track and field, and UK Athletics is considering a move away from the stadium, where it has a 50-year lease, to be able to stage events during a short window every summer. 
More encouraging is the extension of a partnership bringing Major League Baseball to the venue. 
rome, meanwhile, will host the track cycling at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games. 
redeveloped, bustling Queen Elizabeth Park - where members of the public can swim and cycle at modified facilities originally used for the Games, and where there is now a cultural and education district as well as a tech and innovation hub - stands in stark contrast to the abandoned facilities that have blighted some other former Olympic host cities. 
usands of jobs have been created and 11,000 new homes in the wider area have been completed, although affordable housing targets have been missed, with fears some local people have been priced out of the area.
And yet the 10-year anniversary of the Games comes at a time when more than a quarter of adults in England are officially inactive, and obesity rates among primary school children have hit record highs. A time when half of British women do no regular exercise. 
A new survey by the Sports Think Tank has found that 61% of leaders in the sports sector feel the Games did not deliver the legacy promises made, with the biggest failure identified as the core commitment to 'inspire a generation'.external-link
So was what seemed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make us healthier and more active squandered?
Lord Coe, who chaired the organising committee, believes that without the Games the current situation could be even graver.
""The worst that you can say is we actually staunched the haemorrhaging of participation,"" the president of World Athletics says.
""It was never going to be a straight line on a graph. Many of the sports we've looked towards to improve physical inactivity have actually done very well. More people are cycling and running than ever before. 'Parkruns' are now part of our national heritage. More people are doing triathlons.
""One of the things about inspiring a generation was to make sure we had better and stronger Olympic teams, and there's no question we have gone from strength to strength.
""That's made a big difference, and one of the profoundest legacies has been the way people have reviewed their thinking around disability.""
As Lord Coe suggests, the medal haul delivered by British athletes at London confirmed the country's status as an Olympic and Paralympic powerhouse, set standards and expectations that were then met at the two subsequent Games, helped make the case for continued funding for the country's high-performance system, and certainly inspired some people to be active. 
ke British sprinter Desiree Henry for instance. Back in 2012, the Londoner was one of seven unknown teenagers to help light the torch at the climax of the opening ceremony. Four years later, she became an Olympic medallist in Rio, and says the experience of a home Games spurred her on to realise her dreams.
But there have also been fears that hosting the Games might have meant too great an emphasis was placed on winning at the expense of athlete welfare, contributing to the spate of bullying scandals to blight British sport in recent years.
London legacy has also been tainted by cheating, with more than 140 athletes who competed at the event found guilty of doping violations after the retesting of samples, making it officially the dirtiest Games in history. 
According to a recent National Audit Office report, the proportion of adults participating in sport actually declined in the three years following the Games. It said national participation rates then increased modestly between 2016 and 2019, but deep-rooted inequalities remain, with rates of exercise among women, people from ethnic minorities and those in poorer communities of particular concernexternal-link.
""Do we have an active and happy and healthy generation of young people as a result of London 2012? No we don't,"" says Ali Oliver, chair of the Youth Sports Trust.
""This is where discussion about legacy needs to go a little bit deeper. It did inspire some changes [such as] inclusive and disability sport. We deliver the 'School Games' programme to 21,000 schools, and that was a London initiative.  
""But the fact that we've lost 42,000 hours of PE in our schools since London, and have thousands fewer PE teachers, is a signal that the societal shift hasn't happened. We are not seeing PE and school sport of equal value to English, maths and science. 
""In 2017, one in nine young people had a mental health condition; it's now one in six. These are the big blocks to legacy.""
Youth Sport Trust is part of a new coalition including the Sport for Development Coalition, Sport and Recreation Alliance and leisure industry umbrella group UKActive, which this month called for ""radical change"" in the sector. The government has said it is preparing to unveil a new sports strategy.
relevant at a time when there are concerns over the extent to which Britain's Olympic teams reflect the nation they represent. At last year's Tokyo Games, 35% of Team GB medallists had been to private school, even though only 7% of the population has received such an education. Sport England board member Chris Grant, one of the country's most senior black sports administrators, estimates that around a third of the country's Olympic sports have never selected an athlete who was not whiteexternal-link. 
Beyond long-established concerns over sport and PE provision in schools, many believe London's legacy may have been undermined by a range of other factors; from the impact that cuts to local authority budgets have had on community sport and leisure facilities, to the effects of Covid lockdowns and the current cost of living crisis. 
re remains no national plan for sport and activity, the key recommendation of a House of Lords committee following an inquiry into inactivity last year. 
Former Olympic cyclist Chris Boardman, the chairman of Sport England - the body responsible for distributing public money to improve participation and activity levels - told me the 2012 Games ""proved that just holding a magnificent sporting event is not enough to create a legacy"".
""It took a few years for that message to get through and things have started to change now,"" he said.
""'Legacy' is an easy word to say, but it takes sustained investment in the right places. We want real change in activity. We have to get into communities, and that takes time to set up and we are on that mission now.""
relevant on the eve of Birmingham's Commonwealth Games, at a cost of £780m, the most expensive sports event the UK has hosted since London 2012. 
Rather than simply assuming hosting a major event will automatically translate into greater participation, Sport England says it is already investing nearly £35m to help leave a lasting legacy from Birmingham 2022, targeting areas of highest inactivity, and directly funding more projects that lie outside the traditional network of sports governing bodies. 
A similarly proactive approach is being taken in the run-up to this autumn's Rugby League World Cup where £600,000 of initial funding tied to the event has been used to generate an additional £25m of investment, helping local communities with facilities, access and various schemes. 
Instead of the more abstract concept of 'legacy', organisers prefer to talk about 'social impact', something they believe can be more easily measured.
re important signs, perhaps, that when it comes to translating the hosting of events into positive change, one legacy of London is that valuable lessons have been learned. "	/sport/olympics/62299772

Briton recovered with 14 successive hits to climb into medal contention.
But he had to settle for bronze, Czech pair Jiri Liptak and David Kostelecky taking gold and silver respectively.
Coward-Holley scored 33 out of 40 in the final, missing out on a gold medal play-off by one shot to Liptak, who went on to defeat compatriot Kostelecky in a sudden-death shoot-off.
""Being my first Olympic final, the first little bit is always that little bit of tension, that little bit of nerves,"" Coward-Holley said.
""But you've just got to relax and trust yourself that you can do it.

sports	Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Watching Andy Murray from prison was joyful	"Listen: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe tells Andy Murray of the joy his Wimbledon victory gave her in prison
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in solitary confinement for months, separated from her husband and young daughter, when her Iranian jailers provided a rare glimmer of joy. 
In July 2016, after months without books or newspapers, she was granted access to a TV with two channels - one showing Iranian soaps, the other Wimbledon tennis matches. 
""They had no idea what they had given me,"" she said.
From the notorious Evin prison, she watched as Andy Murray secured his second Wimbledon title on Centre Court - more than 3,000 miles from her prison cell, but just a little over an hour on the Tube from her home in north London. 
More than six years later - and nine months after she was released - the 45-year-old met Murray and shared the personal significance of that match, as part of her guest edit of Radio 4's Today programme.
""I was always a big fan of you, but also there I was in solitary confinement watching the match that you actually won in the end,"" she told Murray. ""I can't tell you how joyful it was and I was ecstatic just to see you win.""
She had vowed to email Murray on her release and hoped to find tickets to watch the following year's final, she recalled. 
""That never happened because I was in prison for such a long time,"" she said.
Later, after having been moved out of solitary confinement, Nazanin taught other inmates Murray's name and the story of his tournament victory. 
""It felt like a connection, it felt like escape,"" she said. ""I was close to home all of a sudden."" 
Murray, who was visibly moved, said it was ""by far the strangest, most incredible story that I've been told about someone watching me"". 
Listening to her experience of that day had been ""quite emotional"" and put issues in his own life - like back and knee pain - into context, he said. 
""We all have our own problems, but after listening to you and speaking to you I'll certainly make sure I'm a lot more grateful for everything that I've got,"" he said. 
Nazanin, a British-Iranian national, had been detained in 2016 as she was about to fly home from a visit to Iran with her two-year-old daughter. 
Iranian authorities alleged she was plotting to topple the government in Tehran. She has always denied the accusations and insisted she had taken her daughter to visit family. 
She was released in March, following a sustained campaign by her British husband Richard Ratcliffe.
Murray, who asked Nazanin several questions about her experience, said he would ""feel very angry"" if he was in her position. 
""I would be interested to hear how you feel about it all. You seem absolutely fine now, but I'm thinking if I was in that situation or someone that I knew was in that situation, that I would feel very angry about that,"" he said.
Nazanin replied: ""At times I do feel very angry, but I guess there was a point that I decided I should put the anger away and to not carry it with me, because otherwise it will eat me up for the rest of my life.""
Asked by Murray about life in prison, Nazanin said she would ""take refuge in the library"" reading books on philosophy and history, and spent much of her time cooking and doing craftwork alongside fellow inmates. 
""When I came out, there were times that I felt like I really missed my friends and missed prison,"" she said.
""It's a very odd thing to say. I don't know whether people actually can say that you miss prison, but I sometimes think that I miss the environment and my friendships in prison.""

sports	Paris 2024: UK Sport will invest £352m in British sports for 2024 Olympics and Paralympics	"UK Sport says it will invest £352m in British sports for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris. 
funding will be split across 43 Olympic and Paralympic sports and represents an increase on the £345m allocated for the Tokyo Games.
New additions climbing, skateboarding and surfing have all been funded.
However, some traditional sports like athletics, gymnastics, rowing and swimming have all had budgets cut by around 10%.
Sailing, canoeing, equestrian and modern pentathlon have also seen reductions while badminton has seen a significant increase and GB wheelchair rugby has had its funding restored. The sport received £3m in total in the run up to Rio 2016 but had all funding removed after failing to win a medal at the Games. 
med two European titles and climbed to number four in the world.
Britain won 67 medals at Rio 2016 and claimed 64 gold medals in the Paralympics.
British Rowing chief executive Andy Parkinson said he was not surprised to see a cut of around £2.4m for the sport in ""difficult economic times"". 
However, his counterpart at Pentathlon GB, Sara Heath, said she was ""disappointed & perplexed"" by a reduction of just over 20%. 
In a statement, Pentathlon GB said it intended to lodge an appeal, with Heath stressing a ""lack of parity... across the sports receiving this crucial funding"".
On the decision to cut funding for a number of sports, UK Sport chief executive Sally Munday said: ""These are pretty tough times in terms of the financial envelope that is available to us and we have looked across the piece. 
""We wanted to reach more sports than we've ever been able to before and as a result we have had to make some pretty tough decisions.
""I believe that the sports that have been consistently successful will continue to be successful with the funding that they have received.""
An additional new fund worth £3m will also be open to applications from other sports such as breaking, which is set to feature at the Olympics in Paris for the first time.
UK Sport is expected to expected to assess breaking's potential over the next 12 months as they did when climbing, skateboarding, surfing and karate were all added to the Olympic programme for the first time.
While the number of sports receiving funding has widened from 32 to 43, some of Britain's most successful have lost out.
In rowing, funding fell by almost 10%, while swimming (11.4%) and equestrian (11.6%) also saw sizable drops.
However, archery saw its funding more than double, badminton's rose by around £2.5m (up by over 300%) and cycling got an increase of 12%"	/sport/olympics/55367946
sports	DP World Tour Championship: Tommy Fleetwood boosted by home comforts in Dubai	"Fresh from posting his first victory for three years Tommy Fleetwood will prepare for European golf's season finale by doing the school run. 
DP World Tour Championship is just a buggy ride away from the Englishman's new home in Dubai and Fleetwood can make the shortest of journeys to and from the course knowing he is completing a golf season of genuine progress.
His thrilling win in last week's Nedbank Challenge in South Africa has lifted the 31-year-old from Southport to 23 in the world, his highest ranking since March 2021. It was his first triumph since winning the same South African tournament back in 2019.
""I don't win anywhere near as much as I would like to but I think winning is such a lovely feeling,"" Fleetwood told BBC Sport.  ""It's what everybody out here is constantly working for. 
""That's the ultimate goal at the end of the week. So it's been a long wait.""
Following his success at Sun City he somewhat philosophically tweeted ""the moment of victory is so beautiful but far too short to live for"".
Asked to expand on that, Fleetwood said: ""You don't win very often at all, even the greatest players of all time don't win every time they tee it up. 
""But if you can go out there and you can enjoy it and you can feel like you're doing everything you can to succeed, that's that's all you can do really but you can fall out of that very easily. 
""I've had plenty of times where I've not enjoyed it. I've had great results and not enjoyed the week. 
""And I would much rather have a great time and feel like I've got something out the week, feel like I've enjoyed chasing my dreams and and that's what I think everybody should do.""
And Fleetwood is clearly enjoying his change of location, having decamped with his wife, son and two stepsons to the United Arab Emirates from the north west of England earlier this year. Now this week's tournament feels like a home event.
""It's been great really,"" Fleetwood said. ""It's always a bit daunting whenever you make a move somewhere but we were wanting to give it a go and so far we're very, very happy.""
It will be unfamiliar to play this $10m (£8.4m) event and be able to sleep in his own bed but Fleetwood is relishing the change.
""It's a little bit different. I can drive drive the buggy into the golf course for the week,"" he said.
""It'll be nice just playing and being able to pop back home. My dad's here this week, which I'm really excited about and it is great to see him. 
""It's a bit odd playing a tournament when you're doing the school run in the morning but it's a nice bit of normality.""
And for Fleetwood just as refreshing is the fact that playing good golf and contending have become the norm once again. This year he posted his best ever results in the Masters (14th) and US PGA Championship (fifth) as well as finishing in a share of fourth place at the Open.
""I was obviously doing a lot of good things and then to come back and eventually find that form again was great,"" he added.
""The CJ Cup (fourth behind Rory McIlroy in South Carolina) was a great week for me.
""I played fantastic there and then a win (last week), so I've definitely made progress and my world ranking has started to rise again.
""The consistency of my game is much, much better. Golf is a lot more stress free when you feel like you're not going to lose the ball and if you feel like you've given yourself a chance each and every week of having a good week.""
Fleetwood finished a shot behind Jon Rahm in the 2019 Tour Championship here. Back then he was in the world's top 10 and current evidence suggests he might be on track to return to that elite level.
Another big performance this week would certainly help in that regard. And it would be fuelled by benefits of home comforts."	/sport/golf/63639489
sports	Shauna Coxsey: British Olympian defends climbing while pregnant	"Britain's most decorated elite climber Shauna Coxsey has defended her decision to continue the sport while pregnant.
29-year-old, who retired from competitive climbing after the sport's Olympic debut in Tokyo, is 38 weeks pregnant with her first child.
But her choice has led to some criticism on social media.
""Everyone assesses risk differently and I think people perceive me climbing as risky when I am actually climbing so well within my comfort zone,"" she said.
Speaking to Radio 5 Live, she added: ""It feels way more risky for me to walk down the street. I feel much more likely to trip over on a bumpy road than I do to go up an easy climbing wall.""
Coxsey created history in Tokyo as Britain's first competitor in the sport and finished 10th overall after being hampered by a back injury.
uble World Championship bronze medallist has been involved in the sport since she was three years old.
""If I don't climb for a week or so, my body feels quite clunky and everything gets a bit achy,"" she added.
""As soon as I get back on that wall and start stretching and moving again, my body feels more connected and good and strong and also my mental health as well. 
""I can't imagine stopping if I didn't need to and I haven't needed to and it feels great. I've been really fortunate.
""I wouldn't put my baby in danger. People think I might be able to fall and land on my stomach - which is something I have never ever done or seen happen before. 
""For me to share a bit and communicate how I have gone about this pregnancy and say it is possible to keep climbing in a safe way has been really important.
""It's frustrating that other women are getting this judgement and choosing to give up something that they love and are comfortable with because of the fear of judgement.
""It is such a sad position to be in - it is bullying."""	/sport/sport-climbing/61296364

Spain struck in Valencia after just two minutes from a penalty corner with Clara Ycart slotting home a slick drag flick.
Both sides had chances before Spain made it 2-0 early in the second half.
It came from another penalty corner with Alejandra Torres-Quevedo deflecting on the backhand into the roof of the net.
Ireland applied good pressure throughout the match, forcing Spain to play a lot inside their own half and regularly winning possession.  
However, the final pass was missing for the girls in green as they failed to find the Spanish net.

sports	McLaren: Andreas Seidl to leave position as team principal	"Andreas Seidl is to leave his position as McLaren team principal to head up Audi's nascent Formula 1 programme at the Alfa Romeo/Sauber team.  
46-year-old German will be replaced at McLaren by Italian Andrea Stella, executive racing director since 2019.
McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown described Stella as ""highly talented, experienced and respected"".
Stella starts his role with immediate effect. Seidl will begin his position at Sauber in January.
Seidl's role as chief executive will be to gradually improve the team's performance so Audi can make its debut in as competitive a shape as possible when its entry coincides with F1's new engine regulations.
Industry sources say he will oversee the entire Audi F1 programme, both car and engine, and will in time appoint a team principal to run day-to-day operations and report to him. The current Alfa Romeo/Sauber team principal Frederic Vasseur is moving to Ferrari.
Seidl had also been approached by Ferrari as a potential replacement for Mattia Binotto, but is said by insiders to have preferred to take on a position at Audi.
Seidl's move sees him return to a leading motorsport role within the Volkswagen Group - he was head of Porsche's successful endurance racing programme before joining McLaren.
He was also an engineer at the Sauber team when it was owned by BMW between 2006 and 2009.
Seidl said: ""This is a team with a rich history in Formula 1 and an organisation I know really well from my time working and living in Hinwil for four years.""
Lando Norrisexternal-link, who joined McLaren in 2019, tweeted it had been ""mega"" to work with Seidl and added: ""I've never seen our team looking as strong as it is now and some of that is credit to the work you've done.""
Audi announced in October that it was to take over Sauber for its debut in F1 in 2026.
In 2023, the Switzerland-based team will have its final year racing under the name of the Alfa Romeo brand, which has provided financial support since 2018.
utfit will continue to race as Sauber in 2024 and 2025, with Ferrari engines, as it gears up for Audi's official entry.
From 2015-17, Seidl led Porsche to three consecutive victories in the Le Mans 24 Hours and the drivers' and constructors' titles in the  World Endurance Championship, before joining McLaren after Porsche shut the programme down.
He has been instrumental in McLaren's revival from their all-time low at the end of 2018, when they ended the season with the slowest car on the grid. 
Since then, McLaren have established themselves as a leading team behind the big three, won their first race since 2012 at the Italian Grand Prix in 2021, and have expectations of making further progress after a new wind tunnel comes on stream in the middle of next year.
His departure will be seen as a blow to McLaren, as he has made a strong impression in F1, but Brown is confident Stella will be a capable replacement.
Brown said Seidl informed him earlier this year of his intention to leave McLaren for another team when his contract came to a conclusion at the end of 2025, and that the original intention had been to continue as things were until then. 
But when Vasseur's move to Ferrari became clear, Sauber owner Finn Rausing contacted him and they came to a deal to resolve the move immediately. 
Brown said: ""Andrea is a highly talented, experienced and respected member of our team with a strong track record of leadership and success in Formula 1.""
Stella will lead McLaren's technical and operational programme and he steps up to run the team after a long career as an engineering leader in F1.
He was at Ferrari from 2000 to 2014 as a race engineer, working with Michael Schumacher, Kimi Raikkonen and then Fernando Alonso.
When Alonso left Ferrari for McLaren at the end of 2014, Stella decided to go with him, first as head of race operations, then performance director in 2018 and racing director in 2019.
Since 2019, he has been one of the three leaders of the team under Seidl, along with technical director James Key and production director Piers Thynne.
Stella said he felt ""privileged"" by his new position, adding that he would be a ""hands-on kind of team principal"". 
Stella is a diffident character, and admitted on Tuesday that he had been ""reluctant"" until now to step into the spotlight and take on public-facing engagements and that he needed to reflect on this aspect of the role before accepting it.
""I just focused on my job,"" he said. ""That was my focus. So it needed a bit of thought but it is also about preparation and getting familiar and being honest."""	/sport/formula1/63954876

2023 season will be contested between the remaining 10 clubs.
""While we never gave up hope of finding a successful outcome, our hearts go out to everyone who is impacted by this sad news,"" said England Netball chief executive Fran Connolly.
""It has been exceptionally difficult to see the situation unfold at Wasps and a highly challenging time for all involved in Wasps Netball, particularly the staff and players,"" Connolly added.
""Our focus now is to give clarity and certainty to players and staff who are impacted, and support them to return to courts, albeit different courts, as soon as possible.""
Although parties have displayed interest in buying two-time champions Wasps, the Netball Super League and England Netball said that they had ""sadly concluded that no proposal could evidence, with sufficient certainty, an ability to deliver the full requirements of an NSL franchise in the time available"".
10-team 2023 season will get under way in February. An updated fixture list has been published, while the signing window has been reopened to allow Wasps players to be signed as training partners for other clubs.
It has been confirmed that all player pathway activity will be maintained through the England Netball operated Central Player Pathway Programme.
Andrew Sheridan, FRP Advisory's joint administrator for Wasps Holdings, said: ""Despite all of our best efforts and interest from a number of parties, it has regrettably not been possible to find a solution in the time available. 
""We know that this will be incredibly disappointing news for all involved with Wasps Netball and their supporters, and we will continue to provide all support to those employees of the club who have been affected by the administration."""	/sport/netball/63591772
sports	Eddie Butler: The remarkable life of the 'voice of rugby'	"Eddie Butler was a man of many talents and will be remembered by people for different reasons.
He was the player who won 16 caps for Wales and captained his country on six occasions before retiring from international rugby union aged 27.
He became a columnist and journalist who was not afraid to hold people to account; a broadcaster and commentator who soothed and informed with his rich prose and booming voice.
Butler could write and broadcast with gravity and depth but also with lightness and humour; his crafted montages were a genre in themselves, not only on rugby union or even sport. 
His final act for the BBC was a piece on the death of Queen Elizabeth II that he scripted and sent over from Peru, where he died in his sleep on a charity trek.
Not many people could have done that, but the extraordinary Eddie Butler could.
A gentle giant, brilliant broadcaster and a wonderful wordsmith.
Butler was born in Newport in 1957 and, when he was three, the family moved to Raglan, as his father was working in a nylon factory in Pontypool.
After attending Monmouth School, Butler had a gap year in Spain in 1975 just as Franco's dictatorship was coming to an end.
He studied French and Spanish at Fitzwilliam College in Cambridge University, where he was a triple Blue after playing three Varsity matches against Oxford University.
mattered little to the hard school of Pontypool RFC where he came under the tutelage of legendary coach Ray Prosser who nicknamed him 'Bamber' after the University Challenge host Bamber Gascoigne.
ublic schoolboy became accepted in the Pooler set-up that included the famed Pontypool front-row of Charlie Faulkner, Bobby Windsor and Graham Price.
Butler once quipped: ""It took me about five years before I was accepted and then they made me captain in the sixth. It takes a bit of time but they are a great bunch of lads.""
rly 1980s was a tough era for Welsh rugby after the success of the 1970s.
In an international career that lasted four years, Butler was 22 when he was handed his Wales debut in 1980 against France in a side which included Cardiff fly-half Gareth Davies.
After they had both retired Davies was head of sport at BBC Sport Wales when he brought Butler into his department.
Butler had already begun to carve a name as a rugby journalist with the Observer and Guardian newspapers as he started his media career.
""First of all he was a top-class player,"" said Davies.
""Eddie became club captain at Pontypool, he captained Wales and he was against the norm.
""His broadcasting career was also against the norm, because many people think they can be broadcasters, but Eddie truly was a one-off in terms of his command of the English language, it's what enabled him to be such a great professional. 
""That's how he is recognised worldwide now. Many people will not have been around when he played. It's almost a case of him being irreplaceable.""
Butler graduated to commentary after working alongside the legendary Bill McLaren as a pundit.
He commentated on Wales' 2005 Grand Slam which started with Gavin Henson kicking a match-winning penalty against England and finished with a famous win over Ireland.
Former Wales centre Tom Shanklin was an integral part of that squad who won a first Grand Slam in 27 years.
Shanklin recalled a magical line from Butler that referred to Henson who was famous for shaving his body.
""He was the voice of Welsh rugby,"" Shanklin told BBC Radio Five Live.
""He was a master of words. He has commentated on so many of the games I have played in. 
""I always remember the 2005 win over England when Gavin Henson kicked the match-winning penalty and it was the words after the kick was nailed through the posts, 'Shave away Gavin, shave away'.
""He was unbelievable and also during the 2005 Grand Slam game against Ireland. 
""Some of his greatest work was in that game and it was such an iconic moment for Wales. What better person to have commentating on that than Eddie.""
After Shanklin retired, he became a co-commentator under Butler's tutelage.
""When you start going into commentary there is no better person to learn off than Eddie,"" said Shanklin.
""He was brilliant in helping you out when you first started out. I got to know him personally over the last few years and what a lovely bloke he was.
""If you were co-commentating on a game and you saw Eddie was going to be first voice you knew you were in safe hands.
""I will always remember there would always be this massive hand coming across to silence me and he would keep that hand there until people could hear the crowd. 
""He would let the game breathe then he would open his hand and invite you in to the commentary.""
Butler's most famous co-commentators were former Wales fly-half Jonathan Davies and England hooker Brian Moore.
""He was a great professional and a great friend,"" said Moore.
""I am a lot more upset than I thought I was going to be and I can't account for the depth of feeling.
""It was strange in many ways because we did not work together that often. It was not like a whole football season, it was the Six Nations and a few other games per year.
""We did not spend that much time in each other's company and yet I felt, and I am sure he did, we were just incredibly close.
""I have struggled because I wished I had told him how much I rated him.""
Moore and Butler formed the iconic double act.
""It just worked and I don't know why particularly,"" added Moore.
""I only argued with Eddie when he was wrong and that's why we argued a lot!
""When people have often said we sounded like an old couple bickering that's because over many years you get to tolerate and compromise and a deep underlying affection which underpins everything else.
""So you can disagree without fear of offence or ruining your relationship. We once sat down and looked at how we could improve things and after a minute we said, 'Let's stop'.
""If we had gone down that route it would have been contrived. It hasn't been contrived and just been spontaneous so let's just leave it at that.""
Moore praised the manner in which Butler won over the viewers after replacing McLaren.
""I had immense respect for him,"" said Moore.
""People now are being very nice about Eddie but they used to be on Twitter during games giving him a hard time.
""I remember when I first worked with him the stick he would get because he was not Bill McLaren and he had to follow a genius in broadcasting.
""Gradually over the years people did give him the full credit he deserved and was recognised for the great talent he was.
""He had a lot harder job than I had. Commentary is a subjective matter and you can't please everyone but Eddie in the end went a long way to pleasing most people.
""If people listened with any objectivity, they had to understand he knew the subject, he loved the game, was a wonderful wordsmith and knew when not to speak. 
One of Butler's great strengths was putting people at ease. Gareth Lewis is a BBC presenter who often worked alongside Butler.
""I presented Sunday Scrum V in the week that another Welsh rugby and broadcasting icon passed away in 2007,"" said Lewis.
""Truth be told we were very nervous about holding it together, let alone doing Grav - Ray Gravell - justice.
""We were all croaky and a little ashen-faced as we came on air and I remember thinking, 'Thank God Eddie is on the sofa'.
""He used just 11 words to sum up a man who almost defied summing up: 'Ray Gravell was defined by Wales, but not confined by Wales'. 
""Having said that, having spared the rest of us the job, having set the tone for an entire programme, allowed us to do Grav proud. Oh for an Eddie to sum up Eddie.""
Lewis also ""refereed"" his verbal battle with former Wales captain Gareth Thomas in 2006 following the departure of head coach Mike Ruddock.
mas was live in the BBC Wales studio defending his squad over player power accusations, Butler was the investigative journalist probing away looking for the reasons why Ruddock left. 
rast made for some explosive Sunday night television.
""Although he was arguably best-known for the spoken word, he was also a true journalist - in the getting-to-the-truth sense,"" said Lewis.
""There've been many versions told of the infamous departure of Mike Ruddock back in 2006 and the even more infamous episode of Scrum V, which I presented, and in which Eddie went head-to-head with Wales captain Gareth Thomas.  
""Eddie had his 'sources' and there had been plenty of 'rumours' too (you need to watch the video to understand why those words are in inverted commas) but Eddie had been told things that week, as we all had, and he was determined to make sure the truth somehow got out.""
BBC rugby commentator Andrew Cotter is now an established voice on our screens who learned from Butler.
""When he was commentating on France he loved to roll those names off the tongue and doing it in that deep, Welsh baritone,"" said Cotter.
""He worked with Bill McLaren as his co-commentator and then took over as the lead commentator when Bill stepped aside.
""So for the last 20 years he's been the man calling those big moments and doing that with authority.""
Cotter says Butler reached an audience outside rugby.
""What a beautiful writer he was with those montages,"" he added.
""In particular I remember the 2012 Olympics and he wrote a series of beautiful montages.
""Writing for television is a very different thing, a particular skill, and his writing and delivery and that's what he was, a Welsh poet, ensured he was one of the great orators of sports broadcasting.
""Many other former sports people have talked about his rugby pedigree but that doesn't guarantee you to be a wonderful broadcaster.
""He, like Peter Alliss and Steve Cram, go from being top-end on the field and actually become wonderful broadcasters.
""He was a very generous person, but what people will remember is those moments in sport and that rich, Welsh voice delivering those moments.
""If you get a chance to listen to things Eddie wrote and delivered, I'd love to see some of those montages again from the 2012 Olympics and beyond. 
""He will simply be remembered as one of the finest voices we've ever had in sports broadcasting.""
His former BBC colleague Gareth Lewis admits Butler was unique.
""What stands out for me most about Eddie is he was ok with being the brightest in the room,"" said Lewis.
""He was ok with being intelligent. He did not play up to that image, that most of us have been guilty of at one time or another.
""He wore that intelligence and brightness so lightly. So inclusively. And much as Eddie didn't always need that many words, so some people do not need all their names. Grav, Benny, Eddie. We've been lucky to have known them all.""
Hard to believe he will not be commentating on another Welsh rugby season which starts this weekend in which Shanklin was due to commentate alongside Butler.
""The URC season is about to start this weekend and it is going to be so strange turning up at the start of a season and the main voice is not there,"" said Shanklin.
As one of his colleagues eloquently concluded, ""Eddie Butler always so perfectly paid tribute to the greats of the game, I hope he realised he was one of them."""	/sport/rugby-union/62919140

30-year-old cox had had two rounds of chemotherapy when she was named in the squad for Munich.
Frankie Allen, Giedre Rakauskaite, Ed Fuller and Ollie Stanhope defended their PR3 mixed coxed four title ahead of France and Germany.
""Today's been really emotional for me,"" a tearful Kennedy told BBC Sport.
""I'm really holding it together. I'm just really proud of the team. It's a lot for me to take but it's also a lot for them. They've picked me up every time.""
Britain finished the 2,000m course in 19.33 seconds clear of France in seven minutes 6.73 seconds.
Kennedy, who has won one Paralympic and two world titles, will now step away from the crew to continue her treatment.
She said leaving the squad for the rest of the season was ""a wrench"" that ""really hurts"", but that she remains focused on the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris.
""If there's anything motivating me to get better it's to come back and take this crew to Paris,"" she said.
""It's a privilege to have something I love so much to really drive me.""
Having claimed four gold medals, two silvers and a bronze on Saturday, Britain kicked off the final day of rowing with two early wins.
Following the PR3 victory, Imogen Grant and Emily Craig won lightweight women's doubles sculls gold.
women's eight - six of whom had already won medals in Munich - took silver after being passed by Romania in the final 500m.
Graeme Thomas finished fifth in the men's single sculls, the final race of the regatta.
Britain failed to win Olympic rowing gold for the first time in 41 years at the Tokyo Games in 2021, but appear renewed under new men's head coach Paul Stannard and women's head coach Andrew Randell.
""Coming into Andrew's programme and the culture he's brought to the women's squad... it's a completely different vibe,"" Craig said.
British Rowing director of performance Louise Kingsley said the European Championships were a ""stepping stone"" for September's World Championships in the Czech Republic.
""It's fantastic after the trials and tribulations of Tokyo to get back on the front foot and be standing on the podium,"" she said.

sports	Mark Allen: 'I did it for my life, not my snooker' - Antrim player on four-stone weight loss	"Northern Ireland snooker player Mark Allen has explained that he shed four stone over the summer more for the good of his health and his family than to improve his snooker.
36-year-old's significant weight loss was apparent as he advanced to the final of the British Open, which he lost 10-7 to Welshman Ryan Day.
""I did it for my life, not for my snooker,"" reflected the Antrim man.
""I just didn't feel healthy six months ago. It's definitely done me no harm.""
""If it helps my snooker too, then brilliant. That seems to have happened this week,"" added Allen who jumps from 14th to 10th in the world rankings.
Allen weighed 19 stone when he competed at the World Championship in Sheffield in May but a chatexternal-link with seven-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan helped him embrace a more healthy lifestyle in recent months.
x-time ranking event winner has also made good progress in putting many of his well-publicised personal problems behind him.
""Off the table I feel I've got my priorities a bit better now. I'm not there yet but things are much better off the table.
""I've kept myself healthier and I want to be around for my family and my daughter and see her growing up.
""It was just a snooker match I lost on Sunday. Things are going well for me in every other way.""
Allen showed impressive form in defeating former world champions Judd Trump and Mark Selby on his way to reaching the final in Milton Keynes but fell short against Day, who recovered from 7-6 down to take victory.
""I appreciate how tough it is to win tournaments. The really top players make it look easy but it's not so all credit to Ryan for getting over the line,"" said Allen.
""It's been a while since he did that in a big event but he closed it out great. 
""I have no complaints. I had my chances, I just didn't perform well enough.
""The standard of play in the first session in particular was really good and Ryan continued to play well after that, whereas I didn't.""
Allen's attention will now turn to the defence of his Northern Ireland Open title, that tournament taking place at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast from 16 to 23 October.

sports	Mountaineer welcomes plans to reopen Edinburgh's Radical Road	"World-renowned mountaineer Stephen Venables has welcomed plans to reopen a historic path in Edinburgh, saying he is not convinced of the seriousness of the rock fall risk.
68-year-old climbed cliffs on the Radical Road in Holyrood Park regularly before it was closed four years ago over safety concerns.
Now site managers are looking to make a U-turn on the decision.
It follows an outcry from several organisations.
rts next to the Palace of Holyroodhouse where members of the Royal family stay when they are in Edinburgh.
Radical Road runs along Salisbury Crags at Arthur's Seat, an extinct volcano that is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks.
It was closed in 2018 after 50 tonnes of rock fell from cliffs onto the path.
Many organisations including Ramblers Scotland, Edinburgh heritage watchdog the Cockburn Association, access group ScotWays, and Mountaineering Scotland have criticised the move.
Geologists and historians have also previously called for the path to be reopened due to the significance of the site.
Historic Environment Scotland manages the city centre park, including the kilometre-long path set high in the volcanic rock of Salisbury Crags.
It is now saying it is looking into ways to reopen the site, which had been feared would be closed permanently.
Mr Venables, who lives in Edinburgh but has climbed all over the world, told BBC Scotland a few signs warning people of the dangers was all that was needed at the path.
He said: ""I have seen this happening more and more all over the world. Well-meaning officials love to restrict people's access.
""This creeping health and safety is a global problem. I'm not convinced of the seriousness of the risk of rockfall at this site.""
Mr Venables, who in 1988 became the first Briton to ascend the summit of Mount Everest without bottled oxygen, added that it had been a great shame when the path and cliffs were closed.
mountaineer said: ""Edinburgh is almost unique in having a mountain in its city centre, and some of the world's finest mountaineers first learned their craft here on Salisbury Crags.  
""I am always highly sceptical of 'health and safety' concerns overriding the public's need to access wild country, so I am delighted to hear that Radical Road may soon be re-opened.""
Radical Road is where the founding father of geology, James Hutton, arrived at his theory of how and when the world was formed.
In the late 18th Century he found proof for his theory that the world's landscape had evolved over time, in a spot known as Hutton's Section.
road got its name in the aftermath of the Radical War of 1820.
Also known as the Scottish Insurrection, this uprising was the result of social unrest among workers who were fed up with what they perceived to be unjust working and living conditions.
Unemployed west of Scotland weavers paved the track round Salisbury Crags, in a plan which was suggested by author Sir Walter Scott.
Brendan Paddy, Ramblers Scotland director, said: ""It is encouraging to hear suggestions that the 200-year-old Radical Road may reopen.
""The iconic path offers spectacular views of our capital city and is one of the most popular ways up Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh's top attraction on TripAdvisor. 
""Quite simply, Historic Environment Scotland must stop managing this world-famous geological feature like it would a crumbling historic building.
""Walkers should be advised of the risks then be allowed to make their own informed decisions, just as they do everywhere else in Scotland.""
James Garry, the assistant director of the Cockburn Association, said he was delighted plans were being looked into to reopen the road.
He said: ""This is the most popular and traditional access through the King's Park in Holyrood.
""It is the unique experience the path provides that makes it crucial that it is reopened and accessible.""
Richard Barron, chief operating officer of ScotWays - the oldest recreational access organisation in the world, said: ""To reopen the Radical Road would be of great relief.
""Closing this path for good could be the thin end of the wedge for other paths, which would be a travesty.""
Stuart Younie, Mountaineering Scotland CEO, said: ""There is a long history of climbing on the crags as the bouldering routes there are easily accessible, and climbers are already used to managing the risks associated with climbing on natural rock.""  
A spokeswoman for Historic Environment Scotland said: ""We hope to strike a balance between the current risk from rockfall and access that will provide benefit for all whilst meeting our statutory obligations, and we will continue to explore how we can minimise the current access restrictions on the Radical Road as part of any future proposals.
""We are reviewing how we assess and manage rock risk safety with specialists from the British Geological Survey and our specialist geotechnical engineers."""	/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-63743228

technology	How science is making chocolate taste even better	"Luisa Vicinanza-Bedi is an artisan chocolate maker in Nottingham and founder of Luisa's Vegan Chocolates.
""I've always had a love for chocolate, but when I discovered all the tastes and nuances of single-origin chocolate - the incredible flavour notes, like a fine wine - my eyes were opened,"" she says.
Much of the chocolate we eat will be made from cocoa blended from a number of farms, areas, or even countries.
But Ms Vicinanza-Bedi argues that using a single bean variety, from a single farm, gives the chocolate a unique flavour.
""We trade directly with our farmers and quality check the beans,"" she says. ""We do a cut test, weight test, moisture analysis, aroma test and pilot line taste.""
""If you think about wine or coffee, it's the same. The flavours come from the terrain, climate and soils from different parts of the world. They all taste mind-blowingly different.""
Scientists are trying to analyse where those special flavours come from, so they can be reproduced more consistently.
Prof Irene Chetschik heads up the Research Group for Food Chemistry at Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). 
She is developing new technological processes that can impact cocoa flavour on a molecular level - to get the best out of each harvest and create consistent quality.
""Now there is more appreciation for the product - we know where the bean is coming from, which farm, which variety - we can experience a much wider flavour diversity,"" she says.
raditionally, cocoa beans are fermented on the farm where they were grown.
re harvested and split. The pulp-covered beans are piled or stored in baskets, covered with banana or plantain leaves, and left to heat up in the sun. 
Microbes present in the environment degrade the pulp surrounding the beans. 
Next, the beans are dried, spread out on mats in the sun. 
""Fermentation results in a lot of quality differences. Not every fermentation works out well,"" says Prof Chetschik.
Poorly fermented cocoa beans develop little flavour, while over-fermented beans produce an acidic taste. 
""Moist incubation"" is a new fermenting technique, developed by Prof Chetschik and her team, in which cocoa beans are dried, then a lactic acid solution containing ethanol is applied. 
""This triggers the same reactions within the beans, but is far easier to control,"" she says.
resulting taste, she says, is sweeter, richer and fruitier.
Johannes Ansgar Schlüter, PhD student at ZHAW, adds: ""The process provides a way to control key flavour attributes of cocoa. At the same time, undesirable aroma components are not formed to the same extent as during traditional fermentations.""
Better understanding of the fermentation process could help struggling farmers. 
About 95% of cocoa is grown on small, family-run farms, employing around six million cocoa farmers worldwide. With low yield and little power, increasing profits in the sector do not reach cocoa farmers and many farmers live in chronic poverty.
""The cocoa value chain remains unequally divided,"" says Joke Aerts, from Dutch bean-to-bar chocolate company, Tony's Chocolonely. 
""A few big companies make huge profits, while millions of smallholder cocoa farmers are underpaid.""
rives demand for cheap labour and exploitation.
""It has been over 20 years since the big chocolate companies pledged to eliminate child labour in cocoa but not much has changed,"" says Ms Aerts. ""The prioritisation of company profits over human rights needs to stop now.""
Cocoa farmers are susceptible to changing weather patterns too. 
According to Fairtrade International, land suitable for cocoa production will decrease significantly in the near future, as a result of climate change. 
Experts say understanding the fermentation process is also vital when it comes to considering the impact of climate change on the business. 
""[We get] a lot of rain, a lot of humidity. It is not good for the plantations,"" says cocoa farmer Carmen Magali Eraso Adarme.
Ms Adarme's cocoa plantation in Huila, Colombia, is set on extremely steep land. Access is difficult and dangerous, especially when carrying heavy sacks of beans on their backs.
Ms Adarme is working with Luisa's Vegan Chocolates and Nottingham University on a project that aims to get a better flavour - and price - from their beans. 
Using hand-held DNA sequencing devices, researchers and farmers can analyse the microbes fermenting Ms Adarme's cocoa beans. 
With improved understanding of what drives the taste of premium chocolate, fermentation can be manipulated for improved flavour.
Ms Vicinanza-Bedi says: ""We have used DNA sequencing to confirm exactly what is a 'good flavour' of a cocoa bean. Then, using this data, we teach farmers what they can do to maximise their cocoa for the premium market.""
Ms Adarme's harvested beans were shipped to Luisa's Vegan Chocolates, where they were made into single origin bars. 
resulting increase in profits has allowed Ms Adarme to send her son to college and for her to learn English. Next, she hopes to improve the transportation part of the business - making her work easier and safer. 
Dr David Goupaulchan, international research fellow at the University of Nottingham, says: ""Growing cocoa is a very risky business. Yields can vary greatly from year-to-year depending on weather conditions, pests and diseases.""
More technology of business:
Dr Goupaulchan has been studying the microbes present during fermentation, how the environment affects their growth dynamics, and the role they play in flavour development. His research will be highlighted in the Royal Society Summer Exhibition later this year.
""The fermentation process has a huge impact on cocoa quality and taste,"" he explains. ""However, these processes are still very uncontrolled. This results in wide variability in quality between farms.""
A better understanding of the process, he explains, would result in better chocolates for consumers and better prices for farmers.
""My hope is that we can use science to modernise and rejuvenate the cocoa industry, and to create sustainable livelihoods for all,"" he says.
Back in Switzerland Prof Chetschik aims to get the best out of the raw material, so that after fermentation the cocoa needs less processing or any additives.
""Cocoa is extremely flavourful. There are so many flavour-active molecules, there is no need at all to add anything,"" she says."	/news/business-61511456

On Downdetector, an outage tracking website, users posted reports of problems between 07:00 and 09:00 BST.
Many reacted to the glitch with memes mocking Facebook. 
Meta, Facebook's parent company, apologised ""for any inconvenience"" and said the issue was resolved.
A spokesperson told the BBC, ""Earlier today, a configuration change caused some people to have trouble with their Facebook feed. We resolved the issue as quickly as possible for everyone who was impacted.""
A total of 81% of the reports received by Downdetector flagged issues with Facebook feeds, with the rest specifically highlighting the app or website. 
Users opening Facebook on mobile and desktop were met with chronological posts to celebrity pages and groups. 
Some posted memes to popular Facebook fan pages, such as those for Kim Kardashian, the Rolling Stones and Taylor Swift, to make fun of Facebook's spam-like error. Others also used the opportunity to promote GoFundMe and PayPal fundraisers. 
Concerns over the unavailability of content posted by friends and family, usually present for users at the top of their main feed, caused many to wonder whether Facebook had been hacked or flooded with spam.
Facebook outage fears have become more common since WhatsApp and other apps run by Meta stopped working for six hours last October.

technology	Missing Cryptoqueen: Is Dr Ruja Ignatova the biggest Bitcoin holder?	"With crypto markets in turmoil, files seen by the BBC suggest an unlikely Bitcoin investor may have also lost a fortune -  ""the missing cryptoqueen"", Dr Ruja Ignatova. 
mmer disappeared in 2017 as her cryptocurrency OneCoin was at its height - attracting billions from investors. Fraud and money-laundering charges in the US have led to her becoming one of the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives.
Oxford-educated entrepreneur told investors she had created the ""Bitcoin killer"", but the files suggest she secretly amassed billions in her rival currency before she disappeared.
Details first surfaced in 2021 in leaked documents from Dubai's courts, posted online by a lawyer who crowned Dr Ruja - as she's known - the ""most successful criminal in history"".
A new book and upcoming episodes of BBC podcast The Missing Cryptoqueen investigate how Dr Ruja has stayed hidden - and whether this alleged crypto-hoard might help explain it.
We have been able to independently verify some - but not all - of the information in the Dubai files. 
At the very least, the leak suggests Dubai was an important financial route for Dr Ruja, something the FBI alluded to in naming the United Arab Emirates as one of five countries she has known connections to.
""You've got hundreds of millions of dollars at stake here,"" said Dr Jonathan Levy, the lawyer who first posted the files online, and who is relying on information from them in a compensation claim for OneCoin victims.
m was lodged with the Supreme Court of the British Indian Ocean Territory, chosen because it hosted a web domain allegedly used by OneCoin.  
Dr Levy received thousands of documents, mostly in Arabic, from a whistleblower who he said thought it was wrong that people were being ""unjustly enriched"" in Dubai.
most tantalising claim made in Dr Levy's legal case is that a massive Bitcoin deal was struck with an Emirati royal, Sheikh Saoud bin Faisal Al Qassimi, the son of a wealthy business tycoon.
files further suggest that in 2015, Sheikh Saoud gave Dr Ruja four USB memory sticks containing 230,000 bitcoin - worth €48.5m at the time. 
In return, Dr Ruja handed over three cheques to Sheikh Saoud from Mashreq Bank, totalling around 210m Emirati dirhams, roughly €50m.
Prior to the alleged deal, Dubai's Mashreq Bank had begun closing Dr Ruja's accounts amid money-laundering concerns, so the cheques were unable to be cashed. 
In 2020, the Dubai authorities unfroze Dr Ruja's funds, despite the fact that more than a year earlier the US Department of Justice had published an indictment for her, labelling OneCoin a ""fraudulent cryptocurrency"". 
Months before the decision, Dr Ruja's former fund manager Mark Scott was also found guilty in New York of laundering $400m in OneCoin proceeds. 
Asked by the BBC about the decision, Dubai's Public Prosecutor did not respond.
According to Dubai Court of Appeal records, on 28 April 2022, Sheikh Saoud was seeking to have Dr Ruja's funds handed to him - suggesting a deal of some kind did originally take place between the pair. Dr Ruja herself is named as a respondent, despite not being seen in public for nearly five years. 
Little is known about Sheikh Saoud, but sources tell us the stocky body-building enthusiast is rarely seen in public.
He features in a 2017 YouTube video for an organisation called the Intergovernmental Collaborative Action Fund for Excellence (ICAFE) which claims to support education initiatives, but after the Dubai files were released, references to Sheikh Al Qassimi as ICAFE's ""Secretary-General"" disappeared from its website. 
A recently launched cryptocurrency also lists the sheikh as its chairman. The Dubai files appear to show a once close relationship between the Al Qassimi family and Dr Ruja.
On 3 September 2015, Dubai's Mashreq Bank wrote to Dr Ruja to explain that it would be closing her personal accounts.
Eleven days later, an email admitted to a US court shows Dr Ruja writing to a OneCoin colleague about moving €50m out of Mashreq Bank. She mentions a meeting the following week with ""one of the Sheiks [sic] in Dubai"" where she would ""try to get something done for us"".
It is not known who Dr Ruja intended to meet or even if a meeting took place, but the files hint at one possible explanation. 
A photo from the files seemingly dated 8 October 2015 but taken at an unknown place, pictures Dr Ruja standing next to Sheikh Faisal, the father of Sheikh Saoud. 
Al Qassimi family rules Sharjah, which borders Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah (RAK), the northernmost emirate. Sheikh Faisal did not respond to us about his family's relationship with Dr Ruja.
files also include a diplomatic ID, issued to Ruja as a ""special adviser"" to ICAFE - the organisation with which Sheikh Saoud once held a senior role.
rganisation appears to be connected to the United Nations, but a spokesman for the UN Secretary-General could not find any records of it being affiliated through normal routes. 
Co-founder Shariar Rahimi said ICAFE was ""registered"" with the UN, but failed to provide evidence of this. On Dr Ruja, he said any ICAFE documents provided to her came from Sheikh Saoud.
Some time after Dr Ruja's alleged Bitcoin deal, their relationship appears to have soured - one letter among the leaked files shows Sheikh Saoud dismissing Dr Ruja from a role as an ICAFE ambassador, before later becoming involved in a legal dispute over her assets.
ween the pair concluded in Dubai's Court of Appeal on 28 June.
Asked about the alleged Bitcoin deal, his relationship with Dr Ruja, and his role at ICAFE, Sheikh Saoud's lawyer did not directly respond, but wrote: ""All the information you have is baseless"".
ged Bitcoin transaction is said to have taken place using what's called cold-storage wallets, making it very difficult to ascertain if it actually happened. 
Bitcoin transactions can often be traced because all transfers of the virtual currency between wallets are recorded on a publicly viewable database. However, the court documents do not include any details about which - or how many - wallets these bitcoins were stored on.    
If she does still have them, Dr Ruja might find it difficult to move such a large amount of bitcoin. 
Crypto-author David Birch thinks Bitcoin's reputation as an ""anonymous"" currency is inaccurate because law enforcement agencies are increasingly using clever algorithms to track coins as they flow through the system.
""Getting rid of a few billion dollars' worth is much harder than you think,"" he said.
If Dr Ruja still has the 230,000 bitcoins, she would be one of the currency's largest holders. In November 2021, her stake would have peaked at nearly $15bn, but at the time of writing it has dropped to around $5bn, still more than enough to help her stay hidden.

technology	Tim Cook: 'No good excuse' for lack of women in tech	"Apple chief executive Tim Cook says there are still ""not enough women at the table"" at the world's tech firms - including his own.
In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Cook said technology ""will not achieve nearly what it could achieve"" without a more diverse workforce.
He said there were ""no good excuses"" for the lack of women in the sector.
He also said he thought Augmented Reality (AR), and the concept of the Metaverse, were ""profound.""
""In the future people will wonder how we lived without AR,"" he says. ""We're investing a tonne in that space."" 
Augmented Reality is a mixture of digital content and the real world - a very simple example might be using the phone on your camera to insert virtual furniture before you buy it, to see how it might look in your house.
metaverse is the concept of entire virtual worlds - and big tech is investing heavily in it, not least Meta, formerly Facebook, which re-branded itself to reflect its new priority.
I met Tim Cook during his first visit to the UK since the pandemic. 
In person, the boss of the world's richest company is affable, polite and thoughtful. 
He's softly spoken, and was dressed in his trademark dark clothes. He wasn't big on small talk, although we joked about the British weather, and he offered his condolences on the death of the Queen. 
Mr Cook told me he is ""not a great role model"" for work-life balance and that it isn't a phrase he associates with himself. 
""There's little distinction between personal and work, they blend,"" he says.He adds that he tries to ""compartmentalise"" issues that are outside of his control. ""I realise that they're there… but I don't obsess with it,"" he says.
He was fascinated by my BBC audio recorder and turned it over in his hands a few times once we had finished our interview.
I confessed that I'd had to ask his colleagues if I could borrow some wired headphones to plug into it - Apple largely ditched the headphone socket from its iPhones in 2016, in favour of wireless in-ear AirPods.
""Oh we still sell those,"" he said seriously of the wired pair hanging from my ears. ""People still buy them."" 
He was keen to talk to me about another subject close to his heart - diversity.
Apple has just launched its founders' development programme for female founders and app creators in the UK.
""I think the the essence of technology and its effect on humanity depends upon women being at the table,"" Mr Cook says.
""Technology's a great thing that will accomplish many things, but unless you have diverse views at the table that are working on it, you don't wind up with great solutions.""
He said while companies including his own had made progress on diversity, there were ""no good excuses"" for the tech sector not to employ more women.
Apple had 35% female staff across its global staff in 2021, according to its own diversity figures.
It launched its original Apple Health Kit in 2014 without a period tracker - which led to accusations that this was an oversight due to male bias among its developers.
Deloitte Global estimate large global technology firms will reach nearly 33% overall female representation in their workforces in 2022 on average - with 25% occupying technical roles.
One challenge facing the sector is the lack of girls choosing to pursue science, tech, engineering and maths subjects at school.
""Businesses can't cop out and say 'there's not enough women taking computer science - therefore I can't hire enough',"" says Mr Cook.
""We have to fundamentally change the number of people that are taking computer science and programming.""
His view is that everybody should be required to take some sort of coding course by the time they finish school, in order to have a ""working knowledge"" of how coding works and how apps are created. 
Apple has also created its own programme language, Swift, along with content for learning how to use it. 
Mr Cook and I also met a small group of female app founders, three of whom have joined Apple's new programme.
One of those is Alexia de Broglie, who created a personal finance education app called Your Juno, for women and non-binary people, after being shocked by how little her female friends understood about finance.
She said she belongs to some WhatsApp groups for founders, and that some of those are 90% male.
""[The women] all know each other on a first-name basis, which is crazy, because there are so many men that are building start-ups, and they definitely don't know each other.""
Ariana Alexander-Sefre runs Spoke, a wellness app aimed at young people, which she created after her younger brother lost a friend to suicide.
""I hope that in five years, that there's not even going be a thing of female founder, or there's not even going to be a defined niche because, you know, there will just be so many different people working on different things,"" she says.
""I'd love to see the whole playing field just equalised."""	/news/technology-63033078
technology	Twitter users jump to Mastodon - but what is it?	"In the wake of Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, some users have been seeking alternative platforms. One of the biggest beneficiaries has been Mastodon. But what is it?
work says it now has over 655,000 users - with over 230,000 having joined in the last week. 
On the surface Mastodon looks like Twitter - account users write posts (called ""toots""), which can be replied to, liked and re-posted, and they can follow each other.
Under the bonnet, though, it works in a different way.
's one of the reasons it is attracting fresh users, but it has caused some confusion to new people signing up.
form is six years old but its current activity is unprecedented and it is struggling under the weight of new joiners.
Here's a brief guide to finding your way around it.
first thing you have to do when you sign up is choose a server. There are loads of them, They are themed - many by country, city or interest - like UK, social, technology, gaming and so on.
It doesn't hugely matter which one you are on because you will be able to follow users on all the others anyway, but it does give you a starting community who are more likely to post things you are interested in as well.
Some of the popular ones - such as social and UK - are currently running very slowly because of demand.
Ryan Wild, who is running the MastodonApp.UK server via his firm Superior Networks, said he had over 6,000 new joiners in 24 hours and had to pause registration. 
""I wanted to see what the hype was about,"" he said.
""I stood the server up at 10pm Friday night, and I woke up next morning to 1,000 people I didn't know would rock up.""
rver you choose becomes part of your user name - so for example, I used my current Twitter handle, zsk, and chose the UK server, making my user name @zsk@mastodonapp.uk. And that's my address there - what you would look up to find me.
If you are on the same server, you can search just using the person's name, but if they are on a different server you will need their full address. 
Unlike Twitter, Mastodon won't suggest followers you may be interested in. 
You can also search hashtags.
Okay, this is complicated, but I'm going to try to keep it very simple.  
Mastodon is not one platform. It's not one ""thing"" and it is not owned by one person or firm. All of these different servers link together, and form a collective network, but they are owned by different people and organisations. 
ralised, and fans of decentralised platforms like them for exactly this reason - they can't be run at the whim of a single entity, bought or sold. 
However the downside of this is that you are instead at the whim of the person or organisation running your server - if they decide to abandon it, you lose your account. Mastodon is asking server owners to give their users three months notice if they decide to close it.
riginal founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, is working on a new network called BlueSky, by the way - and he has said he wants that to be decentralised too.
real hot potato. At the moment all the servers have their own moderation rules, and some have none. Some servers are choosing not to link to others that are full of bots or seem to have a high quantity of hateful content - this means they will not be visible to those on the servers where they are blocked. Posts can also be reported to the server owners.
If it's hate speech or illegal content then those owners can delete it - but that does not necessarily delete it everywhere. 
It's going to be a huge issue if this platform continues to grow.
re are already reports of people being targeted by hateful content and the BBC has seen examples of homophobic abuse.
No. There are no ads although there's also nothing to stop you writing a post promoting your company or product. 
Mastodon also doesn't offer a curated experience like Twitter does in terms of how you view posts - you generally see what your followers are saying, as they say it. 
It depends which server you are on - some are asking for donations, as they don't get paid, but it is largely free.

Adrian Scarlett, 52, said he always struggled with his weight but his young children gave him a ""wake-up call"".
father-of-three has dropped more than 10 stone (64kg) through diet, determination and dancing on the platform under the name Bye Bye Fatman.
Mr Scarlett's videos have had millions of views and now he wants to help others lose weight too.
""I've had a binge-eating disorder throughout my adult life,"" he said. 
""Any time I have been under stress, food has been the comfort.""
He said he ""changed his mindset"" after getting married and raising his children aged six, three and 20 months.
Mr Scarlett, a teacher at a school in Hereford, said meal replacement shakes helped him to shift the first few stones, which he continued with healthy eating and exercise.
""My children were my wake-up call,"" Mr Scarlett said.
""If I don't get healthy now, what are the chances I will be there to support them as they grow up? I had to do something.""
He documented his journey through a number of dance videos to trending songs on TikTok using his @Bye_Bye_Fatman profile.
It has attracted about 52,000 followers and more than 3.1m likes.
""As the audiences increase, I am now held accountable by more and more people and it is impossible to fail because I have people watching me,"" he said.
Mr Scarlett continued: ""I've not set myself a target because I feel that adds extra pressure so I chip away a couple of pounds each week.
He said he will continue on his weight loss journey and continue to encourage others to do the same.

technology	The crash dummy aimed at protecting women drivers	"Dr Astrid Linder is leading the development of the first dummy modelled on the average woman
Since the 1970s, crash test dummies - mechanical surrogates of the human body - have been used to determine car safety.
gy is used to estimate the effectiveness of seatbelts and safety features in new vehicle designs.
Until now the most commonly used dummy has been based on the average male build and weight.
However, women represent about half of all drivers and are more prone to injury in like-for-like accidents.
ummy that is sometimes used as a proxy for women is a scaled-down version of the male one, roughly the size of a 12-year-old girl. 
At 149cm tall (4ft 8ins) and weighing 48kg (7st 5lb), it represents the smallest 5% of women by the standards of the mid-1970s. 
However, a team of Swedish engineers has finally developed the first dummy, or to use the more technical term - seat evaluation tool - designed on the body of the average woman. 
r dummy is 162cm (5ft 3ins) tall and weighs 62kg (9st 7lbs), more representative of the female population.
So why have safety regulators not asked for it before now? 
""You can see that this is a bias,"" said Tjark Kreuzinger, who specialises in the field for Toyota in Europe. ""When all the men in the meetings decide, they tend to look to their feet and say 'this is it'. 
""I would never say that anybody does it intentionally but it's just the mere fact that it's typically a male decision - and that's why we do not have [average] female dummies.""
Several times a day in a lab in the Swedish city of Linköping, road accidents are simulated and the consequences are analysed. The sensors and transducers within the dummy provide potentially lifesaving data, measuring the precise physical forces exerted on each body part in a crash event.
m record data including velocity of impact, crushing force, bending, torque of the body and braking rates.
re focused on seeing what happens to the biomechanics of the dummy during low-impact rear collisions.
When a woman is in a car crash she is up to three times more likely to suffer whiplash injuries in rear impacts in comparison with a man, according to US government data. Although whiplash is not usually fatal, it can lead to physical disabilities - some of which can be permanent. 
It is these statistics that drive Astrid Linder, the director of traffic safety at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute, who is leading the research in Linköping. 
""We know from injury statistics that if we look at low severity impacts females are at higher risk.
""So, in order to ensure that you identify the seats that have the best protection for both parts of the population, we definitely need to have the part of the population at highest risk represented,"" she told the BBC.
Dr Linder believes her research can help shape the way cars are specified in the future and she stresses the key differences between men and women. Females are shorter and lighter than males, on average, and they have different muscle strengths.
Because of this they physically respond differently in a car crash. 
""We have differences in the shape of the torso and the centre of gravity and the outline of our hips and pelvis,"" she explained. 
But Dr Linder will still need regulators to enforce the use of the average female she has developed. 
Currently there is no legal requirement for car safety tests for rear impact collisions to be carried out on anything other than the average man.
Although some car companies are already using them in their own safety tests they are not yet used in EU or US regulatory tests.  
Engineers are starting to create more diverse dummies, including dummies that represent babies, elderly and overweight people.
rage female dummy in Linköping has a fully flexible spine, which means the team can look at what happens to the whole spine, from the head to the lower back, when a woman is injured.  
US company Humanetics is the largest manufacturer of crash test dummies worldwide and is seen as the leading voice when it comes to the precision of the technology. 
CEO Christopher O'Connor told the BBC he believes that safety has ""advanced significantly over the last 20, 30, 40 years"" but it ""really hasn't taken into account the differences between a male and a female"".
""You can't have the same device to test a man and a woman. We're not going to crack the injuries we are seeing today unless we put sensors there to measure those injuries. 
""By measuring those injuries we can then have safer cars with safer airbags, with safer seatbelts, with safer occupant compartments that allow for different sizes.""
UN is examining its regulations on crash testing and will determine whether they need to be changed to better protect all drivers.  
If changes are made to involve a crash test dummy representing the average female, there is an expectation that women will one day be safer behind the wheel.
""My hope for the future is that the safety of vehicles will be assessed for both parts of the population,"" Dr Linder said. "	/news/technology-62877930

Gloucester City Council's services were hit on 20 December, after malware was sent to a council member by email.
At the time, the website's benefits, house sales and planning application sections were all affected.
Eight months on, Cllr Jeremy Hilton said the council needs to ""get its act together"". The council declined to comment on the latest issues.
Most of these issues have been fixed but the council is yet to restore its planning portal to how it was before the cyber attack.
It is currently not possible to view historic planning application details or submit comments through the online portal.
w current plans residents have to click on the relevant ward and find the application in a list. 
Liberal Democrat Cllr Hilton told the Local Democracy Reporting Service ""the planning portal must be fully restored as matter of urgency"".
He said: ""The public and councillors cannot read the written representations that have been sent in and they have to rely solely on the officer report, which is published a few days before the planning committee meets. This isn't good enough.""
Gloucester City Council's website says: ""It is not currently possible to view historic planning applications on our website and we are not able to email or post plans to customers.
""Please note that as a result of the cyber incident and the new processes we have put into place there may unfortunately be delays to our service.

technology	Bitcoin: Missing hard drive could fund Newport crypto hub	"James Howells has been trying to retrieve the hard drive for nine years
Almost 10 years ago James Howells threw away a hard drive during a clear out  - forgetting about the Bitcoin on it.
Now, with the Bitcoin worth an estimated £150m ($184m), he is planning to spend millions digging up a Newport landfill in a bid to find the lost hard drive.
If recovered Mr Howells said he would give 10% of the proceeds to turn the city into a crypto-currency hub.
But the council said excavating the site would pose an ecological risk.
Mr Howells, an IT engineer, accidentally threw away the hard drive in 2013 after mining 8,000 Bitcoins in the early stages of the currency's development.
Bitcoin fluctuates wildly in value - in January 2021, Mr Howells' was worth around £210m, but with a big crash coming earlier this year, it is now  worth significantly less.
Newport council, which owns the landfill site where Mr Howells believes the drive to be, has repeatedly denied him access to dig there, on the grounds of environmental and access concerns. 
Mr Howells has now pledged about 10% of the proceeds of the  hard drive, should it be recovered, to fund a range of crypto-based projects in the city. 
Any plan to search for the drive would require a huge manual task of digging through thousands of tonnes of compacted landfill that has been accumulated at the site for decades. 
But Mr Howells believes he now has the funding and expertise set up to do it in an effective and environmentally beneficial way for the site. 
""Digging up a landfill is a huge operation in itself,"" he said.
""The funding has been secured. We've brought on an AI specialist. Their technology can easily be retrained to search for a hard drive.
""We've also got an environmental team on board. We've basically got a well-rounded team of various experts, with various expertise, which, when we all come together, are capable of completing this task to a very high standard.""
Finding the hard drive, though, is just part of the monumental task. There is no guarantee that, if it is there, it is even in a recoverable state.
But if it is, then its owner is set for a major windfall, although the actual amount will depend on which direction the volatile cryptocurrency goes in. 
But it is likely to be many millions of pounds.
37-year-old, who has signed away some of the ownership of the coins as part of the funding process, said his donation to the city would be used to promote the use and understanding of cryptocurrency.
What is cryptocurrency and how does it work?
""We've got a whole list of incentives, of good cases we'd like to do for the community,"" he said.
""One of the things we'd like to do on the actual landfill site, once we've cleaned it up and recovered that land, is put up a power generation facility, maybe a couple of wind turbines.
""We'd like to set up a community-owned (Bitcoin) mining facility which is using that clean electricity to create Bitcoin for the people of Newport.""
Among his other plans are proposals to give £50 worth of Bitcoin to every person in the city and install crypto-based terminals in all shops. 
Newport council said it had repeatedly responded to Mr Howells requests for access to the site:
""We have statutory duties which we must carry out in managing the landfill site,"" a spokesman said.
""Part of this is managing the ecological risk to the site and the wider area. Mr. Howells' proposals pose significant ecological risk which we cannot accept, and indeed are prevented from considering, by the terms of our permit."""	/news/uk-wales-62381682
technology	Elon Musk subpoenas Twitter founder Jack Dorsey ahead of court battle	"Elon Musk has launched legal action to summon Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey to appear in court as part of his legal battle with the tech company. 
Mr Musk is seeking to end his $44bn deal for Twitter after alleging the firm failed to provide enough information on fake account numbers.
But the social media site is suing Mr Musk to try to force him to buy it.
will be heard in Delaware, US, in October unless both parties decide to settle outside of court beforehand.
witter hopes that a judge will order Mr Musk - who is the world's richest man - to complete the takeover at the agreed price of $54.20 per share.
But as part of the trial preparations, lawyers for Mr Musk have called on his friend, the former boss of Twitter Mr Dorsey, in the hope that he will help support the Tesla boss's argument that the social media company hasn't been honest about the volume of fake accounts on its platform.
A subpoena legal writ or document summons a person to attend court or orders the submission of evidence, as records or documents, before a court.
In July, the billionaire said he planned to walk away from his deal to buy Twitter, which prompted the company to sue him.
Mr Musk accused the company of withholding information about fake accounts, but Twitter argued that these were excuses to cover buyer's remorse. 
ued its own subpoenas to people who had planned to invest in the deal with Mr Musk.
Mr Dorsey stepped down as chief executive of Twitter in November last year and tweeted in support of Mr Musk when he announced his bid to buy the company in April, saying: ""Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.""
Last month, a US judge ruled that Twitter's lawsuit against Mr Musk should go to trial in October.
Earlier in August, Mr Musk sold another 7.92 million shares in Tesla, worth around $6.88bn (£5.7bn), stating that he needed the money in case he is forced to buy Twitter.
Mr Musk has countersued Twitter, claiming a third of visible Twitter accounts, assessed by his team, were fake. Using that figure the team estimated that a minimum of 10% of daily active users are bots.
But filings made by his legal team in his battle with Twitter have been questioned by leading bot researchers. 
witter says it estimates that fewer than 5% of its daily active users are bot accounts. "	/news/business-62641029
technology	Twitter to lose magic with blue tick fee, says ex exec	"Charging $8 (£7) a month for a Twitter blue tick and other bonus features will make the social-media platform lose its ""magic"", a former executive has said.
Currently, all users around the world had equal voices on the platform, former global communications head Brandon Borrman told BBC News.
But selling verification and higher visibility would ""stratify"" Twitter.
And he felt ""curious and worried"" about what the platform's new owner, Elon Musk, might do to drive revenue.
""If charging for the blue tick was the fairest way to do it, I think Twitter probably would have done it a while ago,"" Mr Borrman told BBC News.
And he questioned how Twitter could justify asking people to pay to stay on an ""equal playing field"" with other users.
In addition to the blue Verified badge, those who pay could have their tweets promoted more widely and see fewer adverts, Mr Musk has suggested. 
""It's great for people who have money and want to spend money on having their voice amplified,"" Brandon Borrman said. ""$8 might seem like nothing to a lot of people - but it's quite substantial for most people around the world.""
Mr Musk has tweeted of his plan: ""We need to pay the bills somehow.""
Regarded as influential, Twitter is where celebrities, politicians and world leaders share their views - and ordinary individuals can respond directly to them.
But the company has not made a profit in several years, while its core user base of about 300 million per month has remained fairly static.
And Mr Borrman acknowledged it needed to change in order to grow. 
Its core problem was many of those who tried it did not stay, he said.
""You have to convince them that they'll get something out of it that they don't already by seeing tweets embedded in newspapers and television coverage all over the world.""
Some Twitter users have been threatening to delete their accounts in protest at the new leadership. 
But Mr Borrman said there remained no credible alternative, despite smaller rival Mastadon claiming to have registered thousands of new accounts since Mr Musk's purchase was completed.
""They're just not consumer or user friendly,"" he said.
witter founder Jack Dorsey is working on a social-network concept called Bluesky - but little is known about when that might launch or what it might look like.
Mr Dorsey has also retained his stake in Twitter - worth about $1bn - and has been supportive of Mr Musk, describing him as ""the singular solution I trust"" to run the company.
Mr Borrman, who left Twitter in June 2021, after three and a half years, and now works at the not-for-profit web organisation Mozilla, said he was pleased to have gone before Mr Musk arrived on the scene.
Still in touch with friends and colleagues from the company, he said the atmosphere within its headquarters was now ""tense"". 
""Elon obviously has a particular way he likes to manage and approach things that's quite different from the way Twitter has been managed in the past,"" he said.
""There's a lot of people who are in 'wait-and-see' mode."" 
Unconfirmed reports suggest Mr Musk is considering firing thousands of staff.
witter was one of many companies ""probably bigger than they need to be right now"" thanks to a Silicon Valley mentality of attracting and retaining technology talent, Mr Borrman said.
""Tech moves in cycles that are radically different than oil and gas, automotive, other forms of manufacturing, so having that staff on hand can actually be very beneficial to you and accelerating your growth,"" he said.
""Twitter was in a pretty good position going into 2022.
""I was really excited to see what that team was going to do going forward. 
""It's disappointing that they weren't able to actually execute on what I think for was a pretty solid strategy."""	/news/technology-63495124

He admitted to being part of a Long Island-based network that ferried more than 100kg of drugs including cocaine between US states.
rge against the 31-year-old rapper, whose real name is Willie Junior Maxwell II, carries a mandatory five-year sentence.
He is currently in jail for breaking his bail conditions after being accused of threatening to kill a man.
rap Queen artist, who pleaded guilty to distributing and possessing cocaine, was first arrested at a stadium in New York in October 2021.
He was detained last year alongside five other members of the alleged trafficking ring.
re accused of transporting, distributing and selling more than 100kg (220lbs) of cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, and crack cocaine across state lines between June 2019 and June 2020. 
rapper's plea deal allows him to avoid a jury trial and potential life sentence.
He remains in custody to await sentencing.
A few weeks ago he was accused of flashing a gun and yelling ""Imma kill you and everybody you with"" during a FaceTime call in December 2021.
Prosecutors say it happened about two months after his arrest in the drugs case.
Under his bail terms, he had agreed not to violate any laws or possess a gun or other weapon.
Fetty Wap's debut single Trap Queen reached number two in the US in 2015.
It was also a Top 10 hit in the UK that year, and was nominated for two Grammy Awards.

technology	Second-hand tech booms as shoppers look for bargains	"""We're lucky, to be a family with two full-time working adults. Still, we're turning the thermostat down and putting extra jumpers on. We've switched to budget supermarkets to save money.""
Anna Cargan, 35, lives with her husband and three young children in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. She started saving for Christmas in January. 
""We've really noticed how expensive things have got this year. We're having to think about what we're spending more than ever before.""
Cargans are not alone.
According to research by consultancy firm PWC, 86% of UK adults are concerned about affording the necessities of day-to-day life. 
Meanwhile, 70% of UK adults are planning to spend less this festive period, with almost half planning to cut back on Christmas presents, according to a survey by Accenture.
One tactic Ms Cargan will use to save money this Christmas, is to buy second-hand tech.
""I've saved about £600 buying second-hand phones,"" she says. ""I don't want the latest model - as long as it's functional, I'm happy.""
She bought the phones from Music Magpie, which was founded in a garage in Stockport in 2007. Back then it sold second-hand CDs and DVDs. 
Five years later, it expanded into electronics. Now Music Magpie has two workshops in the UK and one in the US, where it refurbishes all sorts of unwanted electronics.
Sam Vesey, Music Magpie's chief sustainability officer, suggests not only buying second-hand to save money, but also selling old tech too, to fund this year's present buying.
""There are estimates that people have about £600 of unused tech,"" says Ms Vesey. ""That's about £16bn sitting in drawers nationwide.""
Now, with a growing number of companies offering pre-owned tech, buying second-hand, says Ms Vesey, no longer has the stigma it once had.
""We've seen an increase in demand for refurbished tech,"" she says. ""In the same way that we've always been happy to have a second-hand house or a second-hand car, that's now passing through to our technology. People are quite happy to say 'mine's refurbed'.""
According to the UN, e-waste, that's anything with a plug or a battery, is the world's fastest-growing domestic waste stream - fuelled by soaring consumption rates, short life cycles and limited options for repair. 
Its report says that in 2019 only about 17% of e-waste was collected and recycled.
Meanwhile, the International Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Forum estimates that in 2022, more than 5.3 billion mobile phones alone will be discarded.
Gold, silver, copper, platinum and other high-value, recoverable materials, valued at about £47bn, are dumped or burned year after year, rather than being collected for treatment and reuse.
More technology of business:
However, Ms Vesey believes it's a problem with a simple solution.
""The circular economy is at the heart of what we do - reducing e-waste while saving consumers money.""
Music Magpie refurbishes about 400,000 tech items every year.
""If you want to get tech as a Christmas present, think about refurbished. It's a good thing. It's sustainable - and you will save money.""
And from ice cream makers to headphones, there is a huge range of second-hand tech looking for a new home.
In 2014, Matt Gale established UK Gym Equipment with the sole aim of refurbishing commercial exercise machines.
""At the time, most of the large gym chains and council facilities would order brand new equipment, keeping it for just four to five years before upgrading. A huge amount was scrapped.""
UK Gym Equipment refurbishes and sells anything that you can find in a gym - treadmills, cross trainers, bikes, rowers and strength machines. 
Ultimately, says Mr Gale, refurbished means you're getting more for your money.
""One of the biggest selling points is longevity,"" he says. ""Refurbished commercial machines are often still in the market 15 to 20 years after manufacture. There's a consistent level of parts and service support that rarely exists with some of the cheaper high street machines.""
Many electronic devices are not designed with the intention of keeping them in use for a long time.
""The linear economy has been the dominant way since the industrial revolution,"" says Joe Isles, circle of design programme lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.
""Take phones, we have them on a contract for 18 months or two years. Then we're encouraged to move on to the next one.""
Unbelievable efforts, he says, are made to source materials, to put those materials together, to design the products and turn them into a device - but often very little thought is put into what happens next.
""Most of the materials we use we lose - after just one relatively short usage period. The economic loss of relinquishing all that, letting it end up in landfill, is eye-watering.""
And, it seems, the big tech companies are starting to realise this.
Vodafone has recently launched a refurbished phone range, offering a two-year warranty on  every pay-monthly  refurbished phone. 
Research carried out for Vodafone by OnePoll found, of the 2,000 people surveyed, 73% would consider buying a refurbished phone to save money. 
However, the research also highlighted peoples' concerns about buying second-hand tech, including worries about limited battery life, device longevity and data security - as well as a reluctance to use ""someone else's"" device.  
give customers peace of mind, Vodafone only offers handsets in ""great"" or ""pristine"" condition. 
Every phone has a 32-point visual and diagnostic check to ensure components, such as the screen, battery and camera, are fully functional. Each device is deep cleaned and securely data wiped. 
So, this year, while money is tight for so many families, perhaps buying and selling old tech is a way to help fund Christmas.
Back in Barrow-in-Furness, Anna Cargan says: ""It's more important than ever in a cost-of-living and climate crisis to reuse things as much as we can.
""I'd love to see a world where we all see second-hand as first choice."""	/news/business-63779342
technology	Molly Russell inquest: Pinterest executive admits site was not safe	"A senior executive at social media site Pinterest has said he is ""sorry"" for content viewed by a 14-year-old who took her own life after viewing it.
Judson Hoffman admitted at an inquest that when Molly Russell was viewing the content on the platform in 2017, the site was not safe.
Molly, from Harrow, north-west London, died in November 2017. 
Her father, Ian, earlier told North London Coroner's Court that social media was instrumental in her death.
Mr Hoffman, Pinterest's global head of community operations, said he was ""not able to answer"" how children could agree to potentially being exposed to content inappropriate for a child.
In the platform's terms of service, displayed to the court, users were asked to report ""bad stuff"" if they saw it on the site. The terms of service, from November 2016, said users might be exposed to material that was ""inappropriate to children"".
Russell family's barrister, Oliver Sanders KC, asked: ""Bearing in mind it might be children who are opening the account… when a user opens an account they have to agree there may be content that's inappropriate for a child. If the user is a child, how can they agree to that?""
""I'm sorry, I'm not able to answer that,"" Mr Hoffman said.
Mr Hoffman said he deeply regretted that Molly saw content relating to self-harm, suicide and depression on the platform.
He was taken through a number of images the company had sent to Molly via email before her death, with headings such as ""10 depression pins you might like"" and ""depression recovery, depressed girl and more pins trending on Pinterest"".
mails also contained images about which Mr Sanders asked Mr Hoffman if he believed they were ""safe for children to see"".
Mr Hoffman replied: ""So, I want to be careful here because of the guidance that we have seen.
""I will say that this is the type of content that we wouldn't like anyone spending a lot of time with.""
Mr Sanders said ""particularly children"" would find it ""very difficult… to make sense"" of the content, to which Mr Hoffman replied: ""Yes.""
urt heard how Pinterest used artificial intelligence and human moderators to hide or remove content related to self-harm and suicide, a system that was ""largely successful"" but users might still encounter such content.
Family barrister Mr Sanders suggested to Mr Hoffman the platform had ""chosen to take a risk"" when there was a ""no-risk option"" of not allowing children on Pinterest.
Mr Hoffman replied: ""I would say 'chosen an option other than absolutely no risk', I would not say 'risky option'… obviously our intention is to reduce the risk.""
ring was shown two streams of content Molly had seen on Pinterest, comparing the material she viewed earlier in her use of the platform and in the months closer to her death. 
While the earlier stream of content included a wide variety of content, the latter focused on depression, self-harm and suicide.
Asked by Mr Sanders if he agreed that the type of content had changed, Mr Hoffman said: ""I do and it's important to note, and I deeply regret that she was able to access some of the content shown.""
Mr Hoffman agreed the platform was not safe when Molly used it - and admits harmful content still ""likely exists"" on the site.
Mr Sanders asked: ""Pinterest accepts that its platform should be safe for children?""
Mr Hoffman replied: ""It should be safe for everyone on the platform.""
Mr Sanders continued: ""And it accepts that in 2017, when Molly was on it, it wasn't safe?""
Mr Hoffman replied: ""That's correct, there was content that should have been removed that was not removed.
""Content that violates our policies still likely exists on our platform. It's safe but imperfect and we strive every day to make it safer and safer.""
Coroner Andrew Walker asked: ""It's not as safe as it could be?""
Mr Hoffman replied: ""Yes, because it could be perfect.""
Earlier in the day, the inquest also heard how Molly tried to ask for help from celebrities.
Molly's father, Ian Russell, said his daughter had reached out for help on Twitter to personalities with thousands or even millions of followers, who would not even necessarily notice a tweet from someone like Molly.
He added: ""She was calling out to an empty void.""
One message, sent to US actress Lili Reinhart, which was read to the court, said: ""I can't take it any more. I need to reach out to someone, I just can't take it.""
Mr Russell, who previously told the inquest he was shocked that ""dark, graphic, harmful material"" was readily available to be seen by children online, questioned how Molly knew ""how to get into this state"" and he ""found it hard to believe that some of the most powerful global brands in the world"" could not find a way to help prevent such content reaching vulnerable people.

technology	Big Tech must deal with disinformation or face fines, says EU	"Large tech companies, such as Google and Meta, will have to take action on deepfakes and fake accounts - or risk facing huge fines.
Deepfakes are videos using a person's likeness to portray them doing something they never did. 
New EU regulation, supported by the Digital Services Act (DSA), will demand tech firms deal with these forms of disinformation on their platforms.
Firms may be fined up to 6% of their global turnover if they do not comply.
rengthened code aims to prevent profiting from disinformation and fake news on their platforms, as well as increasing transparency around political advertising and curbing the spread of 'new malicious behaviours' such as bots, fake accounts and deepfakes. 
Clubhouse, Google, Meta, TikTok, Twitter and Twitch are among the 33 signatories to the enhanced code and worked together to agree the new rules . 
Firms who have signed up to the code will be compelled to share more information with the EU - with all signatories required to provide initial reports on their implementation of the code by the start of 2023.
Platforms with more than 45 million monthly active users in the EU will have to report to the Commission every six months. 
Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, wrote on Twitter: ""Combating the spread of misinfo is a complex and evolving societal issue"". 
""We continue to invest heavily in teams and technology, and we look forward to more collaboration to address it together.""
A Twitter spokesperson said the company welcomed the updated code. 
""Through and beyond the Code, Twitter remains committed to tackling misinformation and disinformation as we continue to evaluate and evolve our approach in this ever-changing environment,"" a statement said.
Google did not respond to a request for comment. 
WATCH: The face-swapping software explained
Deepfakes have been identified as an emerging form of disinformation when used maliciously to target politicians, celebrities and everyday citizens. 
In recent years they have become increasingly associated with pornography, with faces of individuals mapped onto explicit sexual material.
Deepfakes expert Nina Schick says non-consensual pornographic deepfakes are the primary form of malicious deepfakery today - notably affecting well-known figures including Michelle Obama, Natalie Portman and Emma Watson. 
Concerns have also been raised about the use of deepfakes in political sphere, with fake videos of world leaders being shared online during the Russia-Ukraine war. 
""This new anti-disinformation Code comes at a time when Russia is weaponising disinformation as part of its military aggression against Ukraine,"" said Věra Jourová, European Commission vice-president for values and transparency, ""but also when we see attacks on democracy more broadly.""
""We now have very significant commitments to reduce the impact of disinformation online, and much more robust tools to measure how these are implemented across the EU in all countries and in all its languages.""
fficulty of telling deepfakes and real footage apart is likely to grow in coming years, says Ms Schick, citing the increased availability of tools and apps needed to develop malicious deepfakes. 
While deepfakes allow troublemakers to directly spread disinformation, their appearance more widely on online platforms is causing a climate of information uncertainty - which is open to further manipulation. 
For example, genuine footage could be dismissed as deepfakes by those seeking to avoid accountability. 
makes the challenge for citizens to recognise genuine content, and for regulators and platforms to take action on them, ever more difficult. 
""You have this kind of double-edged sword - anything can be faked and everything can be denied,"" Ms Schick says. 
In recent years, Big Tech companies have made efforts to detect and counter deepfakes on their platforms - with Meta and Microsoft among stakeholders launching the Deepfake Detection Challenge for AI researchers in 2019. 
But platforms ""too often use deepfakes as a fig leaf to cover for the fact that they are not doing enough on existing forms of disinformation"", Ms Schick says. 
""They aren't the most prevalent or malicious forms of disinformation; we have so many existing forms of disinformation that are already doing more harm.""
Under the revised EU code, accounts taking part in co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour, generating fake engagement, impersonation and bot-driven amplification will also need to be periodically reviewed by relevant tech firms. 
But Ms Schick adds deepfakes still have the potential to become ""the most potent form of disinformation"" online. 
""This technology will become more and more prevalent relatively quickly, so we need to be on the front foot,"" she says. 
DSA - agreed by the European Parliament and EU member states in April - is the EU's planned regulation for illegal content, goods and services online, based on the principle that things which are illegal offline should also be illegal online. 
Expected to come into force in 2024, the DSA will apply to all online services that operate in the EU, but with particular focus on what it calls Vlops (very large online platforms, such as Facebook and YouTube) and Vloses (very large online search engines, such as Google) - defined as services that have more than 45m users in the EU.
It will be the legal tool used to support the new code of practice on disinformation, in a bid to tackle fake news and falsified imagery online."	/news/technology-61817647
technology	India gambles on building a leading drone industry	"Newly qualified drone pilot Uddesh Pratim Nath is excited about the opportunities his new skills have opened up for him.
""Being certified has opened new avenues for me. I have been working with different industries like survey mapping, asset inspection, agriculture and many others,"" he says. 
Drones come in all shapes and sizes. The smaller ones typically have three of four rotors and can carry something small like a camera. The biggest, usually used by the military, look more like aeroplanes and can carry substantial payloads.
Mr Nath, 23, had been designing drones, but decided that being certified to fly them would bring more job satisfaction and financial rewards.
A five-day course was enough to get him started, and he's now flight-testing drones that will be used for mapping.
Next he wants to master flying heavier and more complicated models.
Mr Nath is reaping the benefits of a big push by the Indian government into the drone industry.
In February this year India banned the import of drones, except for those needed by the military or for research and development.
government wants to develop a home-grown industry that can design and assemble drones and make the components that go into their manufacture.
""Drones can be significant creators of employment and economic growth due to their versatility, and ease of use, especially in India's remote areas,"" says Amber Dubey, former joint secretary at the Ministry of Civil Aviation.
""Given its traditional strengths in innovation, information technology, frugal engineering and its huge domestic demand, India has the potential of becoming a global drone hub by 2030,"" he tells the BBC.
Over the next three years Mr Dubey sees as much as 50bn rupees (£550m; $630m) invested in the sector.
Neel Mehta is the co-founder of Asteria Aerospace, which has been building drones for 10 years. He welcomes the government's efforts to boost the sector. 
It has allowed his company to expand beyond building drones for the defence sector and move into new areas.
""Drone companies now have a clear growth roadmap, large order books and promising future trajectory. In India, we now have drones being used in real-world, impactful large-scale applications, while being economically viable,"" says Mr Mehta.
Currently drones do all sorts of jobs in India. Police use them for monitoring the traffic and border security forces use them to search for smugglers and traffickers. 
re also increasingly common in the farming sector, where they are used to monitor the health of crops and spray them with fertiliser and pesticides.
However, despite the excitement and investment around India's drone industry, even those in the sector advise caution.
""India has set a goal of being a hub of drones by 2030, but I think we should be cautious because we at present don't not have an ecosystem and technology initiatives in place,"" says Rajiv Kumar Narang, from the Drone Federation of India.
He says the industry needs a robust regulator that can oversee safety and help develop an air traffic control system for drones.
will be particularly important as the aircraft become larger, says Mr Narang.
""Initiatives have to come from the government. A single entity or a nodal ministry has to take this forward if we want to reach a goal of being the hub by 2030,"" he says.
India also lacks the network of firms needed to make all the components that go into making a drone. 
At the moment many parts, including batteries, motors and flight controllers are imported. But the government is confident an incentive scheme will help boost domestic firms.
""The components industry will take two to three years to build, since it traditionally works on low margin and high volumes,"" says Mr Dubey.
Despite those reservations, firms are confident there will be demand for drones and people to fly them.
Chirag Shara is the chief executive of Drone Destination, which has trained more than 800 pilots and instructors since the rules on drone use were first relaxed in August 2021.
He estimates that India will need up to 500,000 certified pilots over the next five years.
""With 5G around the corner, the drone technology will have the platform to unleash its full potential, especially for long-range, high-endurance operations,"" he says.
More technology of business:
Some companies are already using autonomous drones that use artificial intelligence (AI) to get to their destinations. Could that eliminate the need for drone pilots in the future?
It's not something that concerns newly certified pilot Uddesh Nath.
""Drones will always require a pilot or someone remotely controlling and monitoring them. Different drones require different handling and AI is not yet that advanced.
""Even if it learns to control itself, we cannot teach the drone to react in every situation,"" he says."	/news/business-62966802
technology	Ben Bradley: Twitter abuse ‘putting off future MPs'	"An MP found to have received the highest proportion of abusive tweets in a BBC survey, said fear of insults and violence put people off public service.
BBC analysed almost three million tweets where MPs were mentioned over a 12-week period earlier this year.
About 5%, were classed as toxic - being rude or unreasonable - with Mansfield MP Ben Bradley seeing the highest proportion of 13.5%.
Mr Bradley said threats and personal abuse marred an important job.
BBC Shared Data Unit found that overall former Prime Minister Boris Johnson received the most abusive tweets - almost 19,000, or 3.5%, of the total received. 
But when adjusted for proportionality, Mr Bradley received the most negative tweets, with 2.1% classed as ""severe"". 
He was mentioned in hundreds of toxic-rated tweets after arguing for the privatisation of Channel 4.
MP, who is also the leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, admitted there were a number of worrying aspects.
""It is frustrating because I can usually overlook people who are just sweary and angry because it doesn't mean a lot,"" he said.
""The ones I find the most upsetting are where people have made a real strong judgement about your character and what you are like having never met you, based on some Twitter things they have read that are often wrong.""
He added: ""The worst bit is I often have people say to me 'I wouldn't want to do your job because of all that stuff'.
""But being a Member of Parliament is a huge privilege and should be something that people want to do and aspire to.""
And he emphasised the abuse had real world impacts, which once included threats to kidnap his family.
""I don't think we are going to get out of this social environment where people are mean to each other from the privacy of their keyboard,"" he said.
""But where it does cross the line and what's really, really important is where we have colleagues - David Amess, Jo Cox - who have been killed off the back of that sort of hateful conversation.
""It can grow and grow and we need to make sure people are kept safe.""
BBC's Shared Data Unit used Perspective, a tool that uses artificial intelligence to spot toxic comments online.
Developed by Jigsaw, a research unit within Google, it defines a toxic comment as one which is ""rude, disrespectful or unreasonable"" and ""likely to make someone leave a conversation"".
Analysis also showed all 20 of the MPs receiving the highest proportion of toxic comments were not members of the cabinet or shadow cabinet.

technology	The staff shortage slowing down air cargo and bags	"When photos emerged of the largest cargo plane in the world reduced to a smouldering husk, at Hostomel airport in Ukraine, Dan Morgan-Evans recalled the many times his company had chartered it for urgent freight deliveries.
udes transporting personal protective equipment (PPE) and antigen tests during the pandemic - but also plastic Christmas trees, the group director of cargo at Air Charter Service explains.
In the run-up to Christmas shopping season in 2021, the Antonov An-225 Mirya made four flights from China to Ireland, conveying 130 tons of plastic Christmas trees on each trip. At the time, High Street retailers were under huge pressure to get products in to stores.
""Those were some of the last charters we did with it as a company,"" says Mr Morgan-Evans. ""It was madness.""
Air freight has always been viewed as the ultimate - and most expensive - option for people determined to transport goods quickly. 
Problems in the container shipping industry as a result of the pandemic have pushed more business towards air freight but it too is facing challenges.
According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the cargo handling industry lost thousands of workers during the pandemic. Consequently, there is now a ""severe shortage"" of skilled ground handlers to move goods. 
Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer at Xeneta, highlights the shortage as a key problem. 
""There is enough capacity in the air but there's not the capacity on the ground,"" he says, saying the present situation is something of a ""bottleneck"".
""Whether it's truck drivers, or people loading ships or planes, or people in warehousing, there seems to be a global issue of finding operational people at the lower end of the pay-scale,"" he adds. 
He suggests, some of these problems for the industry are self-inflicted, caused by persistently undervaluing cargo handling as a service and perpetuating a system where staff are low-paid.
Many cargo handling firms are tight-lipped about the situation. IAG Cargo recently announced its ""biggest ever recruitment drive"", with 500 roles available. However, a spokeswoman declined to comment on how the plan is going. 
Another company, dnata, is ""not immune from the staff challenges facing the industry"" but is ""relatively well placed"" to meet those challenges, a spokeswoman says. 
Whereas a spokesman for Swissport commented that the company is ""not experiencing staff shortages to the point that their cargo operations are affected"".
""In order to attract anyone to any particular business you need to provide attractive terms,"" says Peter Drummond, director of baggage at tech firm, Sita. 
Mr Drummond adds there is also a shortage of passenger baggage handlers at present. It takes time to recruit these workers and do the necessary security checks, he notes.
Rates of mishandling - when bags are left behind, or sent to the wrong destination - before they are, hopefully, reunited with their owners, were up in 2021 on 2020, according to Sita. 
umber of mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers rose to 4.35 from a low of 3.5. It remains below the rate of 5.6 recorded in 2019, however, and well below 2007's rate of 18.88.
While you're 4.5 times more likely to have your bags mishandled on an international flight, than a domestic one but the chances of it happening at all remain ""quite low"", argues Mr Drummond.
He also suggests that, while short-staffed, the aviation industry is investing more in technology, such as that offered by Sita, that automatically tracks bags as they move through airport systems.
re are other pressures on the sector, besides staffing at the moment. 
Jess Nitsche, a photographer and designer based in Southern California owns Aixela Studio, which sells photographic prints, decorative items and clothing online. 
Some of her products are printed in China and then shipped to the US but lead times have doubled, she says, adding, ""I am unsure if I will be able to keep my shop open in the next year.""
Ms Nitsche uses air freight when shipping her products overseas but says this has become far less reliable than domestic shipping. 
She has been advised that the delays are partly due to disinfection processes affecting shipments in some parts of the world. Chinese authorities have insisted that packages be disinfected, even though experts suggest that the risk of catching Covid-19 from post is very low.
Some businesses, who can afford it are opting to buy their own cargo planes, or chartering aircraft specially. 
Air Charter Service has seen a huge spike in business, says Mr Morgan-Evans, estimating that volumes were up around 400% in 2021.
Unlike some air freight options, chartering firms can and do push airports to ensure they have staff available to load and unload these premium flights when required, ensuring timely deliveries, says Mr Morgan-Evans.
More technology of business:
Helane Becker, a managing director at market analysts' Cowen, forecasts that, following an ""unprecedented"" situation, demand for logistics services will cool off in late 2022, versus last year. 
And while Mr Morgan-Evans hopes to see plenty of continuing appetite for chartered cargo services in the final quarter of the year, he concedes soaring inflation may reduce overall consumer demand.
Are people still prepared to pay high prices for certain products given increasing inflation, he wonders, adding, ""it's kind of wait-and-see, it could go one way, or another for us."""	/news/business-61808753
technology	Twitter-Musk takeover dispute heading for October trial	"A US judge has ordered that Twitter's lawsuit against Elon Musk go to trial in October, a blow to the world's richest man who had asked for a delay.
Mr Musk walked away from his $44bn (£36bn) bid to buy Twitter earlier in July, prompting the company to sue him.
witter hopes that the court will order Mr Musk to complete the takeover at the agreed price of $54.20 per share.
re has accused Twitter of withholding information about fake accounts. 
His legal team has called for the trial to be held early next year due to its complexities, but Twitter asked for a September date.
On Tuesday, a judge in the state of Delaware agreed with the company and said a delay to the trial would cast a ""cloud of uncertainty"".
""Delay threatens irreparable harm,"" Chancellor Kathaleen St Jude McCormick said. ""The longer the delay, the greater the risk.""
wsuit accused Mr Musk of a ""long list"" of violations ahead of the potential merger and argued that he had ""cast a pall"" over the company. 
At the hearing on Tuesday, Twitter's lead counsel William Savitt said the ongoing uncertainty about whether the takeover would go forward or not ""inflicts harm on Twitter everyday"". 
re is a theory that Musk still wants to buy Twitter, he's just trying to knock down the price. 
If that's the case, his lawyers are spectacularly good poker players. 
Mr Musk's legal team wanted this trial to happen next year. 
med they needed more time to dig through data on spam accounts. Clearly though this is also a stalling strategy. 
repeated Mr Musk's assertion that Twitter may have more fake accounts than it claims. 
ugely damaging accusation - and a strange thing to say if Mr Musk were still interested in purchasing the company at a lower price. 
witter's reputation has already taken a huge hit. Twitter's revenues are almost entirely based on ads. The fewer real people on the platform, the less money it can make. Bots don't have wallets. 
's why Twitter wants this process sorted quickly. By far the best case scenario for the company is that Mr Musk buys it for $54.20 a share - and that it happens as soon as possible.
's why this judgement is good news for Twitter. The judge sided with Twitter's lawyers - that a ruling needed to be reached quickly. 
It heaps more pressure on Mr Musk, who is faced with the bizarre prospect of having to buy a company he no longer wishes to acquire. 
However, in practice this will likely put more pressure on Mr Musk to settle, pay Twitter some money, and move on. 
""Musk has been and remains contractually obligated to use his best efforts to close the deal,"" Mr Savitt said. ""What he's doing is exactly the opposite. It's sabotage.""
A lawyer for Mr Musk, Andrew Rossman, argued that he remains one of Twitter's most significant shareholders. He said the case should go to trial next year on a ""sensible"" schedule that would give both sides time to prepare. 
Since Mr Musk began questioning the number of fake and spam accounts on Twitter's platform in May, the company has seen its share prices fall from highs of $50 per share. 
mpany's shares currently stand at about $39.45 - well below the $54.20 per share at which it hopes to close the merger. 
A self-described ""free speech absolutist"", Mr Musk has vowed to ease restrictions on content if the company were under his ownership. 
He has also called for the company to be more open about how it presents tweets to users and how tweets are promoted to larger audiences. "	/news/world-us-canada-62058387
technology	Can crumbling cookies sweeten UK data-protection plans?	"Would you like a cookie - or are you absolutely fed up of being asked?
When the government published its proposals for striking new data-protection plans in the UK, all eyes were on cookie consents - those annoying pop-ups that appear in the foreground on many websites, asking whether you will accept cookies, tiny bits of text that can be used to track things about you, including:
mpanies behind the sites use this information for a number of reasons - ad targeting being a huge one. 
But it also, they say, gives you a more bespoke version of the site.
If it knows you look at lots of technology news, it can serve you up more  - and less about gardening, for example.
If you choose not to enable cookies, it can mean the site has no other way of storing this choice, leaving you to opt out every visit.
But now, the government wants to limit these cookie consents - suggesting instead a one-stop data-privacy setting applied at browser level. 
Google tried something similar years ago, a ""Do not track,"" header - but it was not legally enforceable, users could not check to see whether sites were respecting it and it has largely been dropped. A note on the Mozilla developer pages advises against using it.
more privacy-focused technology giant Apple gives owners of its products regular reports about how many sites and apps are trying to track them. 
But like it or loathe it, tracking and data gathering has become the way in which a ""free-to-use"" web content is funded - by content providers who can turn it into advertising revenue.
Even for those who fundamentally disagree with cookies, it has become a wearying war of attrition. ""Yes, you can have my damn cookie!"" tweeted a despairing Elon Musk. 
Many critics say the pop-ups in their current form are pointless. A 2019 study found most cookies were ""not compliant with EU privacy law"".
But the TechUK trade association says there are ""outstanding questions"" around exactly how the UK's alternative would work, suggesting more consultation is needed.
And privacy campaigners the Open Rights Group are outraged it might involve opting out of tracking, rather than opting in, saying this wrongly places the onus on individuals preventing, rather than permitting, their online lives being monitored.
Data Reform Bill is an attempt to move away from what the government calls the ""red tape"" of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation - most of which has been adopted into British law.
GDPR puts enormous weight on protecting the privacy and data of individuals, with steep penalties for non-compliance, but cookie consent is not covered.
Data Reform Bill also proposes:
All this can be done without reducing Britain's data-protection ""gold standard"", the government says. It could save businesses £1bn over 10 years and remove ""box-ticking"" exercises.
Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries calls it ""cementing post-Brexit Britain's position as a science and tech superpower"".
But so far, reaction has been mixed, with industry broadly more supportive than privacy campaigners.
UK - which worked with the government on the proposals - calls them ""a welcome package"".
""The reforms... find a good balance between making the UK's data-protection system clearer, more flexible, and more user friendly to researchers, innovators, and smaller companies,"" chief executive Julian David says.
But the Open Rights Group calls the bill a ""bonfire"" of rights.
""At a time when personal data can be leveraged to do all sort of wrong things, depicting data protection as a burden is wrong, irresponsible and negligent,"" it said.
Meanwhile, the lawyers are looking at how the proposals may affect the passage of data between the UK and the EU.
Vinod Bange, of law firm Taylor Wessing, says his initial response was ""relief"" there was no entire rewrite of existing policy.
But he adds: ""The most impactful changes for UK organisations will be the unintended consequences, so changes that could derail the current data-flow adequacy with the EU will be the ones to watch."" 
Nothing is likely to change overnight - the bill first has to trundle its way through Parliament - but expect much more debate in the coming months.

technology	Fifa gamer meets best mates for first time at his wedding	"Would you invite four people you had never met to your wedding?
Well, that's exactly what Ryan George did. The 28-year-old from Cardiff had only spoken to Gerard, Scott, Kesean and Matt while playing football video game Fifa online, but wanted them to be there as he tied the knot.
Living across the UK, Ryan said it was the perfect chance to meet up for the first time and ""have a few pints"".
He said online friendships were often the ""most accessible"" and important for mental health.
Mental health charity Mind Cymru said gaming and online friendships could have a positive impact on a person's wellbeing if used responsibly.
Ryan has been gaming since he was 11 years old and the friends met in a ""pro club"" on Fifa, where strangers can connect and compete together.
r team is currently 44th in the world but it is not that easy to meet up for a kick about.
Gerard, who could not make the wedding in September as his wife had just had a baby, lives in Belfast, Kesean in London, and Scott and Matt in Cambridgeshire.
rted playing a few times a week, but Ryan said they became a lot closer during the Covid lockdowns, taking their chat outside of games and into group chats and video calls.
w share the most important parts of each other's lives including the birth of their children, so father-of-two Ryan said it was a ""no-brainer to invite the boys"", with support from wife Alice.
""We've grown up with the game so I suppose at heart we still think that we are 17, and playing the same game as we were back then,"" said Ryan.
""Me and the boys aren't really the type to be gaming all the time, we've all got lives outside of Xbox and friends and families so we weren't really looking for friends.
""But it was definitely organic and moving to group chats then became a tool for everyone to speak about other things and get a bit closer.""
He said the group were ""just talking absolute rubbish most of the time"", and gave each other ""a bit of stick"" about their different football teams.
""I don't think any of us really expected for it to get to that point we would be meeting up but we were all very invested in each other's lives,"" he added.
ggest shock when meeting his friends, Ryan said, was how tall they were.
""It didn't feel anxious or awkward because I guess we sort of considered that we knew each other already and had flirted with the idea of meeting up for a while,"" he said.
However, he did admit he was worried how people might react, and wife Alice was ""relieved to know they are real"".
He said a lot of people were ""pleasantly"" surprised by the boys who were ""very popular"" with other guests.
""I'm quite a sensible person. I wouldn't have invited them without knowing them so that is something that people definitely need to be cautious about.
""It's a relationship that has developed over a few years and we even had a virtual Fifa stag for me where we played drinking games and stuff.""
For Ryan, who said it can often be difficult for adult friends to meet up due to work and family commitments, gaming is ""probably the most accessible form really for me to be able to socialise"".
""If you are struggling, or you feel a little bit lonely you can log on and meet some new people and it's a great platform for that. There's loads of different games and the market's massive.
""It's a good way to go around things and definitely for me now with kids, it's something that I really do rely on to be able to chat people.
""You can get a good couple of hours of good social time, and also it can be decompressing.""
He said especially during lockdown, it was a ""release and a bit of normality"" and he knows they ""have each other's back"".
Scott, who made the trip from Cambridgeshire with childhood friend Matt, said the foursome speak every day, laughing and ""taking the mick of of each other"".
Scott has made friends through games before but ""never like this"", and said their relationship ""was so influential in lockdown"" and ""a stroke of luck"" that they were all able to get to know each other.
He said: ""When Ryan invited us we were never going to say no.
""It was a beautiful thing watching Ryan and Alice get married and I'm looking forward to next time.""
friends are planning to meet up next year in Belfast to see the band Blink182.
""I don't really like Blink182 but I am looking forward to the weekend away and finally meeting Gerard,"" said Scott.
While a recent study found gaming itself has little impact on wellbeing, Mind Cymru said the social aspect cannot be downplayed.
Stephen Buckley, from the charity, said: ""Playing games may positively impact our mental health by giving us time to relax, connect with others, or try out new life skills.
""They may also allow us to build a positive community, socialise and connect with others and this in turn could help us to talk about our feelings, especially if we're going through a difficult time. 
""Gaming may also give us time and space to relax, which is really important for our mental wellbeing.""
However, he said experiences do vary and it was ""crucial to look after ourselves when we're gaming"", and seek help if you experience feelings of isolation, low mood or spend money excessively.
""It's also important to think carefully about what you share online, even with people you feel that you know,"" he added."	/news/uk-wales-63244621
technology	Over a million are owed money by failed crypto exchange	"Over a million people and businesses could be owed money following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, according to bankruptcy filings.
re have also been reports that FTX suffered a hack, taking millions of dollars of crypto from the firm.
It's a worrying time for individuals who have money in the business.
In the UK, crypto assets are largely unregulated, and experts and financial watchdogs warn there's little protection for consumers. 
Despite strong warnings from watchdogs about the risk of crypto investments, around 6.7 million people in the UK own or have bought crypto assets - close to one-tenth of the population.
In September, financial watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned that FTX may be providing financial services or products in the UK without its authorisation. It said bluntly: ""You are unlikely to get your money back if things go wrong.""
It now has a page dealing with the FTX liquidation. Again, the message is that options for those who've invested in it are limited.
Asked about the collapse of the multi-billion dollar exchange, the Governor of the Bank of England said it did not pose risks to the wider economy.
""I don't… anywhere detect what I would call a systemic fallout from FTX,"" Andrew Bailey said, noting that its activity in the UK was ""not very substantial"".
He added that global regulators were ""doing a lot of work"" to improve oversight of crypto assets. 
""There is ownership of crypto-currency in this country, no doubt, I get asked about it particularly when I go to schools actually, interestingly,"" he said. 
""It is not something we can be relaxed about and let me reassure you we are not relaxed about it.""
re is at least a liquidation process in the case of FTX, which will divide up the remains of the firm among those to whom it owes money. 
And founder Sam Bankman-Fried claimed in a tweet that ""my goal—my one goal—is to do right by customers"". 
In many other cases there is not even a bankruptcy process.
Gavin Brown, Associate Professor in Financial Technology at the University of Liverpool, pointed to a recent report which suggested that ""42% of exchanges which failed simply disappeared without a trace"".
But the bankruptcy may not provide much comfort. 
Prof Brown told the BBC: ""In the event of exchange failure, or even bankruptcy, it is the investors who are on the hook for losses.""
He and other experts warned that often small investors will go to the back of the queue when what remains of a crypto business is divided up among creditors.
Experts doubt much money will be coming back. ""The unfortunate news is that the money's all gone. It's just not there any more. Investors should expect pennies on the dollar,"" said crypto blogger and author David Gerard.
Mr Gerard argued that in many of these failures there are ""real liabilities but imaginary assets"" and that a huge proportion of the assets are in exchanges' own tokens - such as FTX's FTT token -  to which ""they've assigned a spurious value in the billions"".
FCA says people worried about their finances should go to a government-backed organisation, Moneyhelper. But Moneyhelper is an advice service, and can only offer guidance on how to survive when your savings vanish.
With some mainstream investments it's possible to receive compensation if an institution collapses - for example a bank or building society - through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)
But the FSCS says it doesn't protect crypto assets, as they are not a regulated financial product in the UK - all it can do is warn consumers of the risks, and provide tools to check if their investment is protected by the scheme.
rganisation says crypto currency is something that consumers ask about every week, either via its customer service team, social media or searching for information on its website.
It says ""crypto"" is one of the most popular words searched for on its website.
Daniel Seely, financial services associate for law firm Freeths, told the BBC: ""The short answer is that there isn't much recourse available.""
With a few exceptions, crypto assets fall largely outside the scope of regulators and watchdogs - for example, the Financial Ombudsman Service - and so consumers ""don't have a clear right to recourse in the same way they may with other products"". 
Consumers, argued Mr Seely, could consider pursuing civil claims against parties involved in an investment, such as brokers or financial advisers if they were used, ""but realistically if it is just a case that the investments didn't go as planned, there is currently little they can do to recoup losses"".
Financial Services and Markets Bill currently being scrutinised by parliament will begin to bring in some additional regulation for crypto, but in the meantime Mr Seely said it remained a ""very risky area for consumers looking to invest"".
Haider Rafique - from OKX, a crypto exchange -  said there were some steps consumers could take to protect themselves against similar losses in the future, in particular by thinking carefully about where they stored their assets.
""Unless they are active traders, we encourage our customers to store their crypto currencies on a non-custodial decentralised wallet,""he said.
""In the industry we say: 'Not your keys, not your crypto.' Recent events prove it has never been truer.""
Benjamin Dean, director of WisdomTree Investments, an asset management firm, urged people to think about investments in blockchain-related technology the same way they would more conventional assets, like stocks, shares or gold.
""Do not invest more money than you can afford to lose, and never invest your money with companies which operate unregulated, off-shore exchanges"", he advised.
""If you do not research where you are investing your money, then you are running a very high risk of losing all your investment.""
Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy for consumer group Which? warned: ""Crypto assets are very high-risk and speculative. Investors face losing all their money if they decide to buy them, as they often come with limited consumer protections."""	/news/technology-63624894
technology	Bristol radio duo's new YouTube series brings musicians together	"A Bristol-based radio duo have begun a new series to promote artist development among musicians.
Presenters Daboothe & Maxx created a series on YouTube called CONNECT, which encourages collaboration between other artists.
Each series contains 10 episodes in which three artists are handpicked to work together for the first time.
""It allows artists to come together and network,"" says director and producer Maxx.
Inspired by cypher videos, a term which originates from the early days of hip-hop, musicians gather together to take it in turns to rap or sing different verses to the same beat.
""It was a challenging experience, but it was good,"" said KDogg, who enjoyed the energy and atmosphere of collaborating with other artists.
Instead of competing against each other, artists are encouraged to work together and form new connections.
Daboothe, who directs and produces the series alongside Maxx, says that connections can be vital in an artist's career.
""They can turn to the people they meet for collaboration and support,"" adds Daboothe.
f the CONNECT series was launched on 30 September and featured Bristol rappers Backsy, Delocx and KDoggKT.
During his eight years of making music, Delocx has previously worked with Daboothe & Maxx, describing them as a ""force that's needed in the industry"".
He said before them, ""there wasn't really anybody looking out for urban artists in Bristol"". 
""Everyone was looking for pop and indie music,"" Delocx said.
Grime artist Backsy feels he has benefitted from the exposure gained from the cypher series, while learning to work with other artists in a pressurised environment. 
""There's so many different sounds and talents coming out of Bristol that we're not really hearing anywhere else,"" he said.
radio duo present a show called In The Now, which is syndicated on multiple community radio stations across the UK, such as 1020, Subtle Radio and Ujima Radio.
Having hosted the show for two years, Daboothe & Maxx are passionate about creating an accessible exposure platform for emerging artists.

technology	Alex Belfield: The stalker who reported on his own trial	"Earlier this month, ex-BBC presenter Alex Belfield was jailed for stalking and harassment. His victims included former colleagues at the corporation, among them Radio 2's Jeremy Vine. One striking aspect of the case was that he was given leave by the judge to file social media updates reporting on his own trial. 
""Bear in mind, my audience on YouTube is bigger than GB News, Sky News and Talk TV put together.""
So said Belfield on his YouTube channel The Voice of Reason, in a video entitled ""BBC and police witch-hunt"". And while the broadcasters in question might dismiss his audience claims as exaggeration, there is little doubt he reached a lot of people.
On that post alone, Belfield, from Nottingham, attracted more than 183,000 views, 11,000 likes and nearly 2,000 comments.
most striking aspect of the video was that, even as Belfield was posting it, he was on trial accused of stalking eight people, including some of his former BBC colleagues.
urt heard that the 42-year-old had repeatedly exposed them to hatred as a result of his social media activity.
Each day, Belfield - who denied the charges - would appear before judge and jury, and later filmed himself outside the court or at home reporting on the progress of the case.
He would then upload his reports to the same social media channels the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he had continually used to harass his victims.
He was found guilty of four stalking offences and cleared of another four.
Belfield's YouTube channel has more than 350,000 subscribers. His court reports regularly attracted thousands of comments and more than 100,000 views.
""It was absolutely bizarre,"" said Jeremy Vine, one of the BBC stars Belfield was found guilty of targeting.
""He was essentially reporting on his own case - I have never heard of it happening before.
""You were watching your stalker read out your evidence online.""
Mr Vine believes many of the videos that led to Belfield's prosecution remain in circulation.
ker posted an update entitled ""Back soon"" on the day of his sentencing, on 16 September.
""He tells his followers to copy and share his content - you find the videos popping up all over the place,"" Mr Vine said.
""Social media companies have got to be liable for this bile.
""If you have somebody using YouTube as a factory of hate, you have got to be more receptive to complaints.""
fendant reporting on their own trial was, according to media lawyer Jonathan Coad, unprecedented.
""It's one of those weird, seismic changes of the 21st Century,"" he said.
""When I started practising law 30 years ago, the power of the individual to inflict their opinion on large numbers of people was restricted to a very small number of people.
""Then, of course, we started to have social media. I have clients with six or seven figure followings who can communicate, at the touch of a button, with more people than a national newspaper can.""
Mr Coad believes the judge in the case - Mr Justice Saini - would have had no choice other than to grant Belfield leave to file his reports - which totalled more than 30 updates and spanned the entire four weeks of the trial.
""You have a situation where we have a strong emphasis in our courts on open justice,"" he said.
""The judge will think 'I can't tell him he can't report on the hearings because that would be a flagrant contradiction of the whole essence of open justice'.
""How can you conceptually separate reporters tweeting from the court - which is allowed - and telling a defendant he can't comment on the whole trial from his YouTube channel?""
Mr Coad said he could foresee a situation where other defendants followed Belfield's lead - potentially causing great distress to victims along the way.
""We have opted for very little regulation in terms of media coverage of court cases - and that extends to Fleet Street,"" he said.
""It's bound to happen again. This will put ideas in people's heads - if somebody thinks 'I'm in court for four weeks, I might as well start a YouTube channel and make some money', it's a way of gaining some notoriety.""
BBC understands the prosecution did not oppose Belfield's reporting of the case.
Following conviction, the judge warned him he needed to be ""extra careful about...  online communications"".
For another legal expert, the case was more of a one-off, in which Belfield's credentials as a journalist were key in allowing him to file reports on the trial.
""Belfield's situation is fairly unique in that he's a reporter who is also a defendant in the case,"" said Daniel J ShenSmith, a practising barrister from Lichfield.
""It is presumed that press and legal commentators are not posing a risk to the course of justice and that if things are reported factually, that shouldn't be a problem.
""There can't be open justice if none of it is reported.""
Mr ShenSmith, who runs a YouTube channel as the Blackbelt Barrister which aims to demystify the law for the public, said he did not believe the law would change as a result of the case.
""It's an interesting question as to where it goes next and how that's managed and policed, but the ultimate discretion lies with the judge,"" he said.
""If there were a case where somebody had made serious threats of harm and then wished to report on the proceedings, I believe the judge would probably say no.
""Open justice is a fine balance and I think parliament will be slow to interfere with the rules surrounding it.
""It could be viewed as an attack on the justice system. It's a difficult area.""
Since Belfield's conviction, YouTube continues to host his channel.
Videos in which he makes unpleasant remarks about the victims of his stalking remain live.
According to YouTube, he has been suspended from monetising his channel since February for violating their policy on harassment.
""If we see that a creator's off-platform behaviour harms our users, community, employees or ecosystem, we take action to protect the community,"" a spokesperson said.

technology	London Underground: Five Tube stations to get 4G coverage	"London Underground passengers at five major Tube stations will have access to 4G within six months, Transport for London (TfL) has said.
Bank, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Euston and Camden Town will gain coverage following a pilot scheme on the eastern end of the Jubilee line.
All major mobile phone networks have signed up to provide coverage across the Tube network, TfL said. 
Sadiq Khan said the scheme was ""central to London's economic recovery"".
London's mayor added: ""I committed to Londoners that I would deliver 4G throughout the Tube network as part of my determination to build a better London for everyone - and I have no doubt that this will transform journeys for millions of passengers.""
fL has awarded a 20-year deal to 4G and 5G infrastructure company BAI Communications to counter the so called ""not-spots"" on the Tube.
work will eventually support a 4G and 5G rollout and will be the most advanced of its kind in the world, TfL said.
Once complete, customers will be able to make calls and access the internet wherever they are in the five stations.
Mobile phone reception has been available on the eastern half of the Jubilee line since March 2021.
month Vodafone and Virgin Media O2 joined Three and EE as part of the BAI Communications scheme, meaning the four major phone networks have signed up. 
Mobile coverage on underground sections of the Tube had only previously been available while a short trial was taking place on the Waterloo and City line during summer in 2017.
BAI has pledged to invest more than £1bn on establishing a backbone of mobile and digital connectivity for London. 
Further sections of Tube network, including stations across the City and West End on the Central line, will go live by summer 2023, TfL said.

technology	Salma al-Shehab: Concern for Saudi student jailed for 34 years over tweets	"Leeds University has expressed deep concern for one of its PhD students who has been jailed for 34 years in Saudi Arabia over critical tweets. 
Salma al-Shehab, 34, a Saudi citizen and mother of two, was arrested in 2021 while on holiday in the kingdom. 
Before the trip she had called for reforms and the release of activists.
Human rights groups said the harsh sentence gave the lie to Saudi claims it was improving women's rights and showed the situation was getting worse.
A terrorism tribunal convicted Shebab of aiding dissidents seeking to ""disrupt public order"" and publishing ""false rumours"", they said. 
warned that it was ""the longest prison sentence ever for a peaceful activist"" in the Gulf state, where Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has overseen a crackdown on dissent for five years.
Shehab, a member of Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia's Shia minority, describes herself on her Instagram account as a dental hygienist and medical educator. In addition to being in the final year of her PhD studies at Leeds University's School of Medicine, she says she is a lecturer at the Princess Nourah University in Riyadh.
Her Twitter account, which has 2,700 followers, has not been updated since 12 January 2021, three days before she was reportedly detained in Saudi Arabia.
At the end of the previous month, she tweeted or retweeted several messages calling for reforms in Saudi Arabia and the release of prominent activists, clerics and other intellectuals.
One post praised as ""prisoners of conscience"" a group of leading women's rights activists, including Loujain al-Hathloul, who were detained just before a ban on women driving was lifted in 2018 and were later convicted crimes against the state. Ms Hathloul was released on probation a month after Shehab's arrest but is subject to a travel ban and other restrictions.
US-based human rights group The Freedom House and UK-based group ALQST reported that Shehab was initially given a six-year prison sentence after being found guilty of violating the country's counter-terrorism and anti-cybercrime laws late last year.    
On 9 August, an appeals court increased her term to 34 years and added a 34-year travel ban that would start following her release, they said, citing court documents.
Bethany Al-Haidari, the Saudi case manager at the Freedom Initiative, described the sentence as ""abhorrent"".
""Saudi Arabia is boasting to the world that they are improving women's rights and implementing legal reforms. But there is no question with this sentence that the situation is just getting worse,"" she told the BBC's Newshour programme on Saturday.
""We also have gotten reports that there are hundreds of young women who were detained around the same time as Salma was.""
ALQST's head of communications Lina al-Hathloul, Loujain al-Hathloul's sister, said the sentence showed Saudi authorities remained ""hellbent on harshly punishing anyone who expresses their opinions freely"". 
""The release of Loujain al-Hathloul and other women's rights activists came about in response to sustained international pressure. However, as the spotlight on Saudi Arabia has gradually faded, the authorities have reverted to their habitual pattern of repression,"" she told the BBC. 
was ""connected to the growing rehabilitation"" of Crown Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, she added.
A month ago US President Joe Biden met the prince in Jeddah, despite having pledged to make Saudi Arabia a ""pariah"" over its human rights record.
A Leeds University spokesperson said: ""We are deeply concerned to learn of this recent development in Salma's case and we are seeking advice on whether there is anything we can do to support her. 
""Our thoughts remain with Salma, her family, and her friends among our close-knit community of postgraduate researchers.""
A US state department spokesman said it was studying Shehab's case and that ""exercising freedom of expression to advocate for the rights of women should not be criminalised"".

technology	Manx Care faces £170k fine over patient data breach	"Manx Care will have to pay a £170,500 fine if it does not put suitable measures in place following a data protection breach involving a patient's private data.
An insecure email attachment containing the patient's confidential health details was sent to 1,870 recipients.
's information commissioner said the financial penalty would not be imposed if secure systems were put in place by 31 December.
Manx Care said work was under way. 
Information Commissioner Iain McDonald said it was ""unacceptable for such a significant personal data breach to occur"".
When the email was sent in October last year, Manx Care had already been under an enforcement notice issued to the health department over its handling of confidential data, with a second issued in February this year.
""Previous enforcement notices attempted to get Manx Care to appropriately protect the patient data with which it is entrusted,"" Mr McDonald said.
""The continued failure of Manx Care to implement a secure means of communicating patient data has ultimately led to the imposition of this penalty.
""The decision to stay the payment of the penalty provides another opportunity for Manx Care to take the necessary action - public funds will only be diverted if it fails to do so.  
""It is now up to Manx Care.""
In a statement, the health care provider said the diversion of some staff to other roles during the coronavirus pandemic and limited resources had held up progress with the implementation of more secure patient data sharing systems.
""We acknowledge the significant failures outlined in the Enforcement Notice, which make for uncomfortable reading, and would like to offer our sincere and unreserved apologies to those individuals whose data was breached through no fault of their own,"" the statement added.

technology	Hackers may have exploited security flaws - Apple	"Apple has released an update to fix security flaws on its iPhone, iPad and Mac devices, which it says hackers may have ""actively exploited"".
mpany said the new software ""provides important security updates and is recommended for all users"".
flaw could allow hackers to take complete control of affected devices, industry experts have suggested.
update has been made available to iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 and later and iPad 5th gen and later.
It is also available to the iPad mini 4 and later versions and the iPod touch (7th generation). Mac users running macOS Monterey are also being encouraged to update.
Apple said hackers used the flaw to infiltrate WebKit, the engine that powers Apple web browser Safari. The technology company said the exploit could be used by hackers if the user accessed ""maliciously-crafted web content"". 
re have so far been no confirmed reports of specific cases where the security flaw has been used against people or devices.
Software updates are an everyday (and sometimes irritating) part of our modern tech lives, but this is one update not to ignore.
r-security world is rightly concerned about the potential power hackers could wield if they target a device that is vulnerable to this attack.
So it's sensible to check the settings on your Apple gear and install the patch.  
Even better - turn on automatic updates.
For the vast majority of users there is nothing to panic about as there is no suggestion that hackers have exploited the security loophole to launch mass attacks against the general public.
It also has to be said that the outcry on social media about the security update is possibly overblown.
Apple has released similar emergency security updates throughout the year - most recently in March - without much fanfare or panic.
According to its security update page: ""Apple doesn't disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until an investigation has occurred and patches or releases are available""."	/news/technology-62602909
technology	Lab-grown brain cells play video game Pong	"Researchers have grown brain cells in a lab that have learned to play the 1970s tennis-like video game, Pong.
r ""mini-brain"" can sense and respond to its environment.
Writing in the journal Neuron, Dr Brett Kagan, of the company Cortical Labs, claims to have created the first ''sentient'' lab-grown brain in a dish.
Other experts describe the  work as ''exciting'' but say calling the brain cells sentient is going too far.
""We could find no better term to describe the device,'' Dr Kagan says. ''It is able to take in information from an external source, process it and then respond to it in real time.""
Mini-brains were first produced in 2013, to study microcephaly, a genetic disorder where the brain is too small, and have since been used for research into brain development. 
But this is the first time they have been plugged into, and interacted with, an external environment, in this case a video game.
research team:
In response, the cells produced electrical activity of their own. 
xpended less energy as the game continued. 
But when the ball passed a paddle and the game restarted with the ball at a random point, they expended more recalibrating to a new unpredictable situation.
mini-brain learned to play in five minutes. 
It often missed the ball - but its success rate was well above random chance. 
Although, with no consciousness, it does not know it is playing Pong in the way a human player would, the researchers stress.
Dr Kagan hopes the technology might eventually be used to test treatments for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.
""When people look at tissues in a dish, at the moment they are seeing if there is activity or no activity. But the purpose of brain cells is to process information in real time,"" he says. ""Tapping into their true function unlocks so many more research areas that can be explored in a comprehensive way.""
Next, Dr Kagan plans to test the impact alcohol has on the mini-brain's ability to play Pong. 
If it reacts in a similar way to a human brain, this would underscore just how effective the system might be as an experimental stand-in.
Dr Kagan's description of his system as sentient, however, differs from many dictionary definitions, which state it means having the capacity to have feelings and sensations. 
Cardiff Psychology School honorary research associate Dr Dean Burnett prefers the term ''thinking system''.
''There is information being passed around and clearly used, causing changes, so the stimulus they are receiving is being 'thought about' in a basic way,'' he says.
mini-brains are likely to become more complex as the research progresses - but Dr Kagan's team are working with bioethicists to ensure they do not accidentally create a conscious brain, with all the ethical questions that would raise.
""We have to see this new technology very much like the nascent computer industry, when the first transistors were janky prototypes, not very reliable - but after years of dedicated research, they led to huge technological marvels across the world,"" he says.
Artificial-intelligence (AI) researchers have already produced devices that can beat grandmasters at chess.
But Prof Karl Friston, of University College London, who is working with Dr Kagan, says: ""The mini-brain learned without it being taught and so is more adaptable and flexible.""

technology	Your next job interview could take place in virtual reality	"Going for a job interview is the stuff of nightmares for many people, while for others it is a chance to shine.
Either way you are typically still interviewed by other human beings, either after walking into a scary office with one or more bosses sitting behind a desk, or via an equally nerve-wracking Zoom call.
Yet thanks to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) technology, you may soon be interviewed for that job you really want... by a computer. 
Earlier this year students at Sandwell College in West Bromwich put on VR headsets to do some mock interviews.
r avatars - cartoon-like, 3D representations of themselves - were put through their paces by another talking avatar representing the AI software system.
""I'd never had an interview before in my life,"" says engineering student Ayyan Ahmed. ""But because there was no human judging me, and it was all online, I could actually express myself.
""And then, at the end of the process, he [the VR interviewer] told me what I did wrong, and what I did right. It really helped me to know what to do in my next interview.""
VR system the students were using is made by London-based company Bodyswaps.
Questions and requests that the interviewees get asked range from the straightforward ""tell me about your greatest achievements"", to the more challenging ""do you prefer to be loved or feared?""
user then gets feedback, not just on what they said, but how they say it, whether they are maintaining eye contact with the interviewer avatar, and even their posture.
Bodyswaps' chief executive Christophe Mallet says the idea is that people can keep practising with the simulated job interviews until they feel ready for a real-life one.
He believes that the technology has the chance to level the playing field for candidates from less well-off backgrounds who might not otherwise have the opportunity to practise for job interviews in a professional setting.
""Things like communication, empathy and leadership are the secrets to success [in interviews], but how can you practise those? If you are rich, you can get a coach. Otherwise you have e-learning [such as watching videos on the topic], but that doesn't work as you are lacking immersion.
""Using VR and AI we now have a way to immerse you safely in a simulation where you can practise interview conversations.""
Bodyswaps launched its interview simulations last year, and says it is mainly targeting schools, colleges and universities, so their students can practise before they enter the jobs market. Its business model is subscription based, with the amount an institution has to pay each year being dependent on how many people use the system.
While Bodyswaps is currently focused on mock job interrogations, the AI technology of Swedish firm Tengai is already allowing firms out in the real world to get a computer to do their initial job interviews.
AI software is represented as a talking cartoon head that appears on the screen of a candidate's computer or smartphone. It asks a set list of questions, and then the recorded answers are used to help recruiters draw up shortlists for jobs.
gai's chief executive Elin Öberg Mårtenzon says that a central aim of the software is to avoid making wrong assumptions, such as judging someone on their appearance.
""We wanted to create a situation where you could actually look at objective data instead, by putting some sort of filter between the candidate and the recruiter,"" she says.
""And that filter is supposed to mitigate bias in the process… so that they know that they are not being judged by things other than those relating to the job description.""
But while it might be tempting to see AI and VR technology as the magical solution for selecting the right candidate for a job, employment lawyer Susan Thompson says we need to be cautious.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
""AI doesn't eliminate risk, and it's not without risk itself,"" says the partner at London law firm Simkins. ""So I think that's the most important thing employers need to be mindful of.
""We have to remember, AI is actually still fundamentally created by a human. [So], first and foremost, I'd be saying to any employer who's thinking of using it, be it at the interview stage, or even at the exit stage, 'do you understand it, and to what extent have you spoken to the developer about what data points it uses?'
""And, has it been stress tested to eliminate bias? Does it eliminate gender bias? And how does it do that?""
Ms Thompson adds: ""I would be hesitant in advocating that AI is used exclusively in the interview process. I think there should be some sort of human intervention somewhere."""	/news/business-63311886
technology	Mario Kart: Next game could be 'victim of current title's success'	"most successful racing video game franchise of all time started with a simple concept.
In 1992, Nintendo released Super Mario Kart on their Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) console.
game was produced by Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and followed the release of F-Zero - a well-received debut on the console for another popular racing series - but as a single-player experience, the company wanted to take things further.
ment team set out to create a two-player racing game which displayed both players on the same game screen simultaneously. But due to the limitations of the SNES, it wouldn't have been possible to illustrate the futuristic high speeds of F-Zero, so it needed to slow things down a bit. 
As a result, they decided to go with karts. However, it wasn't originally planned to feature Mario, Princess Peach and friends. 
A few months into development, when they had a prototype of two karts featuring generic racers of guys in overalls, they decided to see how Mario would look in the game. According to Miyamoto, everyone agreed it looked better with the inclusion of their famous mascot and so, the Mario Kart series was born.
Industry analyst Serkan Toto of Kantan Games describes the title as a ""system seller"" for the SNES.
""Already back then, Nintendo was leveraging the Mario brand,"" he tells the BBC. ""So they put Mario in there to sell more copies of the game than with, for example, a new character that they would have to come up with.
""It actually made a lot of sense to put characters of the Mario universe into that racing game.""
wer-ups - which are now synonymous with the series - were there, including the ability to throw shells and bananas to hamper opponents as well as collect coins to boost speed. 
It also included battle mode where players attempt to try and pop their opponent's balloons in more open environments, which remains a popular part of the series. 
rty years later, the fun of playing with friends and family remains a huge part of Mario Kart's charm. 
Following the initial game, Nintendo has gone on to release at least one new title for almost all of their subsequent consoles, along with various spin-off titles including a mobile game.
In total, nearly 168 million copies have been sold worldwide and it remains the most popular Mario spin-off game series.
""I think that as far as racing games go, in terms of sales, status or impact on the genre, it's difficult to think of a more influential one than this,"" says Toto.
game's popularity has resulted in the creation of various similar concepts by other developers such as Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and Crash Team Racing to name a few. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Nintendo Switch is the latest release in the main series, and, in February 2022, a paid ""Booster Course Pass"" was announced for the game. The download pack (known in the industry as downloadable content, or DLC) will eventually bring a total of 48 more courses, in six instalments. The new racetracks will include classics from series' history, alongside various new tracks. 
With the release doubling the number of circuits available, much of the gaming community felt it was good value for money and welcomed the update. However, some were left disappointed about the lack of a new entry in the main franchise, five years after the release of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
Furthermore, when the first batch of DLC courses dropped, not all players were happy. 
Some complained that the additional circuits lacked the quality of the game's original content, while it's also been claimed that too many of the new courses are ported from the Mario Kart Tour mobile app, bringing that game's art style with them. 
Eurogamer's Oliver Mackenzie said as part of his in-depth look: ""The best MK8 tracks combine challenging sets of fast corners with extended anti-gravity sections, multiple viable routes, and track hazards.
""Most of the new tracks are sedate in comparison, with laid-back layouts, less interesting track features, and little in the way of vehicle transformations.
""Simply porting mobile tracks over without major modifications means they don't match the gameplay concepts in Mario Kart 8 especially well.""
Following the recent release of the second wave, in the conclusion of his review, Ollie Reynolds from Nintendo Life said: ""Ultimately, Wave 2 Of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe doesn't quite knock it out of the park. 
""We know we've been bashing these courses left, right, and centre, but when it comes to Mario Kart, we have pretty high standards, you know. However, none of the tracks on offer are straight-up bad; most of them just feel like 'b-side' filler when compared to the main tracks created specifically for Mario Kart 8.""
""We have to keep reminding ourselves of the bigger picture, too; we've now got 16 new courses for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and we're not even halfway through yet. We've still got a ways to go.""
With new courses releasing periodically until the end of 2023, a sequel to the bestselling game in the series so far before then is unlikely.
Nintendo declined to comment on this article.
WATCH: Mixed-reality Mario Karts race around the home
Other than Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, an augmented reality game where a radio-controlled toy car races around the player's house while streaming video from the onboard cameras directly into the video game, there hasn't been an original release title since 2014 - with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe essentially an enhanced Nintendo Switch update of the original Mario Kart 8 title on the Wii U. 
Another highly successful game, Grand Theft Auto Five, didn't get an official sequel throughout the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One era, essentially skipping a generation and it looks as though Nintendo might do the same with the Switch and Mario Kart 8. 
However, both developers will feel as though their games have received sufficient improvements to keep them fresh. Mario Kart 8's initial upgrade to Deluxe featured various additions, including a further five playable characters and now the subsequent DLC release.
With both GTA 5 and Mario Kart 8 in the top 10 best-selling video games of all time and a GTA 5 release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X earlier this year, they continue to generate a significant amount of revenue - so perhaps it's no surprise that neither Rockstar nor Nintendo have been in a rush to release sequels.  
In terms of an eventual follow-up to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Toto predicts gamers may have to wait until the release of the Switch's successor. 
""It's hard to say but if I had to, I think there would be some distance to Mario Kart 8, maybe 2024, something like that,"" he says.
""But I think, if Mario Kart 9 comes out with a new Switch console, I think they will launch it as a launch title, or very close to launch."" 
However, any new game in such a popular series will look to bring fresh ideas to the table - something Nintendo have been able to do so far, but Toto feels one of their biggest challenges is to keep delivering moving forward.
""Mario Kart 8 is so well made, that it might even be a victim of its own success,"" he explains.
""I heard that apparently, Nintendo came up with a new idea for Mario Kart 9. I think that they need a little bit of a reboot for Mario Kart 9. I'm not saying that Nintendo is rebooting the series, but what I'm trying to say is, I think they need a new angle for the series.""
""I think that Mario Kart 9 actually has to offer something new because just a rehash of Mario Kart 8 is probably not going to cut it for Nintendo."""	/news/entertainment-arts-62362647
technology	Molly Russell: Instagram posts seen by teen were safe, Meta says	"Instagram posts about suicide and depression viewed by a 14-year-old girl before she took her own life ""were safe"", an inquest has heard.
Molly Russell, from Harrow, engaged with thousands of such posts in the months before her death in 2017.
Her family claim the content encouraged suicide and self-harm.
Elizabeth Lagone, an executive at Meta which owns Instagram, said she believed it was ""safe for people to be able to express themselves"" online.
She added the posts were ""complex"" and often a ""cry for help"".
quest at North London Coroner's Court was told out of the 16,300 posts Molly saved, shared or liked on Instagram in the six-months before her death, 2,100 were depression, self-harm or suicide-related.
Ms Lagone, the social media giant's head of health and wellbeing, was shown a number of them.
Russell family's lawyer, Oliver Sanders KC, asked of each post shown to her whether she believed they promoted or encouraged suicide or self-harm.
She said she thought it ""safe for people to be able to express themselves"", but conceded two posts would have violated Instagram's policies.
Instagram's guidelines at the time said users were allowed to post content about suicide and self-harm to ""facilitate the coming together to support"" other users but not if it ""encouraged or promoted"" this.
Ms Lagone told the court she thought the content Molly saw was ""nuanced and complicated"", adding it was important to give people a voice if they were experiencing suicidal thoughts.
In a heated exchange which saw Mr Sanders shout, he asked why Instagram allowed children on the platform when it was ""allowing people to put potentially harmful content on it"" and suggested Meta ""could just restrict it to adults"".
Ms Lagone replied the topic of harm was an ""evolving field"" and that Instagram policies were designed with consideration to users aged 13 and over. 
When pressed by coroner Andrew Walker to clarify whether she thought the posts were safe, she replied ""Yes, it is safe"".
She said Meta's understanding was there was no clear research into the effect posts have on children but their research reported a ""mixed experience"".
Questioning why Instagram felt it could choose which material was safe for children to view, the coroner then asked: ""So why are you given the entitlement to assist children in this way?
""Who has given you the permission to do this? You run a business.
""There are a great many people who are ... trained medical professionals. What gives you the right to make the decisions about the material to put before children?""
Ms Lagone responded: ""That's why we work closely with experts.""
She added decisions were not ""made in a vacuum"".
During the day's proceedings, videos the teenager accessed on Instagram were played to the court with the coroner once again warning the material had the ""potential to cause great harm"".
He said the content ""seeks to romanticise and in some way validate the act of harm to young people"", before urging anyone who wanted to leave the room to do so, with one person leaving.
When shown a note on Molly's phone which used the words ""I just want to be pretty"", Mr Sanders said the language was identical to a post the teenager had viewed on Instagram two days before.
""It's identical language... this is Instagram literally giving Molly ideas that she need to be concerned about her weight, correct?"" Mr Sanders asked.
Ms Lagone replied: ""I can't speak about what Molly may have been thinking.""
Referring to all the material viewed by the teenager the family considered to be ""encouraging"" suicide or self-harm, Mr Sanders continued: ""Do you agree with us that this type of material is not safe for children?""
Ms Lagone said policies were in place for all users and described the posts viewed by the court as a ""cry for help"".
Soon after the inquest began, Molly's father Ian Russell said he had been shocked by the ""dark, graphic, harmful material"" available for children to view online.
Mr Russell told the inquest much of the content seemed to ""normalise"" self-harm and suicide.
On Thursday, Pinterest's head of community operations, Judson Hoffman, apologised after  admitting the platform was ""not safe"" when the 14-year-old used it.
quest continues.

technology	Four Tet wins royalty battle over streaming music	"Pioneering electronic artist Four Tet has reached a settlement in the legal battle against his former record label. 
musician, whose real name is Kieran Hebden, sued Domino Records last year over the royalties he gets paid when his music is downloaded or streamed.
He argued that the 13.5% royalty rate he was being offered was unfair, and demanded a 50% split with the label.
In a settlement, Domino agreed to the honour the 50% rate and reimbursed the musician for historic underpayments.
It was quite a reversal for the indie label, which originally responded to the case by removing several Four Tet albums from streaming services (they were later reinstated).
""It has been a difficult and stressful experience to work my way through this court case and I'm so glad we got this positive result,"" wrote Hebden in a statement announcing the settlement. 
""Hopefully I've opened up a constructive dialogue and maybe prompted others to push for a fairer deal on historical contracts, written at a time when the music industry operated entirely differently.""
result could set a legal precedent for contract disputes in the music business; where royalty rates have been subject to heavy scrutiny since last year's inquiry into the streaming market by MPs on the Culture Select Committee.
However, Four Tet's legal challenge was ultimately decided out of court, so any future disputes would not be able to cite a legal judgement.
""Neither the courts, nor the settlement terms, have made any determination as to how streaming should be categorised or streaming income split,"" said Domino Records in a statement, adding it was ""pleased"" that Hebden had chosen to settle the case on ""financial terms first offered to him in November 2021"".
ute concerned the recording contract Hebden signed with Domino in 2001, which resulted in four albums: Pause (2001), Rounds (2003), Everything Ecstatic (2005) and There Is Love In You (2010).
was signed before the advent of downloads of streams - and his dispute hinged on whether those methods of accessing his music could be defined as a ""sale"" or a ""licence"" under the terms of his contract.
fference is far from academic because most artists receive 50% of the royalties for a licence but a much lower figure, typically between 12% and 22%, for a sale. 
Historically, the difference was due to the way music was distributed: selling music in the era of CDs, vinyl and cassettes incurred huge costs in manufacturing and distribution, which meant labels needed to cover their overheads. But when music is licensed to movies, television or advertisements, artists generally get a bigger payday, on the understanding that a third party is bearing the relevant costs. 
After the advent of iTunes and Spotify, labels often argued that downloads and streams should  be counted as sales.
rompted a flurry of lawsuits, especially in the US. Most famously, the producers who discovered Eminem won a case against Universal Records that forced the label to pay the higher ""licensing"" rate when his songs were downloaded.
Four Tet's case in the UK essentially made the same argument.
Domino had argued that digital downloads, including streams, were considered a new technology format and Hebden was only entitled to the 13.5% royalty rate (although they have paid him as much as 18% on a discretionary basis).
quickly became complicated, with Hebden adding a claim for breach of contract after Domino withdrew his music from streaming services; and Domino saying they may to take the case to the High Court, which Hebden could not afford.
However, in a statement posted on social media today, Hebden said he had been offered the 50% rate he had sought in a settlement, the details of which were made public.
""Domino have now agreed to treat streaming and download income as licensing income and will apply the 50% rate to streaming and download income going forward, and have reimbursed Kieran for the underpayment over recent years,"" said his lawyer, Aneesh Patel, in a statement.
""I really hope that my own course of action encourages anyone who might feel intimidated by challenging a record label with substantial means,"" added Hebden.
""Unlike Domino, I didn't work with a big law firm and luckily the case took place in the IPEC [Intellectual Property and Enterprise court] where legal costs are capped, so I was able to stand my ground.""
Hebden shared images of the settlement, which showed that he would receive £56,921.08 in respect of all historical streaming and download income, dated back to July 2017, in addition to interest calculated at a rate of 5% per year.
In a statement to the BBC, Domino added: ""Kieran's claim arose from differing interpretations of specific clauses in a contract entered into by Kieran and Domino in 2001 in the pre-streaming era, and the application of those clauses to streaming income. 
""Since 2021 Kieran has added to and pursued his claim despite numerous attempts by Domino to settle the matter.
""The case now having been settled, we are glad to be able to dedicate our full attention to resourcing and supporting our artists and we wish Kieran continued success in his career.""

technology	Elon Musk's Starlink to help strengthen internet in remote UK places	"Elon Musk's satellites are to be part of a UK trial to get high-speed internet to remote homes and companies.
kage of connectivity - operated by his Starlink technology - is part of government plans to ensure everyone can access reliable coverage.
It will test how more than 3,000 low-Earth orbit small satellites can be used to help more than a dozen ""very hard to reach"" places.
rollout will initially be trialled at three remote locations.
re the 12th-Century Rievaulx Abbey in North York Moors National Park, Wasdale Head in the Lake District and within Snowdonia National Park.  
After the trials, the government will consider the viability of using the technology.
Recent tests have shown that in many locations, Starlink satellites can deliver internet speeds of up to 200 megabits a second - four times faster than the current UK average of just over 50Mbps, said the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.
Digital Secretary Michelle Donelan said satellites could ""be the answer"" to getting isolated places connected and that it was ""crucial"" to the government's Levelling Up plan. 
""These trials aim to find a solution to the prohibitively high cost of rolling out cables to far-flung locations,"" she said.
Broadband signals beamed down by relatively low-flying satellites can be an effective way for remote areas to get high-speed internet access, especially when they cannot be reached by copper cables.
Parts of Ukraine, for example, have had free access to the Starlink service to help people there stay connected after Russia's invasion.
Mr Musk made the commitment to continue funding the project, despite it running at a loss.
""Even though Starlink is still losing money and other companies are getting billions of taxpayer dollars, we'll just keep funding Ukraine government for free,"" he tweeted.
Starlink has been vital for Ukraine's military and people to stay online.
uncement in the government's £5bn Project Gigabit initiative, with the ambition of getting rid of the UK's notspots - areas where there is no internet. There are still many more than you may think.
Satellite broadband is a decent option where operators can't get cables or it simply isn't economically viable to install them - but it's also the most expensive for consumers.
It's not clear how much the government will be paying Starlink, but it costs about £75 per month for ordinary customers, after the £460 fee for the equipment.
What has raised eyebrows is that it has chosen not to use OneWeb, the British satellite broadband firm in which it invested hundreds of millions of pounds just two years ago to save it from bankruptcy. 
firm is now being taken over by French company Eutelsat. The UK said it went with the technology which was ""available and ready"" to use - which does not sound like a huge vote of confidence in its own stake."	/news/technology-63819322

technology	Zuckerberg tells Rogan FBI warning prompted Biden laptop story censorship	"Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook restricting a story about Joe Biden's son during the 2020 election was based on FBI misinformation warnings. 
New York Post alleged leaked emails from Hunter Biden's laptop showed the then vice-president was helping his son's business dealings in Ukraine.
Facebook and Twitter restricted sharing of the article, before reversing course amid allegations of censorship.
Zuckerberg said that getting the decision wrong ""sucks"".
""When we take down something that we're not supposed to, that's the worst,"" Zuckerberg said in a rare extended media interview on the Joe Rogan podcast.
New York Post story was released just weeks before the presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, which Mr Biden won.
It claimed that a laptop, abandoned in a repair shop by Hunter Biden, contained emails which included details of Hunter introducing a Ukrainian energy tycoon to his father and arranging a meeting. There is no record on Mr Biden's schedule that such a meeting ever took place.
Critically, it fed into long-running unproven allegations about corruption on Joe Biden's part to ensure his son's business success in Ukraine.
In that context, the New York Post story, based on exclusive data no other news agency had access to, was met with scepticism - and censored by social media outlets. 
Zuckerberg told Rogan: ""The background here is that the FBI came to us - some folks on our team - and was like 'hey, just so you know, you should be on high alert. We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election, we have it on notice that basically there's about to be some kind of dump that's similar to that'.""
He said the FBI did not warn Facebook about the Biden story in particular - only that Facebook thought it ""fit that pattern"".
rticle remains controversial. The hard drive at its centre was provided to the Post by Donald Trump's own lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. 
More than a year after the story appeared, the Washington Post conducted its own analysis and concluded the laptop and some emails were likely to be authentic - but the majority of data could not be verified due to ""sloppy handling of the data"". 
Other once-sceptical news organisations such as the New York Times have agreed at least some of the emails are genuine.
Rogan, one of the most popular podcasters in the world with an audience of millions for each episode, has himself been accused of spreading misinformation in the past.
Asking Zuckerberg if he regretted suppressing the factual story, the Facebook founder replied: ""It sucks... I think in the same way that having to go though a criminal trial but being proven innocent in the end sucks... in the end you're free.""
But Zuckerberg acknowledged that there remained disagreement about the story, which he said was a ""hyper-political issue"".
""Depending on what side of the political spectrum [you're on], you either think we didn't censor it enough or we censored it way too much.""
Facebook did not completely ban sharing of the article, but instead limited how much its algorithm automatically shared it to other people for a week, while third-party fact-checkers tried to verify the reporting.
So while people could post the article and discuss it, it was less likely to spread organically to new users.
By contrast, Twitter banned sharing of the article at all. Both social media companies found themselves blasted by US Republicans and Donald Trump supporters, and had to explain their actions before a US Senate hearing in the following days.
Meta, Facebook's parent company, highlighted that Zuckerberg had addressed the FBI warnings at that 2020 hearing, saying of the Joe Rogan interview that ""none of this is new"".
But in a wide-ranging interview that covered Meta's virtual reality ambitions and Zuckerberg's personal life, the creator of Facebook also talked about his dislike for dealing with such thorny issues. 
""I didn't get into this to basically judge these things. I got into this to design technology that helps people connect,"" he told Rogan.
""This whole thing that is arbitrating what is OK and what is not - I obviously have to be involved in that because, at some level, I run the company and I can't just abdicate that.
""But I also don't think that as a matter of governance you want all of that decision making vested in one individual."""	/news/world-us-canada-62688532
technology	Attacks on politicians whipped up by abuse, MP Charlotte Nichols says	"A Labour MP who has been physically assaulted and had someone come to her office armed with a knife has said she believes much of what she has faced ""has been whipped up by things online"".
Warrington North's Charlotte Nichols said ""clear laws"" were needed to deal with ""online harassment"".
A BBC investigation found MPs received thousands of abusive tweets.
Fellow MP Angela Rayner, who has had death threats, said there was ""no excuse"" for online abuse.
uty Labour leader, who represents Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester, said she agreed with what Ms Nichols had said and it was her experience that online abuse ""comes in waves"".
BBC analysis of three million tweets aimed at MPs over a six-week period found more than 130,000, about one in 20, could be classed as toxic.
Ms Nichols received more than 11,000 messages in the period, 8.3% of which were found to be toxic, while 4% of the 83,000 tweets Ms Rayner was sent were abusive.
Other North-West MPs had similar percentages, with 4.5% of the messages sent to Ribble Valley's Conservative representative Nigel Evans being abusive, 4.3% of those sent to both Labour's Andrew Gwynne and Alison McGovern, who represent Denton and Reddish and Wirral South, and 4.8% of those sent to Angela Eagle, the Labour MP for Wallasey.
Ms Nichols told BBC North West Tonight that she believed the online abuse had led to consequences in real life. 
""I've had someone come to my office with a knife before [and] I've had physical violence against me,"" she said, adding she had stepped up security at both her home and her office.
""A lot of that has been whipped up by things that have been online.""
She said that there was a ""need to have clear laws, particularly around online harassment"", but added that politicians had to lead by example.
""I think ultimately that all of us in some form of public life, whether it's in the council chamber or the chamber in Westminster, need to be modelling a good kind of debate that is based on policies and not on personal attacks,"" she said.
Ms Nichols has previously spoken about how she has been targeted since winning her seat at the 2019 general election.
She said at the time that she was ""horrified"" by the ""extent and severity"" of anti-Semitic and homophobic abuse she had received both online and in the post.
Ms Rayner said she had received repeated abuse, including ""very derogatory language"", sexist remarks, threats against her children and being called ""stupid and thick"" because of her Manchester accent.
She said there was ""no excuse or no place"" for such comments in political debate and they caused ""significant harm"".
""These comments about my personal attributes and who I am as an individual, as opposed to policy, are the things that really worry me,"" she added.
witter has previously said it is committed to combatting abuse as outlined in its Hateful Conduct Policy.
mpany has also previously pointed out it has a much more open platform than other social media companies, which allows researchers to ""enhance and research the public conversation"".

technology	Nintendo lands Call of Duty in 10-year Microsoft deal	"Microsoft has entered into a 10-year agreement to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo consoles, following its plan to acquire the game's publisher.
Microsoft wants to buy Activision Blizzard, which also makes Overwatch and Warcraft, for $68.7bn (£56.5bn).
would enable Microsoft to stop Call of Duty from appearing on rival consoles, such as Sony's PlayStation 5.
UK watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), says this could lessen competition in gaming.
Microsoft says this is not the case, and is now offering the title to rivals - for a limited time.
In announcing the deal, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the same offer was on the table for Sony, if it was willing to ""sit down and talk"".
CMA has launched an in-depth investigation into the deal, saying Sony's revenue and users could be ""significantly affected"" if it loses access to Call of Duty.
It noted that previous Microsoft deals have led to games being made Microsoft exclusives, with its acquisition of Bethesda resulting in the new game Starfield only appearing on Xbox and PC.
A CMA spokesperson said: ""We are aware of these developments and will continue to monitor the competitive landscape throughout our investigation.""
Sony has been a vocal critic of the acquisition, which it said in October is ""bad for competition, bad for the gaming industry, and bad for gamers themselves"", adding it would give Microsoft ""a dominant position in gaming"".
But the 10-year offer is significant for Nintendo, which last had a Call of Duty game on its consoles in 2013.
Phil Spencer, head of Microsoft's Xbox gaming division, said Call of Duty would continue to be available on PCs through Steam, a gaming distribution service.
means that in theory the game series could also be available on the Steam Deck - a handheld gaming computer not owned by Microsoft - although this would depend on the hardware requirements of subsequent releases.

technology	Twitter tests 'notes' feature with 2,500 word limit	"witter is trialling a new feature allowing users to share ""notes"" as long as 2,500 words.
media platform normally limits posts to 280 characters. 
witter said the move was a response to seeing people use the platform to post pictures of longer announcements and steer followers to outside newsletters. 
will run for two months and involve a small group of writers in Canada, Ghana, the UK and US.
w feature aims to keep audiences in the Twitter eco-system, with readers able to see a headline and access the longer note by clicking on a link.
Writers will be able to embed gifs, photos and other features into long-form essays that can be read on and off Twitter. Notes can also be edited after they have been published. 
""Since the company's earliest days, writers have depended on Twitter to share their work, get noticed, be read, create conversation - everything but the actual writing,"" the company said, making the announcement using the new Notes product.
""With Notes, the goal is to fill in that missing piece.""
move follows Twitter's purchase last year of Revue, a Dutch newsletter start-up.
Social media expert Dr Laura Toogood said the trial was a significant step for Twitter. She said the feature would encourage people to stay within the platform itself, rather than linking out to other websites that can host long-form content. 
""Adding this extra capability means that Twitter is now in a position to compete with some of the popular blogging platforms and potentially attract a new audience and a different type of user,"" she told the BBC. 
""It will also encourage existing users to blog within Twitter, rather than move to other websites for this purpose, which will help to retain their audience.""
In 2017 Twitter increased the maximum number of characters for tweets from 140 to 280, following a trial among a small group of users. 
move comes amid scrutiny of the Twitter's business prospects, as Elon Musk's planned takeover of the company raises questions about its direction.
firm announced in April it was working on an edit button, shortly after Mr Musk - who had called for such a feature - revealed he had bought a large stake in the company. Twitter said the events were unrelated. 
Mr Musk has also said he sees potential in a subscription model in which people would pay to use the platform.
Dr Nikki Usher, a journalism professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said it was hard to know whether Twitter was trying out new formats out of profitability or a genuine desire to try to improve the platform. 
""In this case, one of the things we do know is that people do not like to read long texts online,"" they told the BBC. 
""So whether giving people 2,500 characters to work with will ultimately make a difference in the quality of the digital public sphere - well, I think it's unlikely. Is it a chance to grab headlines in advance of some major changes at the company? Absolutely."""	/news/business-61904522
technology	Why record heat doesn't mean record solar power	"UK's heatwave is helping to generate large amounts of solar power - but experts say it's actually too hot for the highest levels of electricity generation.
rade body Solar Energy UK says the last few days have seen about 10% of Britain's electricity come from solar. 
But its chief executive Chris Hewett says: ""The heat itself brings down the efficiency of solar panels slightly.
""So don't expect to see records set.""
week has seen the UK record its highest ever day and night temperatures, with heat warnings being put in place for much of the country.
But for solar power generation, the amount of sunshine - also referred to as irradiance - is more important than the amount of heat,
""It's because of this balance between irradiance and temperature that the record for peak half-hourly generation is always in April or May, because that's when we get sunny but relatively cool weather,"" says Jamie Taylor, a senior data scientist at Sheffield University.
""The amount of generation coming from solar has been very high over the last week. But I think it's unlikely a new record will be set in terms of power generation."" 
Mr Taylor says the record for total daily energy generation from solar in the UK was 80.6 gigawatt hours (GWh) on 29 May 2020. 
It's thought around 64 GWh was generated by solar systems on Monday of this week.
A portion of that came from panels installed on homes - and, for the people who own them, the heatwave has provided an opportunity to make a small profit. 
rence Eden has solar panels and battery storage at his house in south London, and has been generating more power than he uses, selling the remainder back to the grid.
""For us, the energy meter has been spinning backwards, effectively"", he says.
""On a day like yesterday we generated 20 kilowatt hours of power, used eight, stored two, and sold ten back to the grid.""
Mr Eden estimates that earned him around £1.70.
He says his experience is that his solar panels work best around the summer solstice, when there is maximum daylight, but says that even over winter they have been useful.
He says the only time they don't work is when they're ""covered in snow""."	/news/technology-62220512
technology	Newport Wafer Fab: Job fears as Chinese told to sell microchip plant	"Job losses are ""inevitable"" if Nexperia is forced to sell its controlling stake in the UK's largest microchip factory, the company has said.
Newport Wafer Fab, which employs more than 500 people, was bought out by the subsidiary of Shanghai's Wingtech in July 2021. 
UK government has ordered the sale be reversed because of national security concerns.
It is worried about the potential influence of the Chinese government.
usiness's UK operations chief, Tony Versluijs, insisted there was ""no risk whatsoever"".
""We are genuinely shocked by this decision,"" he said.
""We believe it's the wrong decision and we'll look to get it overturned.""
It was, he said, wrong for the UK's semiconductor industry and for the taxpayer.
""Any other owner would have a hell of a job keeping the same level of jobs over here,"" Mr Versluijs said. 
""That would mean that redundancies would be inevitable.""
microchips made at Newport Wafer Fab, called semiconductors, let electricity flow through devices, and are key to smartphones, laptops and other tech.
UK and US politicians had concerns about Nexperia's acquisition of the site before the sale.
Cybersecurity expert Dominique Lazanski said that stemmed from how China could exploit control of the company.
""Most Chinese companies, 99.9% of them, have some sort of influence into them from the Chinese Communist Party,"" she said.
Industries had to seek approval for activities and investments through the Communist Party, she said. 
""When a Chinese company or a subsidiary goes and tries to buy a company that makes specific technology and holds specific intellectual property, that's a concern,"" she said.
""They have access effectively to the UK, to investment, to potentially what the government is doing and more importantly to research"".
UK government said its concerns centred around the threat of ""undermining UK capabilities"" in making semiconductors.
It claimed the site's location in the semiconductor cluster on the Duffryn industrial estate in Newport could ""facilitate access to technological expertise and know-how"".
Mr Versluijs dismissed those concerns about national security as hypothetical.
He said: ""The decision is not about what is actually happening at this site. It's all about what could happen. What might happen.
""It's all hypothetical - and the jobs are real"".
Employee Dennis Knight said they were stunned by the decision.
He said: ""There's complete disbelief at what the government have done"".
Linda Wainfur, who has worked there for 38 years, said: ""Although I'm coming to the end of my working life, it would be good to see other people being able to do the same.
""I truly believe that with this decision, that won't happen.""
UK government said the country had a strong semiconductor sector and the technology would ""continue to support the UK and global economy""."	/news/uk-wales-63668621

Meta, which owns Instagram, argued at a pre-inquest review that evidence should be given via video link from America.
quest is due to begin at North London Coroner's Court on 19 September.
Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, counsel for Meta, said head of health and wellbeing policy Elizabeth Lagone would require ""significant travel and time in London"" to attend in person.
Instead she said Ms Lagone would be prepared to start her evidence at 05:00 in the morning US time to coincide with hearings beginning at 10:00 in London.
Pinterest also argued one of its executives could not travel to London due to an important business meeting.
Global head of community operations Jud Hoffman was also said to be concerned about Covid and the need to protect his elderly parents.
But Oliver Sanders QC, barrister for the Russell family, said the request to give evidence remotely was ""disrespectful to the family and disrespectful to the court"".
He continued ""what we have here is two Irish corporations who have chosen to field witnesses based in the US"".
Senior coroner Andrew Walker ruled against the tech companies and ordered their witnesses appear in court in person to give evidence.
Mr Sanders then requested that Meta reveal more information about material the company had redacted.
He said that the names of accounts containing harmful material which had been suggested to Molly by Instagram's algorithm had not been provided by Meta.
He told the court the family, from Harrow, north-west London, found it very difficult to understand how it could send material ""unilaterally to a child but cannot send it to the family or coroner after her death"".
Meta replied it had a legal duty under English and US law to protect privacy and was concerned about the ""potential identification of vulnerable Instagram users"".

technology	New ground as tech aims to help boost soil health	"Farmers used to test the quality of their soil by burying a pair of underpants in the ground and seeing how quickly they rotted.
g that the more healthy micro-organisms there are in the ground, such as bacteria and fungi, the faster the fabric would be eaten away.
Bury the pants now and they may well be dug up the following year in pristine condition.
's because, according to experts, more than half of the world's agricultural soil is already degraded.
In India, soil degradation is one of the factors, alongside debt, that is said to have led to the shocking statistic of nearly 30 people in the farming sector taking their own lives, on average, every day.
ry to improve matters, a popular Indian guru called Sadhguru is continuing to lead a global campaign called SaveSoil, which pushes to improve soil health around the world. He is calling for farmers to be given incentives, such as financial support, to keep a minimum of 3% of organic content in their soil.
""If we take that away and soil becomes sand then it's over,"" he says. ""If we don't attend to our soil problem, we will all be left with desert.""
History has shown us the devastating consequences of poor soil.
""We all remember those images of the North American dust bowl from the 1930s, and being really shocked by that,"" says David Montgomery, professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington, and the author of three books on soil, including Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations.
reality of most soil degradation is a build-up over time, rather than a single catastrophic event, he adds.
""If you are consistently degrading land faster than you're rebuilding its fertility, you're drawing down its batteries, its ability to actually support agricultural production. Fertility is held in the top part of soil, which has literally been stripped off by decades to centuries of agriculture, and it just makes it that much harder to grow food.""
re are several causes of soil degradation, from overgrazing, to only growing one crop time after time, and excessive use of weed killers. But one contributing factor is a piece of technology that has revolutionised farming - the plough.
All around the world, from subsistence small holdings in Africa, to the huge mechanised farms of North Dakota, this very old piece of technology is a quintessential part of farming life.
Modern ploughing turns the soil in order to get rid of weeds, but in doing so it exposes microbes under the soil that are vital for its wellbeing. These microbes, now exposed to the sun, die and the soil loses its fertility.
ugh, alongside other machinery such as the combine harvester, has expanded the scale, speed and productivity of farming, leading to more efficient cultivation of more land.
But Ben Raskin, head of agroforestry and horticulture at the UK's Soil Association, says we need to rethink technology's role in farming.
""We have to make sure that technology supports soil and plant health,"" he says.
might mean new tools. Farm equipment suppliers such as John Deere are now introducing ""no-till machinery"" - farm equipment that is designed to cause minimum disturbance to the soil.
ude seed planters that drop seeds into small holes rather than using a big blade to dig a long trench.
Or it may mean using robots that can help plant and weed in a more gentle way. One such device is the Robotti, made by Danish agricultural tech firm AgroIntelli. The development of this was helped by UK musician-turned-organic farmer Andy Cato, from the band Groove Armada, who tested early versions.
Meanwhile, cover crops - those that are not harvested, but instead planted to stop the earth being left bare - help to improve soil structure by increasing the organic matter in it.
Ultimately though, says Mr Raskin, we may need to take the focus away from above-ground solutions and dig a little deeper.
""Much of the tech focus in farming has been on the chemical [pesticides] and physical [machinery], but now it is time to start thinking about biology,"" he says.
Currently it is believed that scientists have identified only around 10% of soil life.
Prof Montgomery says that for too long ""the whole world that is below ground was kind of invisible to science"". He adds: ""Soil is one of the last big frontiers of science - to understand what is going on in it.""
Understanding the make-up of soil could spawn whole new industries, such as biotech that focuses on gene sequencing the microbes in the soil, in an effort to provide farmers with the best nutrients for their land.
Going back to simple and old-fashioned techniques can also throw up interesting and potentially radical ideas.
One experiment, conducted as part of the Soil Association's Innovative Farmers programme, used willow woodchip mulch around trees in order to suppress weeds and disease. It was discovered that the acid in it actually stimulated an immune reaction in the trees.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
And the soil beneath our feet may hold the secrets to some much wider human medicinal breakthroughs.
Natural products from soil's microbiome are a promising source of medicinal compounds, according to an article in Chemistry World.
It points out that teixobactin - a toxin that could give rise to the first new class of antibiotics in 30 years - was discovered by sifting through soil samples.
For farmers worried about the quality of their soil - but unwilling to part with their underpants - there are more modern ways of measuring it.
Soil samples can be sent off to a laboratory to be tested, although this can be expensive and time-consuming. In the age of data and internet connectivity, smartphones can provide another solution.
Jack Ingle is the director of Harvest Agri, a UK firm that sells a device called a microbiometer soil test. Farmers take a soil sample, and add it to a test tube with a special solution, which is then transferred to paper. 
With a free app available on both Android and iPhone, the sample can be scanned to reveal a number that designates how many fungal and bacterial microbes are present.
And it is not just farmers who are measuring the quality of the soil.
A group of scientists have created a database of soil health measurements from sites across the globe called SoilHealthDB. And last year the EU established the EU Soil Observatory to collect and track soil data, and to support soil research and policy development.
But much of the future of farming technology could be about learning from the past, thinks Prof Montgomery.
""It's taking some of the ancient wisdom, like crop rotation and cover crops, and to merge that in new ways with modern technology - the sensors, the robots and the prospecting for microbial inoculants [beneficial micro-organisms],"" he says."	/news/business-63283986
technology	Roblox removes 'meat grinder' Ukraine v Russia game	"world's biggest gaming platform for children, Roblox, has removed two games that allowed players to fight and kill each other as Russians or Ukrainians.  
One of them, called War on Larkiv: Ukraine, was showcased to users in the Roblox discovery section.
It clocked up 90,000 plays in less than two weeks.
Roblox said that both games violated its community standards and removed them within four hours of being contacted by the BBC. 
War on Larkiv was based in a fictional city that resembled the real city of Kharkiv, where hundreds of people have died in indiscriminate shelling after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February this year.
r game, called Battle for Ukraine, had been on the Roblox website for months.
It allowed players to watch the bombing of cities such as Mariupol, which was besieged and largely destroyed by Russian forces earlier this year.
Fifty million players, mainly children, log in to Roblox every day to explore, play mini-games and create their own ""experiences"".
re are millions of these player-generated experiences.
most popular are showcased to Roblox players through a curated home screen, but others can be found using the search function.
War on Larkiv: Ukraine grew in popularity because it was showcased and had a review score of 71% from users.
It had also gained an audience on TikTok, with 4.7 million views of videos related to the title.
game encouraged players to upgrade their weapons in exchange for Roblox's in-game currency, Robux.
game page read: ""Grab your guns and choose your side to fight in the War on Larkiv: Ukraine. Heavy combat is taking place right now in the fictional city of Larkiv, soldiers strive with hope and destiny.""
Players could choose to fight for Ukraine or Russia, with a kill count on each side updating throughout the live game that anyone on the platform could take part in.
BBC monitored the game on and off for two days and found it had a continuous player base of about 10 to 40 people, with many sharing game chat in English, Ukrainian and Russian.  
A Roblox spokesman said: ""We have strict Community Standards which govern the portrayal of real-world events. Both of the experiences in question have been removed for violating our standards following an assessment by our moderation team.""
Ukrainian game developer Grisha Bolshakov, who fled his home in Kharkiv and is now living in the UK, said he would never try to make an entertainment game about the war.
""Obviously a game with this sensational topic will resonate and generate interest on social platforms, but I would never touch this topic for an entertainment product,
""It's not helping to educate players morally or take a real look at rather sad things. It's just making fun from the meat grinder happening in the real world.""
Controversies are not new to Roblox, a huge sprawling world of games valued at about $24bn (£18bn).
Recent headlines have referred to sex rooms and inappropriate sexual content about Kim Kardashian.
re are also other war simulation games seemingly based on active Middle Eastern conflicts that have been available for over a year.
""The model is broken,"" technology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says of Roblox's moderation system.
""There is an argument that the company has the right to profit from content that some people find offensive, but clearly these games broke their own decency rules, so why wasn't it spotted before a reporter found it? 
""It comes down to incentive - there's no penalty or enforcement, so the company can just rely on inadequate tools and staffing and this will keep happening.""
Unlike many games companies, Roblox has not stopped or suspended trading in Russia since the invasion.
At a recent Roblox developer conference, Chief Executive Dave Baszucki said Russia sees more than two million active Roblox users a day, according to Bloomberg reporting. "	/news/technology-63078950
technology	Netflix: Why some viewers are unsubscribing and switching off	"Subscribing to a streaming service can be a bit like ordering a take-away when you don't know what you want to eat - paying the money and hoping what arrives is to your taste.
In recent months, fewer people have become willing to take their chances on the streaming menu, with Netflix losing nearly one million subscribers between April and July - although that was less than the two million it had feared.
As some find the shows less appetising and have their household budgets squeezed, and with Netflix's Covid boom over and rivals trying to cook up a better offering, it seems our streaming tastes are changing.
One of Netflix's lost subscribers is James Leiper, 26, from Huddersfield. ""I bought a house last year, so I thought I needed to take control of what I was spending, and all the monthly subscriptions added up,"" he says.
""At one point, I had four streaming services and it was a lot of money each month for things I barely used. 
""Netflix was the first to go for me because there was only a handful of things on it I was watching.""
Mr Leiper says he is now more mindful of what he spends every month because of things like his electricity and gas bills going up.
""Five or six years ago, I'd watch everything on Netflix, and now there's not so much and I'm not tempted by anything on there,"" he explains.
An increasing number of British households feel the same way about streaming, with 700,000 fewer having at least one subscription compared with the start of the year, according to research firm Kantar. 
Younger viewers have been the most likely to unsubscribe, with more under-24s turning to alternatives like BBC iPlayer or ITV Hub. 
Netflix does remain the world's most popular streaming service, but Tuesday's figures showed its biggest fall in subscriber numbers to date, three months after its first ever drop sent its share price plummeting.
Squid Game, Stranger Things and Bridgerton have given it huge hits, but the company's recent strategy of churning out content has backfired, according to TV critic Hayley Campbell, co-host of the BBC Sounds Must Watch podcast.
""I think Netflix is losing numbers because it keeps pumping out endless shows without stopping to check if they're good,"" she explains.
She says Netflix's ""ratio of rubbish to brilliant is way off"" - but thinks it's now trying harder with shows like Heartstopper.
""Apple TV+ is the most interesting place for TV shows at the moment because it seems to be actually taking risks and investing money in making things like Shining Girls or Severance,"" she says.
Amazon Prime attracted more new subscriptions in the UK than its rivals in the last three months, according to Kantar. 
Campbell adds: ""The most interesting things on Amazon Prime right now aren't made by Amazon, they come from places like HBO.""
Another viewer, Matthew Rose, 26, from Devon, agrees: ""Netflix has great shows like Stranger Things and Squid Game but there's a lot of programmes that aren't high quality.
""The brand doesn't seem premium any more, and I only watch the big hitters because everyone's discussing them.""
He only pays for Disney+, cancelling other streaming services like Spotify last year, and relying on free trials for new customers.
Mr Rose says he accesses most of his content on YouTube ""because it's shorter and it's like a long-form TikTok"" with ""really interesting short documentaries"", which are free.
""I basically only have Disney Plus because I love Star Wars,"" he says.
For Netflix, he piggybacks on his sister's account. ""If she kicked me out then I wouldn't subscribe myself.""
key point about Netflix's share price is that its decline looks structural, rather than a blip. That is because of both the scale and the underlying trends, and the range of factors causing this drop are troubling investors and Netflix's leadership.
Surging global inflation creates a cost-of-living crisis. Ultimately, great television and movies are a (very) nice-to-have, not an essential like food, water or clothing. 
Commercial rivals are exceptionally strong: from Disney to Paramount and Amazon to Apple, the competition is brutal. The likes of Disney have realised that, rather than let Netflix monetise their work, they should do it themselves. So Netflix loses content, as rich rivals grow their libraries. 
A pandemic bump in subscribers, when millions of rich people were staying at home, flattered the figures. The pandemic also halted many productions, choking the supply of fresh shows.
Sharing passwords is one thing Netflix is hoping to crack down on - believing that is stifling growth.
Even the UK Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries does it, recently admitting in Parliament that there were ""four other people in different parts of the country"" using her account.
Streaming firms are also facing the growing phenomenon of flipping subscriptions - people cancelling one and re-starting another depending on which service has something they want to watch at the time.
One thing Netflix hopes will tempt people to stay is a cheaper plan that will carry adverts - although the details and pricing have not been revealed.
And Tuesday's two million fall in subscriber numbers is still relatively small given that Netflix added 18 million subscribers around the world in 2021, which took its total it to almost 222 million.
Amazon Prime Video had 175 million viewers in 2021, and Disney Plus' base topped 118 million.
Despite those huge numbers, traditional TV viewing usually still beats streaming in the UK ratings. At the peak of Squid Game's popularity last year, Barb - the TV ratings agency - found that broadcast programmes like the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing and ITV's Coronation Street attracted more eyeballs.
""The feel of watching TV with lots of people watching at the same time makes it less lonely,"" explains one viewer, Lucy Stirman from Stockton-on-Tees.
""Soaps are drama but easy to watch and it's not a big deal if you dip in and out.
""With Netflix and Amazon Prime, it's more when you know a good movie or series is going to be added and you hear people talking about them.""
32-year-old has not given up her Netflix account, though, explaining that the children's section is played every day for her daughter, who is almost one.
Even if some younger viewers are cancelling, another generation is growing up with streaming."	/news/entertainment-arts-62219598
technology	Molly Russell: Social media causes no end of issues, head says	"Social media causes ""no end of issues"" as it is ""almost impossible to keep track of"", the headteacher of Molly Russell's school has told an inquest.
14-year-old, from Harrow, viewed thousands of such posts in the months before she took her own life in 2017.
Sue Maguire told North London Coroner's Court social media had challenges that did not exist 10 or 15 years ago.
She said Hatch End High School had warned students about the ""dangers of social media for a long time"".
Giving evidence, Ms Maguire said: ""Our experience of young people is that social media plays a huge, dominant role in their lives and it causes no end of issues.
""There's a level where I want to say it's almost impossible to keep track of social media, but we have to try and we have to respond to the information as we receive it.""
quest was told that out of the 16,300 posts Molly saved, shared or liked on Instagram in the six months before her death, 2,100 were depression, self-harm or suicide-related.
Ms Maguire said staff were shocked when they became aware of the graphic content available to students like Molly on sites such as Instagram.
Deputy headteacher Rebecca Cozens, who is also head of safeguarding at the school, told the inquest that once young people had gone ""down the rabbit hole"" on social media, it was a ""deep one"".
Coroner Andrew Walker told the Russell family he would be delivering his conclusions by the end of the week.
So far, the inquest has heard from Molly's father, Ian Russell, who said he had been shocked by the ""dark, graphic, harmful material"" available for children to view online.
Last week, Pinterest's global head of community operations, Judson Hoffman, was asked by the family's barrister if the platform accepted that in 2017, when Molly was using it, it ""wasn't safe"", and Mr Hoffman replied: ""That's correct."" Mr Hoffman also told the inquest he deeply regretted that Molly saw content relating to self-harm, suicide and depression on the platform.
week, Elizabeth Lagone, an executive at Meta, which owns Instagram, said she believed it was ""safe for people to be able to express themselves"" online.
Child psychiatrist Dr Navin Venugopal also told the hearing he was ""not able to sleep well"" after seeing ""very disturbing"" self-harm material viewed on social media by Molly. 
quest continues.

One of them told the BBC a member of Elon Musk's team had said their jobs would be replaced by robots. 
A California state senator said Mr Musk was treating the former staff ""like garbage"".  
San Francisco's city attorney, David Chiu, said he's investigating if Mr Musk broke the law. Twitter has not responded to a BBC request for comment.
""Elon Musk has had a long history of flouting labour laws,"" Mr Chiu told the BBC. 
""While I'm not surprised this happened, I feel for these workers. We will be looking into this further.""
BBC spoke to four cleaners who say they were fired from Twitter on Monday - their interviews were conducted in Spanish. 
Adrianna Villarreal, who worked for Twitter for four years, said she's now worried she won't have enough money to feed her family over Christmas.
""It's a sad and frustrating thing for our families and children,"" she said. 
rs were working at Twitter last week until they were told their jobs were under threat. 
Olga Miranda, president of the cleaners' union, said they organised a strike on Monday to protest. The cleaners were then told they had been laid off effective immediately, she says.
""They did this three weeks before Christmas,"" she said. ""I think we were fired because we're a union."" 
Julio Alvarado had been a cleaner for 10 years at Twitter. He says the environment was always friendly during his time there. 
But he says things changed when Elon Musk took over Twitter in October. 
""People worked without worries,"" he told the BBC. ""Now we are afraid.""
Since Mr Musk acquired the company, Mr Alvarado says he was escorted by private security while cleaning parts of the office. 
He also says he was told by someone from Mr Musk's team that his job would be obsolete soon anyway because robots would eventually replace human cleaners.
Without his job, Mr Alvarado says he's worried about paying his bills. He also says he's supporting his family back in Mexico. 
""I can only tell you, I don't have money to pay the rent,"" he says. ""I'm not going to have medical insurance. I don't know what I'm going to do.""
Juana Laura Chavero Ramirez said she had worked for five years at Twitter. A diabetic, she's concerned she won't be able to get her medication. 
""It's just horrible,"" she said. ""We're not only losing our job, we're losing our income.""
Adrianna Villarreal, who had worked at Twitter since 2018, said she was worried she would not be able to afford Christmas gifts. 
""We are supposed to have Christmas presents for our children,"" she said, ""a plate of food on our table and overnight we don't have anything.""
rs say they do not know what to do - as there are few available cleaning vacancies in San Francisco at the moment.
A small group of cleaners have protested outside San Francisco's Twitter headquarters since Monday. 
California state senator Scott Wiener told the BBC the cleaners had been treated ""horribly"".
""In the short term, I'd like to see him [Elon Musk] treat his janitors like human beings,"" said Mr Wiener, ""and get them back working - not just throw them out right before Christmas.""

technology	The rise of the video game Arab hero	"A group of young people compete on consoles in an air-conditioned video game cafe on a hot summer's day. A familiar scene in many Arab cities today, as has been the case for the past two decades. 
Like many of his peers, this is how Eslam Gamal, a software engineer and a video game enthusiast, spent many hours of his youth in Cairo, Egypt - a city where pubs and bars are lacking.
For Eslam, fun was ""reaching a higher score in a game like Metal Slug or working on a mission in a First Person Shooter (FPS) game such as Counter-Strike"". Even so, it bothered Eslam that both games portrayed Arabs, including Egyptians, as terrorists and savages, ""but never enough to stop playing these games"".
Like other entertainment industries, video games have often committed the all-too-familiar mistake of perpetuating stereotypes of Arabs. 
Some adopt an older Orientalist view, in which Arab women are belly dancers and men play the flute to charm a snake or are seen atop a camel. Games such as Arabian Fight, Aladdin and the Metal Slug series are examples of this. While they are classic arcade titles, they are regaining popularity with many retro consoles on the market.
Other games, particularly FPS games, adopt the post-9/11 lens that exclusively depicts Arab characters as terrorists.
mes are changing, however. As films and TV shows adopt a more global outlook, so are video games, with better representation of Arabs beginning to be seen in mainstream titles. 
Altair Ibn-La'Ahad, the main protagonist of the Assassin's Creed series by Ubisoft, is still a Syrian assassin, but he has become an Arab hero.
Playing with an Arab character that is ""not exaggerated or ridiculous"" has transformed Eslam's gaming experience.
Eslam, stereotyping in video games ""is not only in the character design, but it is also in how the Arab cities and streets are primitive and desert-like"". Many others have a similar experience to Eslam, so Assassin's Creed quickly became popular amongst Arab gamers.
More realistic Arab representation started to appear in popular video games as large studios took notice of the promising Arab market. 
According to a report on the gaming market in Asia and the Middle East by consultants Niko Partners, the Arab video game industry was estimated at $1.7bn (£1.4bn) in 2021 with more than 65 million players. It is forecast to reach $3.12bn by 2025.
Other positive depictions of Arab characters followed Altair. Faridah Malik from the Deus Ex series is a skilled pilot and the first recognisable Arab female protagonist in a game. 
Street Fighter franchise has also introduced Rashid as ""an easy-going and laid-back person… [the] eldest son of a wealthy Middle Eastern family"", while the video game Tekken introduced Zafina, an accomplished female fighter.
In 2015, Ubisoft, the French studio behind Assassin's Creed, was not the only one tapping into the booming Arab market. 
Game studios in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan have started to emerge in the last decade as localisation became more popular. 
Assassin's Creed became the first mainstream game to be released fully localised for the Arabic audience. 
Ubisoft capitalised on the franchise's popularity in the region and co-operated with native studios to release the game with Arabic speech, subtitles and a localised user interface and menu screens.
""Localisation is not just translating a game, it is changing all aspects of a game, the objects you use, the art of the game, the food, the clothes,"" says Hossam Hammo, founder of Tamatem Games, a start-up in Amman, Jordan, that localises international video games. 
""Imagine that you play a racing game, and the road is your city,"" he says.
Mr Hammo, a video game enthusiast himself, started his company with the vision ""to contribute to the Arabic digital content that is lacking in relation to the large base of Arab users"".
Mira Karout, a game developer at Tamatem, is working on localising a new game in preparation for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. 
In keeping with traditions observed during the month, Ms Karout is adding date fruits to tables inside the game, and decorating the rooms with Islamic textiles. 
""We get a lot of positive feedback from our users, males and females, who are always happy to be better represented in the games they love,"" she says."	/news/world-middle-east-61916551
technology	Could nuclear desalination plants beat water scarcity?	"re are communities on every continent running short of water, according to the United Nations. 
Unfortunately, although our planet is swathed by oceans and seas, only a tiny fraction of Earth's water - about 2.5% - is fresh, and demand for drinking water is projected to exceed supply by trillions of cubic metres by 2030.
Desalination plants, which remove the salt from seawater, could help supply the fresh water needed.
However, these plants are considered among the most expensive ways of creating drinking water- as they pump large volumes across membranes at high pressure, which is an extremely energy intensive process.
One radical solution could be using floating vessels equipped with desalination systems. 
Powered by nuclear reactors, these vessels could travel to islands, or coastlines, struck by drought, bringing with them both clean drinking water and power.
""You could have them moving around on an intermittent basis, filling up tanks,"" says Mikal Bøe, chief executive of Core Power, which has come up with design for this type of desalination plant. 
It may sound far-fetched but the US Navy has provided desalination services during disasters in the past, with the help of its nuclear-powered ships, while Russia already has a floating nuclear power station designed to potentially power desalination facilities.
re are already around 20,000 desalination plants worldwide, almost all of which are onshore. The majority are located in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, with others in countries including the UK, China, the US, Brazil, South Africa and Australia, to name a few. 
But some engineers say it could be cheaper to position this desalination technology offshore, where the seawater can be more easily pumped aboard.
For decades, engineers have dreamed of building floating, nuclear powered desalination systems.
Core Power want to use a vessel very much like a small container ship, but stack containers on board filled with desalination technology. The nuclear reactor would then lie at the heart of this vessel providing the huge amount of power needed. 
firm's floating nuclear desalination vessels could have varying levels of power output, from five megawatts, up to around 70, Mr Bøe adds. At five megawatts of nuclear power, it could pump out 35,000 cubic metres - or 14 Olympic swimming pools' worth - of freshwater every day. 
ke the salt out of saltwater, desalination technology pushes treated seawater across a semi-permeable membrane at pressure. Osmosis, the movement of molecules in liquid across such membranes, removes the minerals, leaving freshwater and a separate, particularly salty water called brine.
re are different versions of this technology and it has become increasingly more efficient over the years. But floating desalination systems remain relatively rare.
Saudi Arabia, however, has just taken delivery of the first of three desalination barges, the largest ever built. So, can floating desalination plants take-off?
Oisann Engineering, which has developed a system called Waterfountain, hopes so.
mpany has various designs, from large ships to small buoys, but they all work on the same principle, explains chief administrative officer, Kyle Hopkins.
However, the big difference is that instead of using nuclear power, they would all use what's called subsea desalination, a decades-old technology. 
""[The technology] was never commercialised because you still need subsea pumps to facilitate taking the water to the surface,"" says Mr Hopkins. ""We removed the pump.""
He declines to elaborate as to how this works, beyond saying that the Waterfountain system as a whole takes advantage of the higher pressure on the seafloor to move water around, without incurring high energy costs.
He also mentions that the pipeline from the vessel to shore, where the freshwater must ultimately go, could be raised so that gravity can further assist the water's flow, too, cutting the need for extra power.
Mr Hopkins estimates that the technology could be, roughly, 30% more energy efficient than a traditional onshore desalination facility. The firm is currently building a miniature version of one of its designs and hopes to establish its first commercial installation in the Philippines in 2023.
Ideas such as this, and Core Power's design are ""promising"", says Raya Al-Dadah, head of the Sustainable Energy Technology Laboratory at the University of Birmingham. However, floating desalination has both advantages and disadvantages, she says. There are still challenges in terms of pumping the desalinated water ashore and in finding a workforce with both offshore experience and desalination expertise.
Ultimately, humanity needs more water resources, says Dr Al-Dadah, not least because of the expected effects of climate change, should the world experience more than 1.5C of warming. ""This will have a catastrophic impact on water,"" she says.
Referring to onshore systems, Amy Childress, at the University of Southern California, says that smaller desalination systems could help reduce the environmental impact of the technology. 
ghly salty water left after desalination is toxic to marine life and today's desalination facilities produce huge quantities of it - more brine, in fact, than freshwater. 
Mr Hopkins says that the byproduct expected from the Waterfountain system will not be salty enough to be classed as brine.
More technology of business:
most significant application of floating desalination systems could be in disaster relief, says Greg Pierce, co-director of the University of California Los Angeles Luskin Center for Innovation. 
Currently ""we're flying and trucking-in bottled water… it's the most inefficient thing possible,"" he explains, referring to the standard approach to relief efforts. ""If floating desalination can address that, I'm all for that.""
However, Dr Pierce questions whether it can be made cost-effective enough in other contexts - and notes that there are many other ways of securing clean water supplies. In California, for example, Dr Pierce estimates better water conservation measures could conserve about 30-40% of the water currently consumed in the state. 
Communities will probably also turn to measures such as water recycling or treatment of rainwater. But should this still not suffice, desalination, no matter the expense, begins to look inevitable in some parts of the world, he adds. 
For now, Core Power's design is merely that, a design. But Mr Bøe hopes that, within a decade, the firm could have a commercial system in operation. The need, he stresses, will be there."	/news/business-61483491
technology	Twitter whistleblower raises security concerns	"A former security chief for Twitter has turned whistleblower and testified that the company misled users and US regulators about gaps in its security.
Peiter Zatko also claimed that Twitter underestimated how many fake and spam accounts are on its platform.
usations could affect a legal battle between Twitter and billionaire Elon Musk, who is trying to cancel his $44bn (£37bn) deal to buy the company.
witter says Mr Zatko's allegations are inaccurate and inconsistent. 
It says he was sacked in January for ineffective leadership and poor performance.
In Mr Zatko's damning revelations, first revealed by CNN and The Washington Post, he accused Twitter of failing to maintain stringent security practices and ""lying about bots to Elon Musk"".
He filed his complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July. The BBC has seen a redacted copy of the complaint shared via CBS news.
In it, Mr Zatko also criticised the way in which Twitter handled sensitive information and claimed that it has failed to accurately report some of these matters to US regulators.
witter has faced a number of high profile hacks with Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Kanye West all targeted. 
Among his concerns Mr Zatko alleges that Twitter suffered from an usually high rate of security incidents - ""approximately one security incident each week serious enough that Twitter was required to report it to regulators"".
He said that so-called insider threats - security risks posed by people with malicious intent from within the company - went ""virtually unmonitored"".
former security chief revealed his concern about how Twitter handled data, alleging that too many employees had access to sensitive systems and user data.
He worried that the company had no workable disaster recovery plan, and claimed that in the past, Twitter had failed to properly delete the data of people who cancelled their accounts.
On fake and spam accounts, he said that ""deliberate ignorance was the norm"" at the tech company, and accused Twitter executives of having little incentive to accurately identify how many there really are on its platform.
However in the view of The Washington Post, he ""provides little hard evidence"" to back up these assertions.
Nevertheless, Elon Musk's lawyers have jumped on the comments. His legal team are currently trying to get the Tesla boss out of the deal, by arguing that Twitter has no way of verifying how many of its 229 million daily active users were actually human.
Following the publication of Mr Zatko's revelations, Mr Musk tweeted screenshots of The Washington Post's story, and tweeted an image carrying the phrase ""give a little whistle"".
Mr Zatko's lawyer told CNN that his client started the whistleblowing process before the takeover bid became public, and had not made contact with Elon Musk.
However one of Elon Musk's lawyers, Alex Spiro, told CNN that Mr Zatko had been subpoenaed to be a potential witness. 
A former hacker, Peiter Zatko is a well-known figure in computer security circles.
Nicknamed Mudge, he was a member of computer security think-tank L0pht (pronounced ""loft""), and took part in congressional hearings on cyber-security in 1998.
He has also held senior positions with Google and the US government's research and development agency, DARPA. 
A Twitter spokesperson said: ""What we've seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data-security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. 
""Mr Zatko's allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. 
""Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.""
John Tye, of Whistleblower Aid, which is assisting Pieter Zatko, described him as a ""hero"" and called on agencies to investigate the allegations quickly. "	/news/technology-62633191
technology	Tesla sales climb but miss expectations	"Supply shortages, logistics bottlenecks and rising costs are hitting Tesla as it rapidly ramps up production of its electric cars.
While the problems have improved in recent months, they remain immediate challenges, Tesla said in a financial update for investors.
Revenue was lower than expected in the three months ending in September, as car sales fell short of expectations.
But at $21.45bn (£19.12bn), it remained more than 50% higher than a year ago.
, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has been growing aggressively in recent years, opening new factories in the US, China and Germany and boosting output. 
mpany delivered 343,000 cars in the quarter - a record that was up more than 40% from the same period last year. 
firm produced more cars than were sold, raising fears that demand may be slowing, as rising prices, higher borrowing costs and a major economic slowdown in the key China market discourage buyers.
Mr Musk conceded there was weakness in China but beat back suggestions that demand was cooling.
When Tesla shared the delivery figures earlier this month, the company said the gap was due to difficulty finding vehicles to transport cars to customers. 
""There weren't enough boats, there weren't enough trains there weren't enough car carriers,"" he said on a conference call to discuss the results, adding that the firm expects to sell every car it makes. 
Deliveries of its own much anticipated electric truck are due to start in December, the firm said. The company reported $3.3bn in profit, up significantly from a year ago.
But questions about Tesla's growth path, as well as billions of dollars in stock sales by Mr Musk as he prepares a $44bn takeover of Twitter, have weighed on the company's shares in recent months.
re price has dropped 40% this year, wiping billions of dollars off the company's value. Its shares fell a further 4% in after-market trading on Wednesday. 
""I think Tesla's had a hard quarter and the market is responding to that,"" Sarah Kunst, managing director of Cleo Capital, told the BBC's Today programme.
""The auto industry in general right now is having a very hard time because supply chain problems persist and the batteries - particularly for electric vehicles - are hard to come by,"" she said.
""And the reality is that Tesla used to be the only place to go to buy a higher-end electric car and that's increasingly not the case.""

In the US, rivals have also been ramping up their efforts. 
German carmaker BMW said on Wednesday that it would spend $1.7bn to expand its electric vehicle production in the US. 
A few months ago Elon Musk - no shrinking violet when it comes to self-promotion - said demand for Teslas was through the roof.
""Right now demand is exceeding production to a ridiculous degree,"" he said. 
And yet from these figures, that doesn't seem to be happening. 
In fact Tesla is making more cars than it's selling. 
Not only that, but there are a series of financial pressures eating away at profitability. Supply chain issues and the costs of raw materials are hurting profits. 
rs are much more concerned about its long-term potential than short term financial pressures though. 
's why the uncertainty about demand for Teslas is particularly damaging. It helps to explain why a seemingly solid set of results has seen a fall in Tesla's share price. 
It also explains why Mr Musk looked to kibosh talk of demand issues on the earnings call. ""I can't emphasise enough we have excellent demand for [the fourth quarter] and we expect to sell every car we can make as far in the future as we can see,"" he said.
However, many Tesla investors worry that Mr Musk isn't spending enough time on the company - after committing to buy Twitter. These results won't likely change that view. "	/news/business-63319011
technology	Medical supplies drone trial takes off in Tayside	"A drone collection and delivery service transporting medical samples and equipment between health centres is being trialled in Tayside.
flight will carry equipment from the grounds of Stracathro Hospital, Brechin, to Invergowrie, near Dundee's Ninewells Hospital.
It is hoped the service could be adopted by NHS Tayside in the future to reduce transport times.
rvice is being trialled by the health board and Mercury Drone Ports.
rial route has been approved by the Federal Aviation Authority.
Future trials will carry supplies and samples between other healthcare facilities in Dundee and Angus.
Angus Council leader Beth Whiteside said she hoped the trial would demonstrate how it could help reduce testing times and speed up diagnoses for patients.
NHS Tayside said it hoped the trial would help develop and improve its supply chain, and provide an equitable level of healthcare, regardless of a patient's geographical location.
Chris Hind, the health board's diagnostics laboratories interim quality manager, said: ""NHS Tayside plans to extend phlebotomy testing hours at some regional medical practices. 
""We are very interested in testing additional logistical support to transport patient samples, which would permit samples to be taken at later times than currently possible for delivery to the main testing lab at Ninewells Hospital.""   
Mercury Drone Ports is a public-private partnership between Angus Council and drone company DTLX.
It is providing a trial airspace area to allow other drone firms and their clients to conduct test flights.
It is being funded from the UK government's £26.5m Angus Fund, as part of the Tay Cities Region Deal."	/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-63075005
technology	No more airplane mode? EU to allow calls on flights	"Airline passengers in the European Union (EU) will soon be able to use their phones to full effect in the sky.
European Commission ruled airlines can provide 5G technology on board planes, alongside slower mobile data.

for member states to make the 5G frequency bands available for planes is 30 June 2023.

rry Breton, EU Commissioner for the Internal Market, said the plan would ""enable innovative services for people"" and help European companies grow. 
""The sky is no longer a limit when it comes to possibilities offered by super-fast, high-capacity connectivity,"" he said.
EU Commission has reserved certain frequency bands for aircraft since 2008, allowing some services to offer mid-air internet access.
But this service has been historically slow, as it relied on equipment to connect people via a satellite between the aeroplane and the ground.

Dai Whittingham, chief executive of the UK Flight Safety Committee, told the BBC that airplane mode was historically important due to a lack of knowledge about how mobile devices affect aircraft.
""There was a concern they could interfere with automatic flight control systems,"" he said. 
""What has been found with experience is the risk of interference is very small. The recommendation has always been that once you are in flight, devices should be in in airplane mode.""
re has been a concern in the US that 5G frequencies could interfere with flights, and even potentially lead to erroneous altitude measurements.
But Mr Whittingham said this is not an issue in the UK and the EU.
""There is much less prospect of interference,"" he said, ""We have a different set of frequencies for 5G, and there are lower power settings than those that have been allowed in the US.
""The travelling public wants 5G. The regulators will open up that possibility, but there will be steps that will be taken to ensure that whatever they do is safe.""
Glenn Bradley, Head of Flight Operations at the UK Civil Aviation Authority - the regulator responsible for the safety of aircraft within the UK - said the use of mobile phones to make calls is prohibited on UK airlines, unless the aircraft has been ""equipped with an approved mobile phone control system"".
""We understand that plans to enable 5G onboard flights will operate in the higher frequency bands and therefore won't interfere with aircraft systems,"" he said.
""We stand ready to work with the industry to assist the delivery of this innovation."""	/news/technology-63786591
technology	Activision Blizzard: US seeks to block Microsoft's $69bn acquisition	"US is entering a legal battle with Xbox-maker Microsoft to block its plan to purchase the gaming firm behind hit titles such as Call of Duty.
Regulators cited competition concerns, saying they feared that if the deal went through, Activision Blizzard's games would stop being offered on non-Microsoft gaming consoles.
Activision purchase was set to be the biggest in Microsoft history.
mpany said it would fight to complete the $69bn (£56bn) deal.
Microsoft president Brad Smith said the company had ""complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court"".
mplaint against Microsoft is among the most-high profile legal fights to emerge from US President Joe Biden's pledge to take a harder line against monopolies.
ready raised concerns in other countries, including the UK.
Activision Blizzard owns some of the most popular games in the world, including the Call of Duty series, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Candy Crush.
Federal Trade Commission, the US consumer watchdog that filed the complaint, said that Activision was one of a small number of top video game developers that made high-quality games for multiple devices.
would give Microsoft ""both the means and motive to harm competition"" by manipulating pricing, making games worse on its competitors' video game consoles, ""or withholding content from competitors entirely, resulting in harm to consumers,"" the agency said in a press release.
FTC pointed to Microsoft's acquisition of ZeniMax, which owns video game studio Bethesda Softworks. Microsoft has said several of the studio's future games will be exclusive to Microsoft consoles.
Microsoft earlier this week said it had agreed to make Call of Duty available on Nintendo for 10 years if the purchase went through and made a similar offer to rival Sony.
""This sounds alarming, so I want to reinforce my confidence that this deal will close,"" Activision Blizzard chief executive Bobby Kotick wrote in a letter to staff that was shared on the company's website. ""The allegation that this deal is anti-competitive doesn't align with the facts, and we believe we'll win this challenge.""
Content is king, or so the saying goes.
Historically, you would choose which games to buy depending on which bit of hardware you owned - whether that was a Nintendo, Sony, Sega (remember them?) or Microsoft. Back then you could argue consoles were king. 
But in recent years more and more big titles like Fifa, Call of Duty and Fortnite offer the same experience on multiple platforms, making the device you own less of a fundamental issue to accessing the games you love.
r content - with big companies like Tencent, Microsoft and Sony buying up games developers to try and make sure they are offering something unique in such a competitive marketplace.
What's different here is the sheer scale of the purchase and the massive mainstream appeal of the games under discussion. 
Given everything that has been said publicly by Microsoft and Activision it is unlikely that should this deal go through it would mean that one day in the near future PlayStation users would be unable to play the latest Call of Duty. 
However, it could mean that people who pay for Microsoft's GamePass get the game first, as part of the subscription price or have some bespoke content unique to them. 
PlayStation and now the FTC claim that this in and of itself is enough to distort the market. Microsoft argues it boosts player choice.
Now it is up to a judge to decide. 
When it announced the deal, Microsoft said it was aiming to expand the games available on GamePass, its Netflix-style subscription gaming service and for the increasing number of people using phones to play games.
keover was set to make the company the third largest gaming firm in the world by revenue, behind China's Tencent and Japan's Sony, which owns PlayStation and has criticised the deal. 
It could be forced to pay a breakup fee of as much as $3bn if the deal fails.
FTC chair Lina Khan, who made her name critiquing the US government's historic failures to rein in Big Tech, and two Democratic commissioners voted in favour of filing the lawsuit. The Republican commissioner opposed the move."	/news/business-63911557
technology	A social media murder: Olly’s story	"It was only after Olly Stephens was murdered, in a field outside his home in Reading, that his mum and dad realised the violent and disturbing world their son had been exposed to through his phone. For BBC Panorama, reporter Marianna Spring investigates the role social media played in his death and exposes how a 13-year-old's social media accounts can be recommended violent videos and knives for sale. 
Last January, Amanda and Stuart Stephens watched their son from separate windows as he left home, not realising it would be the last time. Olly wandered over to a field, Bugs Bottom, opposite their house - sliders on his feet, his phone in hand. 
Fifteen minutes later, he had been murdered. 
was holding would provide the answers to what had happened.
Olly was stabbed to death by two teenage boys in a field behind his house, after they recruited a girl online to lure him there. The entire attack had been planned on social media and triggered by a dispute in a social media chat group. 
His parents were shocked to discover the murky world of violence and hate that their son and his friends had inhabited through their phones. 
I decided to investigate the role social media played in what happened to Olly - and what 13-year-olds like him are being exposed to.
""They hunted him, tracked him and executed him through social media,"" Stuart tells me as we sit together on their sofa in their home in Reading.
""Social media is not guilty of the murder, but it did nothing to protect him, and without it he'd still be here."" 
mes Valley Police say Olly's story stands out because of the huge role social media played in the case. And they fear that the evidence of bullying, and violent videos featuring knives found on the killers' phones, is just ""the tip of a very large iceberg"". 
I set out to uncover what young teenagers are seeing on social media by creating a fake account as a 13-year-old on five social media sites popular with that age group.
Using an AI-generated photograph, we set up accounts for a 13-year-old boy, consulting one of Olly's friends and public accounts belonging to young teenagers in Reading. We wanted to see what a 13-year-old engaging with popular topics for his age - from sport and gaming to drill music and anti-knife crime content - would be exposed to and recommended. 
We also wanted to test whether social media sites moderate videos and images of knives similar to those shared by the children convicted of murdering Olly.
After running our dummy account experiment for two weeks, with it liking and following content suggested across the social media sites, as well as his original interests - the results were striking:
When Olly left the house that day he reassured Amanda he had his phone location switched on, so she'd know where he was. It was the Sunday after Christmas, and the family were preparing to go back to work and school the next day. Amanda expected Olly back before dark.
But shortly after he left home there was a knock on the door. It was a boy Olly knew. Amanda couldn't quite take in what he was saying. 
""I thought, 'Did he just say Olly's been stabbed?'"" 
Stuart and Olly's older sister dashed out to the field opposite their home, where Olly was lying in a pool of blood. Amanda followed after them. 
""I just held his hand and asked him not to leave me,"" Stuart says. 
Friends, neighbours, dog walkers all tried to help, but it was too late. He died in that field. 
""I still look for his feet in the morning at the end of the bed because they would hang over the end,"" Stuart says. Not seeing them there hits him every time.
Olly's bed is still made up with his favourite duvet cover. Amanda still buys him sweets, and when she vacuums Olly's room - something he used to hate - she still mutters, ""I'll only be a minute."" 
Just before he was murdered, Olly had been diagnosed with autism and, at that time, he most enjoyed gaming and listening to music in his bedroom.
ght after his murder, looking through social media posts about Olly and screengrabs his friends shared with their daughter, Stuart and Amanda began to realise the role social media had played in what happened.
""It's this secret world where you can do and say exactly what you want,"" Amanda says. ""It was a world that we had no idea existed [and] that he was being attacked by it."" 
Amanda, who would normally use the tracker on Olly's phone to make sure he made it home safely, now found herself using it to check his phone made it into the hands of the police. She followed the signal as it travelled with Olly's body to hospital and then again when it was taken to Thames Valley police station.
Detective Chief Inspector Andy Howard was tasked with investigating the world inside that phone. It's a case he describes as unprecedented because 90% of the evidence at Olly's murder trial came from mobile phones - and no child witnesses had to take the stand. 
""We were really taken aback by the amount of digital evidence,"" he explains. 
re was enough to convict two boys - aged 13 and 14 at the time - of murder last November. The 13-year-old girl who led him to the park was convicted of manslaughter. 
Watch Panorama - A Social Media Murder: Olly's Story at 8pm on BBC One
What struck the police initially about the mountain of videos, photos and screengrabs they began to sift through was the persona that 13- and 14-year-olds linked to the case were presenting online, so at odds with the suburban reality they were living. 
re were images shared on Instagram of people holding knives, with balaclavas on and hoods up. 
found videos of knives being flicked and shown off, and of boys linked to Olly's murder attacking one another, which DCI Howard told Panorama he believes were being shared ""openly and very regularly"" on Instagram and Snapchat. 
""There is certainly a very unhealthy attraction to filming, recording, acts of really quite serious violence,"" DCI Andy Howard says. 
It was a video posted on Snapchat showing an attack called ""patterning"" that was the catalyst in a chain of events that led to Olly losing his life.  
mes Valley Police explained that patterning is the humiliation of a young person which is filmed or photographed and then shared on social media. It's forwarded on and on, shared across different social media sites, multiplying the embarrassment for the victim. 
In the weeks before he was killed, Olly had seen an image of a younger boy being humiliated and tried to alert the boy's older brother by forwarding it on to him. 
When two boys who were in a Snapchat group with Olly became aware he had passed it on, they were furious. 
DCI Howard says those boys thought Olly had been ""snitching, grassing on them"", and that led to the fallout. 
Police also found hundreds of Snapchat voice notes from the two boys who fell out with Olly. In them, they discuss attacking Olly and try to recruit a girl to set him up.
13-year-old girl who agreed to do this knew Olly in real life, and had met the two boys involved online. Although they all lived locally, they met for the first time on the day of the murder. 
guage those convicted used in the voice notes is shocking, with comments like, ""You're going to die tomorrow Olly,"" and ""I'll just give him bangs [hit him] or stab him."" What's also chilling is their casual and cold tone. 
In one voice note, the girl says, ""[Male 2] wants me to set him up so then [Male 2] is gonna bang him and pattern him and shit. I'm so excited you don't understand."" 
None of these voice notes appear to have been picked up by Snapchat - and under the social media app's own policy, it's not possible to report a private message or voice note like this to the site, only the account sending it. 
gathered by the police is just the information required to prosecute - but DCI Andy Howard fears they have only scratched the surface in this case. In his view, it's likely those involved were regularly exposed to violent content - and desensitised to it.  
A recent study by the Huddersfield University's Applied Criminology and Policing Centre backs up that idea, finding that social media was a key factor in almost a quarter of crimes committed by under-18s. Most of these were acts of violence that started with confrontation online. 
In our own investigation, within two weeks of following the kind of content 13-year-olds in Reading follow on their accounts, our imaginary teenager was recommended posts of people showing off knives, knives for sale and videos glorifying violence. 
Instagram, Facebook and YouTube - while on TikTok and Snapchat, the accounts were not recommended this kind of content.
All of these social media sites say that they protect teenage users. 
Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, says it restricts what under-18s can see of ""content that attempts to buy or sell bladed weapons"". 
YouTube says it ""may add an age restriction"" to content that includes ""harmful or dangerous acts that minors could imitate"". Our account only encountered one video with an age restriction.
Some of the images and videos of knives were similar to those found on the phones of Olly's killers. We wanted to test what happens when a 13-year-old shares a post like that on social media. 
Our fake accounts were private, so as not to expose anyone else to this image and video of a knife. 
No action was taken against the post showing off a knife that was shared on the 13-year-old's account on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat. 
k Tok, however, did remove the post for violating its guidelines on dangerous acts - and the account was warned that it was close to being suspended. That suggests it is possible to detect and remove this type of content shared by a profile under 18. We have now deactivated the accounts. 
Our experiment revealed something else striking. Some adverts being promoted to the account on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram were based on his interests and, at times, age-appropriate. That seems to suggest that data from young teenage users can be used to target them - but then isn't being used to protect them from harmful content showing knives and violence. 
I wanted to know if the posts pushed to the 13-year-old's account were typical of what teenagers would see so I met up with Olly's friends Poppy, Patrick, Izzy, Jacob and Ben at Olly's memorial bench, metres from where he was stabbed. 
Ben had helped me set up the fake account. He and Olly's other friends told me they started using social media long before they turned 13, the age you have to be to sign up to most of the platforms. They all say there were no attempts to verify their ages. Olly's parents say he, too, joined them before he was 13. 
I showed them several screen grabs from the accounts, without exposing them to too much of the content we've been recommended. But the children weren't shocked by the results at all - and admitted they all see knives and violence regularly on their social media feeds. 
""I've seen bigger knives to be honest,"" Jacob says of his own social media accounts.  
""We get exposed more to people kind of showing [them] off,"" Poppy explains, talking about the image people her age try to portray mainly on Instagram, as well as Snapchat. 
Ben has seen Rambo knives, and Izzy butterfly blades, which she thinks people share because they are colourful and more appealing. 
ribe being exposed to cyberbullying on a regular basis - including ""patterning"" - humiliation videos like the one that triggered the dispute between Olly and the boys who killed him.
All of the social media sites expressed their sympathies to Olly's family. Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, says that they ""don't allow content that threatens, encourages or coordinates violence"" and that they have ""a well-established process to support police investigations"" as they did in Olly's case. They ""will urgently investigate the examples raised in this investigation"". 
YouTube says it has ""strict existing policies in place to ensure that our platform is not used to incite violence"". 
kTok says ""There is no such thing as 'job done' when it comes to protecting our users, particularly young people"" and it will ""continue to build policies and tools"" to help teens and their parents stay safe online. 
Snapchat says they ""strictly prohibit bullying, harassment and any illegal activity"" and ""provide confidential in-app reporting tools"" on the site. 
Amanda and Stuart want answers - and solutions - to protect other 13-year-olds on social media, and they want legislators to listen.
fety bill is currently passing through Parliament. ""This bill is about keeping children and young people safe,"" Secretary of State Nadine Dorries tells me. 
She wasn't shocked to see the results of our experiment. ""These platforms know that knife content is being sent to young people's social media feeds,"" she says. ""They can actually put what is wrong right now.""
Stuart and Amanda fear that the bill in its current form wouldn't have saved Olly. They want to see more done to verify the age of young users and to limit their exposure to harmful posts - even if the content might be legal, like the violent videos and images of knives our dummy account was recommended. 
Dorries says exactly what is considered harmful but legal will be specified soon. 
But how exactly could the bill force social media sites to address this?
""I think it's probably easier to keep to the core principle of the bill,"" Dorries says. ""The UK has to be the safest country in the world for children and young people to be online."" 
Government is promising harsh penalties if companies don't comply. 
""We will have the power to issue multi-billion pound fines and make sure that people within those organisations are criminally liable,"" says Dorries.
Meanwhile, Amanda says she feels social media companies are not facing up to the reality of what's happening. 
""Forget your profits, kids are killing each other,"" Stuart says."	/news/uk-61813959
technology	Twitter: Romance, business and campaigns born on the platform	"For those who work there and those who use it, Twitter continues to be on a rollercoaster under the leadership of Elon Musk, who bought the firm for $44bn (£36.3m) at the end of October.
umult has brought into sharper focus some of the platform's failings. Like all social networks, Twitter has long grappled with problems regarding privacy, hate speech and abuse.
But for some of its roughly 300 million monthly users, it has also been a place where they have built businesses, found love, launched campaigns and raised awareness for issues that are important to them.
I spoke to three women who say being on Twitter changed their lives for the better.
Catherine Cooke is a teaching assistant 
I didn't start out looking for romance. But what I did use Twitter for was support, it's quite an isolating thing going through a divorce. And you can of course talk to real-life friends and family, but sometimes they're a little bit too close. Sometimes it's just very useful to have a sounding board. 
You can have a vent and a rant. And there's somebody there who will either be sympathetic or maybe tell you off, but you will definitely get a reaction, and probably some quite honest feedback as well. I started off really using Twitter as a bit of a diary.
Along the way, I found lots of people who were going through the same thing or had been through the same thing, and had useful information or advice.
As far as the romance side of it goes, really that came out of friendships I'd made on Twitter. I like music and I got chatting to people about it. One of those people eventually ended up being my partner. But it did start out in friendship, a shared love of music and general chit-chat.
I love Twitter. There's so many people out there that I feel very, very strongly about even though we've never met, which does sound a bit weird. Online friends are a different sort of friend from real-life friends, but they're really important. I feel like I couldn't have got through the last couple of years without those people. I'm very positive about Twitter, I think it can be an absolute force for good.
witter has changed my life, I can't believe I'm actually saying that but it's true. I've gone from being on my own and going through divorce, to feeling that I've met the love of my life. I would never have met him if it hadn't been for Twitter. I feel really, really lucky.
Gail Myerscough is an illustrator and pattern designer
witter has been amazing. I've got 18,400 followers, so I've got a real audience for my work. But it's also been really supportive. People have been with me on my journey. I was made redundant in Covid - this was my side hustle and then it became my full-time job. I also met my husband on Twitter. 
I've got brand ambassadors now on Twitter who retweet me, I've got repeat customers. I've worked with some amazing people. Tim Burgess from the band The Charlatans contacted me one day and said, ""I really like your work"". And then he asked me to design a turntable for him. So we designed a limited-edition turntable - it was brilliant.
I get a lot of traffic from Twitter.  I do have Instagram, but the algorithms and engagement make it more difficult to get people to look at your work.
I'm really worried about what's happening [since Elon Musk took over] because like I say, a lot of my business and support comes from Twitter. If Twitter went, I'd have to build my business elsewhere, and I don't know where that would be to get the same engagement and orders. 
Suw Charman-Anderson founded Ada Lovelace Day, an annual celebration of women working in Stem (science, tech, engineering and maths)
I started the Ada Lovelace Day Twitter account at the end of 2008. And at that point, the idea of having a day celebrating women in Stem - well it was just an idea. I didn't have any resources or any way to reach people. Twitter was the obvious solution. In all honesty, I don't think Ada Lovelace Day would have become the movement that it did without the help of Twitter.
We have 40% of our audience in the UK, and about 40% in North America. The other 20% is in about 150 countries around the world. So we have followers from across South America, Africa, Asia, it has allowed us to reach people in countries where the media isn't going to pick us up.
With a bit of care, it has been possible to curate an experience on Twitter that is generally pleasant. Obviously, there is always the opportunity for things to go wrong. I have experienced the Twitter pile-on - not quite becoming the main character thankfully, but adjacent to it - and that is never pleasant. 
But overall, I think it has been a positive experience for me and I am grateful to Twitter for allowing Ada Lovelace Day to flourish in the way that it has. I see other organisations for women in Stem and all sorts of other things that exist because Twitter connects them with their community and their audience in a way that other tools just don't. 
I just don't see the same level of engagement on Facebook or LinkedIn for example. I think Twitter is interesting, it's unique in its properties, and I would be really heartbroken if it did break permanently or if we saw a huge drop off in numbers.

technology	Stalking fears over PimEyes facial search engine	"Privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch has made a complaint against face recognition search engine PimEyes.
PimEyes enables people to look for faces in images which have been posted publicly on the internet.
Big Brother Watch claims it facilitates stalking and has complained to the UK data and privacy watchdog.
But PimEyes' chief executive Giorgi Gobronidze says it poses fewer risks related to stalking than social media or other search engines.
Mr Gobronidze told the BBC that because PimEyes only searches images posted publicly anyone misusing it ""gets only the information available on the open internet"".
Big Brother Watch's complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) claims that PimEyes has enabled ""surveillance and stalking on a scale previously unimaginable"".
Starting with a person's picture, PimEyes finds other photos of them published online. This could include images on photo-sharing sites, in blog posts and news articles, and on websites. 
Big Brother Watch says that by piecing together information associated with these images - for example the text of a blog post, or a photo on a workplace website - a stalker could work out a person's ""place of work, or indications of the area in which they live"".
""Images of anyone, including children, can be scoured and tracked across the internet,"" wrote Madeleine Stone, legal and policy officer at Big Brother Watch, as she announced the complaint.
She argued the tool could be secretly used by potential employers, university admissions officers, domestic abusers or stalkers, and said it threatened to ""end anonymity as we know it"".
mpaigners accuse PimEyes of unlawfully processing the biometric data of millions of UK citizens - arguing it does not obtain permission from those whose images are analysed. 
However, PimEyes told the BBC it was technically impossible to tell how many UK citizens' faces it has analysed. 
Mr Gobronidze also responded to accusations his search engine broke data protection law. He claimed it was ""technically impossible to reconstruct a single photo"" from the data the company held, ""even if we put our entire database on the open web"".
make full use of PimEyes, users need to take out one of three types of paid subscription.
In its terms and conditions, the site says it is intended to allow people to search for publicly available information about themselves. 
""PimEyes is not intended for the surveillance of others and is not designed for that purpose,"" it says.
But Big Brother Watch claims there are no safeguards against this. There has also been concern that the tool could be used to uncover the real identity of sex workers.
However Mr Gobronidze claims that PimEye's ""data security unit"" looks for suspicious activity, for example if a male user always looks for female individuals, or a user uploads a photo of a child.
And the site does allow people to opt out of their image appearing in results.
mpany argues that there are positive uses of the tool, telling the BBC that it:
However, another face recognition search engine has found itself in legal hot water. 
ClearviewAI's tool is not usable by the general public, and the firm says it is only available to law enforcement. Nonetheless it faced a £7.5m fine from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).
Responding to Big Brother Watch's call for an investigation the ICO said ""We are aware of this matter and we are assessing the information provided."""	/news/technology-63544169
technology	Microsoft launches simulator to train drone AI systems	"Microsoft has launched a platform to train the artificial intelligence (AI) systems of autonomous aircraft.
Project AirSim is, in effect, a flight simulator for drones, which companies can use to train and develop software controlling them.
It makes it possible for test flights in places that would be too risky in reality, such as near power lines.
And it means, Microsoft says, that millions of flights can be simulated in seconds.
For example, companies can virtually see how the vehicle flies in rain, or how strong winds might affect its battery life.
In a statement announcing the launch, Microsoft's Gurdeep Pall said that it showed ""the power of the industrial metaverse - the virtual worlds where businesses will build, test and hone solutions, and then bring them into the real world"".
firm envisages the tech being used to train the AI systems which fly autonomous air vehicles from air taxis to delivery drones.
Seattle software giant has a long history in virtual flight - this November its Flight Simulator game will celebrate its 40th anniversary.
Project AirSim's history is more recent, growing out of an open-source project of the same name that was used by a number of researchers.
Microsoft has announced that it will retire that project.
Users will still have access to the original open-source project's code, the company told the BBC, but it will be archived, and instead the firm will focus its efforts on the new product.
w proprietary platform, the company says, contains more out-of-the box features, and requires less technical knowledge to use.
However, Microsoft says its goal is to offer a free option, and says it will provide more information as the general release date approaches.
roject runs on Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure. 
US firm Airtonomy was given early access to the platform. 
Airtonomy uses drones to inspect infrastructure, such as wind turbines and power lines. 
Chief executive Josh Riedy told the BBC that previously a ""crew of three individuals rappelled down those blades - the towers are at a height of 80m (262 ft), so not only was it a nearly a day-long job for three individuals, safety is certainly a consideration"".
Now the drones fly autonomously and can be controlled by only one person on the ground. ""They simply need to know how to put batteries in a drone, and push a button,"" he said. 
flight routines that enable this are developed in the virtual environment of Project AirSim, and Mr Riedy says a big advantage is the ""simulated environment allows us to make mistakes"" when working with critical infrastructure.
It also allows developers to imagine ""what if"" scenarios that would be unsafe to test in real life - such as what happens if a drone's vision is obscured.
Microsoft hopes that it could also be used by civil aviation regulators to test systems - seeing how the drone performs in extremely heavy rain, or copes with a loss of positioning data. 
As well as libraries of digital environments, developers will also have to access already trained AI ""building blocks"" which the firm hopes will reduce the expertise needed to develop systems.
Ashish Kapoor, creator of the original open-source AirSim, said in a statement that he hoped data gathered on the new platform would help put ""many more vehicles in the sky, helping to monitor farms, inspect critical infrastructure and transport goods and people to the remotest of places"".

technology	Police text 70,000 victims in UK's biggest anti-fraud operation	"Detectives have begun contacting 70,000 people suspected of being victims of a sophisticated banking scam.
Metropolitan Police is sending text messages to mobile phone users it believes spoke with fraudsters pretending to be their bank.
Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley described an ""enormous endeavour"" in gathering evidence after the discovery of an online fraud network.
re have been more than 100 arrests so far, and one man has been charged.
People who receive a text message in the next 24 hours will be directed to the Action Fraud website to register their details as officers build cases against suspects.
Sir Mark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Met was contacting mobile numbers that were connected to the fraudsters for longer than a minute, suggesting a fraud or attempted fraud had taken place.
m involved fraudsters calling people at random, pretending to be a bank and warning of suspicious activity on their account.
would pose as employees of banks including Barclays, Santander, HSBC, Lloyds, Halifax, First Direct, NatWest, Nationwide and TSB.
fraudsters would then encourage people to disclose security information and, through technology, they may have accessed features such as one-time passcodes to clear accounts of funds.
As many as 200,000 people in the UK may have been victims of the scam, police said, with victims losing thousands of pounds, and in one case £3m.
70,000 people being contacted are connected to calls made by individuals known to police, Sir Mark said, and their evidence could be used to prosecute cases.
Genuine messages from police will be sent on Thursday or Friday, detectives said. They said the messages would direct victims to the Metropolitan Police website which would ask people to register with Action Fraud. Any other texts should be regarded as fraudulent themselves.
mammoth cyber fraud operation began when police in the Netherlands bugged a website that allowed fraudsters to make anonymous phone calls from spoof numbers, posing as bank employees.
Spoof website, which has since been taken down by the FBI, crucially allowed scammers to access one-time passcodes and passwords, detectives said. 
One-time codes, often delivered through text messages, have become a standard security measure for most online banks in recent years.
Det Supt Helen Rance, from the Met's Cyber Crime unit, said victims would not have known the phone call was coming from iSpoof.
""The person on the other end of the line can be very convincing,"" she said.
""This is an absolutely devastating crime for so many people. They must be worried, I really feel for them,"" she said.
Fraudsters paid between £150 and £5,000 a month in bitcoin to use the iSpoof service, contacting, at times, 20 people a minute, primarily in the USA, UK, Netherlands, Australia, France and Ireland.
So far, police believe £48m may have been stolen by criminals using iSpoof. This figure is likely to rise. Those behind the service are allegedly earning £3.2m and living ""lavish"" lifestyles.
A notice on the website says that it has been taken down by the FBI.
Det Supt Rance said the investigation remained active.
Police believe 59,000 potential suspects may have used the iSpoof service, but are prioritising those in the UK who have spent at least 100 Bitcoin to get access, believing they were anonymous.
Early in November they raided an address in east London and arrested a man alleged to be behind iSpoof.
In other raids, 120 people thought to have used the service for fraud have been taken into custody.
Det Supt Rance warned other criminal ""enablers"" will have taken over to provide services to fraudsters.
""Undoubtedly they will go to another website,"" she said. 
A 34-year-old man, Teejai Fletcher, has been charged with making or supplying articles for use in fraud and participating in the activities of an organised crime group.
He will appear at Southwark Crown Court on 6 December.
Call your bank directly, checking its website for the correct number to ring. If the fraud involved any of your personal information, consider signing up for a Protective Registration with fraud prevention organisation Cifas, which costs £25 for two years.
Change your passwords for any accounts that have been compromised due to fraud - and any that use the same password. Set up two-factor authentication wherever possible to provide another layer of protection.
Being scammed can take a huge toll on mental health. Mind and Victim Support have confidential helplines that provide support to consumers who have been hit.

technology	Are we falling in love with robots?	"It's a fiercely hot afternoon in Milton Keynes and I'm chasing a small orange flag as it waggles just above a line of low garden walls. The flag is attached to a white robot with six wheels and I'm relieved to see that it's slowing down to a halt. 
Cristiane Bonifacio has just extracted a large chocolate bar from the robot that has rolled up outside her home. Ms Bonifacio is in a hurry and has to dash back indoors for a work Zoom call, but she's got just enough time to express her affection for the robot delivery service that sends these machines scuttling along her local pavements.
""I love the robots. Sometimes you find one that's got stuck so you help it and it says 'thank you'.""
robot delivery service from Starship Technologies was launched in Milton Keynes four years ago and has been steadily expanding ever since, with further towns added just last month.
After decades of playing the villain in science fiction, robots are now part of life in many towns and people haven't just embraced them, they rush to assist them. What is going on?
Amber Case is an Oregon-based specialist in human-robot interaction and the way technology changes everyday life. ""In the movies robots are always a technology that's attacking us. But the delivery robots wait for us and we use them."" 
She thinks occasions when a robot hits an obstacle and requires help from a passer-by are a crucial part of the human-robot relationship. ""Technology can be adorable if it needs our assistance. We like a robot that needs us a bit, and when we help the robot it creates a bond."" 
Curiously, Ms Case is critical of the Starship Technologies delivery robots that pepper the pavements of Milton Keynes. 
re battery-powered, summoned and opened by an app, equipped with sensors to detect pedestrians and armed with a speaker. This allows a remote human operator to address people observed through on-board video cameras. 
Yet this arsenal of tech is not being applied correctly, she says. ""I feel they are automating the wrong part of the journey. Humans are really good at negotiating terrain and finding a particular house. Is this just a fetish for automating things?""
Despite these reservations she concedes that ""the Starship team have gone about it the right way, understanding how to make sure it's not scary, but cute. It seems they think more about the design than some robot makers and a well-designed robot is more likely to succeed."" 
gn element of the Starship robot chimes with the public. Victoria Butterworth recalls that the robots were one reason she moved to Milton Keynes. 
""They caught my attention, they're so quirky and original.""
She adds that ""of course there were lots of other reasons to move here"", but the robots came to play an important part in her life when her dachshund developed disc displacement and needed constant attention. 
robots allowed her to care for the dog without leaving her home to shop. ""They were a real godsend when the dog was ill."" 
uman-robot bond emerging in Milton Keynes has banished the stereotype of a menacing robot, she says.
""When you see one you don't get that science-fiction emotion of 'Oh No! It's a robot!' It's more like a cute little character you see on the street. It makes your walk more colourful.""   
Andy Curtis, Starship's UK operations manager who is in charge of 180 robots in Milton Keynes, talks about each machine operating in a ""bubble of awareness"" that allows it to alert people to its presence and offer thanks if they assist it. ""It's designed to be cute, not to be invasive.""
gentle demeanour is more than incidental. It pays off, says Mr Curtis. ""People will jump in if a robot struggles on a difficult surface and it plays back a thank you message."" 
More technology of business:
In Starship's native Estonia, pedestrians come to the rescue when robots encounter snow and ice on the streets of Tallinn, pulling them onto the pavement to be repaid with that popular voice of thanks.  
Adam Rang, a businessman in Tallinn, confesses to being excited by the robots. But it's not an emotion his two-year-old son shares. ""I point them out to him but he doesn't care. He's more interested in buses. It shows how normal they are to people born today, even though we've been waiting all our lives for robots like the ones promised in science fiction.""
He adds that drivers in Tallinn are accustomed to halting at pedestrian crossings to let the robots pass over, even though Estonian traffic law does not afford them pedestrian rights. 
He believes that part of our affection for the robots stems from disappointment with a promised future that didn't appear. ""A lot of science fiction predictions didn't work out. But the robots give us the future we were promised."" 
Back in Milton Keynes the robots queue up outside Moores Fish & Chips on a Friday night. Co-owner Johnny Pereira explains why this mix of traditional and hi-tech has proved a hit with his regular customers and bedded in with the locals. 
""Parents like to order robot-delivered fish and chips for the family, it's popular with kids. It's definitely increased business. But I can spot when customers sitting outside are new to Milton Keynes - they stare at the robots! People who live here are used to them.""  
At the local robot hub beside a mini-supermarket the little machines line up on the pavement, waiting for their next order. 
Stephanie Daniels and her son, Noah, have dropped by and they too are impressed by robotic good manners. ""I like it, they're very innovative, they have very good sensors. They're very cool and very weird at the same time. And they say 'Thank you!'"" "	/news/business-62007675
technology	TikTok: Welsh speakers use social media to teach others	"Welsh speakers are turning to TikTok to promote the language and teach it to others.
media platform is helping to connect lovers of the language with new learners.
""I think the one thing with TikTok that's different is the videos are short and sweet. You're able to engage with people,"" said one creator.
It comes as recent census data shows that there is a decline in Welsh speakers.
Bethany Davies from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, has about 44,000 TikTok followers and has made a career out of sharing the Welsh language and culture.
23-year-old history graduate grew up speaking Welsh, and says she feels ""privileged"" not to have known life without it. 
""I am one of five children and when my two eldest siblings were young, [my family] moved to this area and at the time the best school in the area was Welsh,"" she said. 
Having made the decision that her children would have a Welsh-medium education, Bethany's mother threw herself into learning the language. 
""She went to night school, while my sisters were really small. Five kids all under the age of 10, while learning this new language. So to me she's this massive inspiration,"" said Bethany. 
""I never knew anything different. I went to a Welsh cylch, like a creche, a Welsh primary school, a Welsh secondary school.""
She continued: ""After I left school, I went to an English college, and then I went to university. It's not that I lost my Welshness, it's just that it kind of went on the backburner. 
""That sense of pride in my Welshness, it kind of went, and I think that happens for so many of us Welsh speakers.
""When I started my TikTok, it was during the pandemic and I was stuck in university in lockdown with my husband, who is not a fluent Welsh speaker. 
""I was missing speaking Welsh with people, face to face. It just made me realise how much I took for granted."" 
Looking to reconnect with Welsh after beginning to feel ""rusty"" was also the main motivation for TikTok creator Nicky Gamble from Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf, who also has more than 40,000 followers on the platform. 
""I have grown up speaking Welsh, just through education. I went to a Welsh nursery, a Welsh primary school, a Welsh secondary school. So everything we were taught - history, maths, science - it was all done in Welsh,"" she said.
""My parents don't speak Welsh. It was something I mainly associated with school and friends.""
33-year-old continued: ""I've always been really proud of the fact that I can speak Welsh, and I've always been proud that, as a country, [we] have our own language.""
Nicky, who works full-time in recruitment, joined TikTok with her two stepdaughters, as a hobby during the pandemic. 
She's found that being able to share her Welsh language skills has spurred her on to keep it up. 
""I wanted to make it fun, I wanted Welsh to seem cool,"" she said. 
""I started making TikToks with some Welsh in there, and just kind of made it a bit cheeky as well, and I think that's what attracted a lot of attention. 
""After school, I didn't really speak a lot of Welsh, so I found TikTok really useful, it's brought it back to life for me."" 
While both Bethany and Nicky use a variety of social media platforms, they recognise TikTok as being particularly accessible for people looking to learn something new. 
Nicky said: ""Facebook is more for people you know, Instagram is quite posey, I think. Whereas TikTok is everything. And you have quite a large audience on there as well. 
""I think people judge TikTok and think it's just for youngsters, and it's not. It's really for everyone.""
She added that the algorithm on TikTok helps people to return to what they like watching.
However, she was shocked to attract such a large following.
""It's surprising to see how many non-Welsh speakers are interested in what I'm saying. That's good, they didn't just scroll past.""
Bethany grew up with social media from a young age, but says joining TikTok let her ""start a fresh"" as a content creator. 
""With TikTok, I didn't tell anyone about it. I really carved this name for myself as this Welsh girl, and I am proud of that and I will happily wear that with honour,"" she said. 
""I think the one thing with TikTok that's different from any other app is the videos are short and sweet. You're able to engage with people, I feel, on a better level.""
Bethany became a content creator after illness forced her to pause her planned masters degree studies.
She too has been surprised by the large and diverse interest in her Welsh content.
""Definitely in the beginning it was younger people,"" she said. ""I tend to utilise a lot of TikTok trends, and I incorporate Welshness into it. 
""But, at the same time, I've been surprised by how many older people I have engaged with. 
""They grew up speaking Welsh, but maybe unfortunately their family don't anymore. So it's nice for them to have someone to speak with and for them it represents their community, their childhood and all those things that make them who they are."" 
Bethany believes there are a lot of ""misconceptions"" about Welsh.
""I grew up in this bubble where Welsh wasn't even questioned. The status of the language, whether it is alive or dead. And then I went to university it was 'What do you mean you speak Welsh?', 'What is that?', 'I thought that was a dead language?'
""It really just shows there is a world outside my little town. Being on TikTok showed me more of people's misconceptions so I am now on my little mission to correct that.""
She continued: ""I think as Welsh speakers we have a responsibility to make the language as accessible as possible. 
""One thing that I never really thought of as a Welsh speaker was other people's perceptions of Welsh, and how difficult it is for them to learn it. 
""I can't do everything, but I can make a community that is non-judgmental and wants to help people. 
""It should be a happy thing, you should want to learn it and it should be a fun thing. It shouldn't come from a place of feeling bad or that you should.""
On the future of the language, Bethany added: ""It's an ancient language, it's one that has survived many campaigns against it. So I think it will survive this little blip as well. I have faith in the language, I have faith in my people, and I have faith in us to keep it going.""
Nicky said the decline in Welsh speakers was disappointing, but it motivated her to encourage others to learn the language. 
""TikTok, it's free, and you can hear someone speaking Welsh. 
""So I think it's easier to access, perhaps, and that pushes me to continue wanting to do Welsh content.
""I'd like to see the numbers rise again and people take an interest in the language. It's a part of who we are, our story. I just feel if we lost the language we would lose our identity.""
rested in learning Welsh, she said: ""Just give it a go, take it slow. You're not in a competition with anyone. Utilize all the different tools that are out there."" 
Bethany added: ""For any language the best way is to immerse yourself in it as much as you can. 
""Just start listening to some Welsh music, watch some Welsh TV or Welsh films. Engage with Welsh media. 
""It's meant to be fun, so don't put too much stress on yourself."" "	/news/uk-wales-64027345
technology	Nourah al-Qahtani: Saudi woman jailed for 45 years for social media posts	"A Saudi woman has been sentenced to 45 years in prison for her social media posts, in the second case of its kind this month, activists say.
A terrorism court convicted Nourah bint Saeed al-Qahtani of ""using the internet to tear the social fabric"" and ""violating public order by using social media"", rights group Dawn reported. 
Little is known about her other than that she criticised Saudi leaders.
Another woman was jailed for 34 years over her Twitter activity on 9 August.
Abdullah Alaoudh, director of research for the Gulf region at Dawn, told the BBC's Newshour programme that the US-based group had learnt of Qahtani's case only after being passed court documents by a judicial source, and that it was continuing to investigate. 
""Nothing in her court documents pertains to any violence or criminal activity,"" he said.
""The charges against her are really broad. They are using the counter-terrorism law and the anti-cybercrime law... that can criminalise any posting that is even remotely critical of the government,"" he added.
Several other female activists have reportedly been detained in relation to social media posts since last year. Mr Alaoudh said he feared that they could also be handed lengthy prison sentences.
""The Saudi government is sending a strong signal to the West that it does not care about human rights.""
Mr Alaoudh warned that it was ""impossible not to connect the dots"" between US President Joe Biden's controversial meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed in Jeddah last month and ""the uptick in the repressive attacks"". 
Mr Biden had previously vowed to make Saudi Arabia a ""pariah"" over its human rights record.
ALQST, a UK-based rights group, also expressed grave concern about Qahtani's sentence, which it said was ""based on [her] tweets"". 
""As feared, we are witnessing an alarming deterioration of the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia,"" it added.
Saudi Prisoners of Conscience account also tweeted that it had confirmation of the sentence, but there was no immediate comment from Saudi authorities.
Earlier in August, Salma al-Shehab, a Saudi PhD student at Leeds University, was jailed for 34 years. 
She was arrested while on holiday in Saudi Arabia in January 2021, and was found guilty of ""providing succour to those seeking to disrupt public order"" and ""publishing false and tendentious rumours"". 
Before leaving England, the 34-year-old mother of two had called for reforms and the release of prominent activists and intellectuals imprisoned under a crackdown on dissent overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
Shehab's prison term was believed to be the longest ever handed to a peaceful activist in the country until Qahtani's was reported."	/news/world-middle-east-62736118
technology	Can electrical stimulation improve your gym workout?	"first time that long-distance rower Lebby Eyres tried exercising in the gym while wearing a whole-body electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) suit, she says ""it felt strange"".
""I got into the suit, and then trainers sprayed me with water, and strapped these things around my arms, legs and glutes (buttocks),"" says the 51-year-old. ""I thought to myself, 'am I really going to be able to exercise wearing these?'
""Then the [electrical] stimulus of the machine gave me the most unusual sensations.""
When she woke up the following morning at home in London, Mrs Eyres says her muscles had the level of soreness that she typically got from working out for a few hours, yet she had only exercised for 20 minutes.
EMS has long been used by doctors to help improve the mobility of people with a number of health conditions, such as patients recovering from a stroke, or people with multiple sclerosis.
Using low currents of electricity to stimulate muscles and nerves, it is also often used by mothers during childbirth, in the form of a piece of equipment called a tens machine, to try to alleviate the pain. This sees the woman fix sticky pads to her lower back, and then use a hand-held controller to adjust the level of electrical charge that the pads emit. 
While those health usages typically focus on one area of the body, whole-body EMS suits (which typically comprise a short-sleeved top and shorts) are now a fast-growing trend in the fitness and gym world.
rical stimulation of your muscles speeds up the effect of exercising and strengthening. So you can do a 20-minute workout that is equivalent to one lasting 90 minutes if you weren't wearing the body suit.
While this might sound fanciful to many of us, the number of gyms offering EMS has been increasing quickly. One such provider, US chain Iron BodyFit, is continuing to expand in Europe after opening more than 100 studios in France over the past five years.
It launched its first UK venue in London last year, and plans a dozen more over the next 12 months. Other chains that focus on EMS, and are expanding in the UK, include Feel Electric and Surge.
Such growth is helping to drive the overall global market for EMS, which one report says will grow by 51% from $122m in 2020 to $184m in 2030.
But does EMS actually work in the fitness sphere? Does it really improve the efficiency of your workout and give you bigger muscles for less effort? And more importantly - is it always safe?
""We are bypassing the brain,"" says Phil Horton, UK director for German firm Miha Bodytec, one of the largest manufacturers of EMS body suits. ""We can trigger the muscle in a smarter and more efficient way compared to the way the brain would tell the muscle to move.""
He adds that the small electrical charge more easily reaches deep muscle tissue. Water is often sprayed on the suit to boost conductivity.
roblem for the EMS fitness sector is that studies into whether it works are very mixed, and even those that are positive use a lot of words like ""might"", ""could"", or ""may"".
One report back in 2011 said that the use of EMS ""has been acknowledged"" to help lead to ""significant improvements in strength"". Yet it then immediately added that such changes are ""still ambiguous"", ""poorly understood"" and ""require more study"".
An article earlier this year concluded that the jury was still very much out.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Meanwhile, the US Food & Drug Administration, which regulates EMS machines, says that when used for fitness they ""may be able to temporarily strengthen, tone or firm a muscle"", but only if accompanied by exercise and dieting.
It also cautions against the use of unregulated devices, as these may cause ""shocks, burns, bruising, skin irritation, and pain"".
Nicola Maffiuletti, a sports science expert at Swiss orthopaedic clinic Schulthess Klinik, has also long been critical of whole-body EMS.
""In particular, whole-body electrical stimulation is extremely difficult to dose properly,"" he says, adding that under-dosage means no effect, while over-dosage could cause muscle damage.
""So if we objectively look at the harmful versus beneficial effects of whole-body electrical stimulation, there are no strong arguments in favour of its use.""
Veteran US weightlifter Robert Herbst's opposition to whole-body EMS is more straightforward. The 64-year-old thinks it simply does not work.
""The stress put on your muscles by EMS is insufficient to create the micro-trauma weightlifting creates,"" says Mr Herbst, who has won several world and American championships, and still competes.
Yet US exercise physiologist Tom Holland says full-body EMS is useful because it can encourage people to do more exercise.  ""Squats, lunges, crunches, bicep curls and other traditional exercises are more fun when done through EMS,"" he says.
However, he says it is often not cheap, with prices in the US as high as $125 (£110), and those in the UK reaching as much as £130 per 20-minute session.
Back in London, Ms Eyres used whole-body EMS to help her train for rowing across the Atlantic in the 2021 Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge. She successfully completed the event, rowing in a boat with three friends.
She says that thanks in part to the use of EMS ""my abs are much better now than when I was 21"". 
""Everyone complimented me on my much stronger and toned figure."""	/news/business-62887379
technology	Floppy disks in Japan: Minister declares war on old-fashioned technology	"Japan's digital minister has ""declared war"" on floppy disks and other retro tech used by the country's bureaucrats.
Around 1,900 government procedures still require businesses to use the storage devices, plus CDs and mini-discs, Taro Kono said. 
He said regulations would be updated to allow people to use online services. 
Despite its reputation for innovative high-tech gadgetry, Japan is notorious for clinging to outmoded technology through its office culture.
Floppy disks - so-called because the original products were bendable - were created in the late 1960s, but were falling out of fashion three decades later thanks to more efficient storage solutions.
More than 20,000 typical disks would be needed to replicate an average memory stick storing 32GB of information.
But the legacy of the square-shaped device can still be witnessed to this day, as their visual appearance inspired the traditional ""save"" icon. 
A Japanese government committee has discovered about 1,900 areas in which businesses are required to use storage media like floppy disks when making applications or holding data. 
During a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Kono also criticised the country's lingering use of other outdated technology.
""I'm looking to get rid of the fax machine, and I still plan to do that,"" he said.
urning to storage devices, he asked: ""Where does one even buy a floppy disk these days?""
first time Japan has hit the headlines for its old-fashioned habits - which remain a paradox given the country's proficiency at developing exciting new products. 
Various explanations have been offered, including poor digital literacy and a bureaucratic culture with conservative attitudes.
re was shock when the country's cyber-security minister admitted in 2018 that he had never used a computer, saying he had always delegated IT tasks to his staff.
And it was not until 2019 that Japan's final pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.
Officials in the US were also discovered to still be using floppy disks to manage their nuclear weapons force during the 2010s - though this practice was reportedly scrapped by the end of the decade."	/news/world-asia-62749310
technology	Anti-vax groups use carrot emojis to hide Facebook posts	"Facebook groups are using the carrot emoji to hide anti-vax content from automated moderation tools.
BBC has seen several groups, one with hundreds of thousands of members, in which the emoji appears in place of the word ""vaccine"".
Facebook's algorithms tend to focus on words rather than images.
groups are being used to share unverified claims of people being either injured or killed by vaccines.
Once the BBC alerted Facebook's parent company, Meta, the groups were removed.
""We have removed this group for violating our harmful misinformation policies and will review any other similar content in line with this policy. We continue to work closely with public health experts and the UK government to further tackle Covid vaccine misinformation,"" the firm said in a statement.
However, the groups have since re-appeared in our searches.
One group we saw has been around for three years but rebranded itself to focus on vaccine stories, from being a group for sharing ""banter, bets and funny videos"" in August 2022. 
rules of the very large group state: ""Use code words for everything"". It adds: ""Do not use the c word, v word or b word ever"" (covid, vaccine, booster). It was created more than a year ago and has more than 250,000 members.
Marc Owen-Jones, a disinformation researcher, and associate professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, was invited to join it.
""It was people giving accounts of relatives who had died shortly after having the Covid-19 vaccine"", he said. ""But instead of using the words ""Covid-19"" or ""vaccine"", they were using emojis of carrots. 
""Initially I was a little confused. And then it clicked - that it was being used as a way of evading, or apparently evading, Facebook's fake news detection algorithms.""
In 2021 data from the Office for National Statistics suggested that there was a one in five million risk of dying from the Covid vaccine, compared with a risk of 35,000 deaths per five million of dying from Covid itself, if unvaccinated.
giants use algorithms to trawl their platforms for harmful content - but they are primarily trained on words and text, wrote Hannah Rose Kirk in a blog for the Oxford Internet Institute.
Ms Rose Kirk was part of a research team which created a tool called HatemojiCheck: a checklist for identifying areas where AI systems do not handle emoji-based abuse very well.
""Despite having an impressive grasp of how language works, AI language models have seen very little emoji,"" she said. ""They are trained on a corpora of books, articles and websites, even the entirety of English Wikipedia, but these texts rarely feature emoji.""
forms have already come under fire for failing to block or remove emojis of monkeys and bananas when posted as a racist gesture on the accounts of black footballers.
Rio Ferdinand: ""I have to explain the monkey emoji to my kids""
If the Online Safety Bill comes into law in the UK, the tech giants will face steep penalties for failing to identify and quickly removing harmful material on their platforms. But there are concerns that tools currently in use are not good enough to cope with the sheer volume of content that is posted, and the nuance and cultural differences that can cloud meaning.
Emojis can have multiple meanings, alongside whatever is officially declared by Unicode, the consortium which manages them.

Facebook said last year that it had removed more than 20 million pieces of content containing misinformation about Covid-19 or the vaccine since the start of the pandemic.
It also says it removes content which claims vaccines in general are more dangerous than the disease they protect against, or that they are toxic.

technology	Kim Kardashian pays $1.26m over crypto 'pump and dump'	"Kim Kardashian has agreed to pay a $1.26m (£1.12m) fine for advertising EthereumMax on her Instagram page.
US Securities and Exchange Commission said the reality TV star had received $250,000 for advertising the cryptocurrency, without disclosing she had been paid to do so.
She also agreed not to promote crypto asset securities for three years.
Her lawyer told BBC News: ""Ms Kardashian is pleased to have resolved this matter with the SEC.""
wyer said: ""Kardashian fully cooperated with the SEC from the very beginning and she remains willing to do whatever she can to assist the SEC in this matter. 
""She wanted to get this matter behind her to avoid a protracted dispute. 
""The agreement she reached with the SEC allows her to do that so that she can move forward with her many different business pursuits.""
Ms Kardashian, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, basketball player Paul Pierce and EthereumMax's creators were sued by investors in January.
gal action alleged they had collaborated to ""misleadingly promote and sell"" the cryptocurrency in a ""pump and dump"" scheme designed to inflate the price before selling to investors.
EthereumMax disputed the allegations at the time.
In spite of its name, EthereumMax has no legal or business connection with the Ethereum cryptocurrency.
Anyone can create a crypto coin.
All you need is a few pounds, a YouTube tutorial and a funky name.
month alone, dozens of new tokens will be launched, with creators promising their coin will be the next big thing.
With little intrinsic value to the product, marketing is key - and as in many modern industries, celebrities can be the make or break. 
EthereumMax put a huge amount of money into snapping up celebrities such as Kim Kardashian - and at first, it seemed to be working out. 
But as with many crypto coins, the fall was as dramatic as the rise. 
Even if EthereumMax had retained the value it gained after the celebrity pump, regulators both in the US and UK were extremely uncomfortable about the marketing of the coin.
rypto industry is still largely unregulated - but Kim Kardashian joins a growing list of people and companies being punished for promoting these highly risky products.
Gary Gensler, who chairs the SEC, called the case a ""reminder"" celebrity endorsement did not necessarily make a product worth investing in.
""Ms Kardashian's case also serves as a reminder to celebrities and others that the law requires them to disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities,"" he said.
Later, in a YouTube video about crypto investment, he added: ""Celebrity endorsements... don't mean that an investment product is right for you or even, frankly, that it's legitimate.
""Even if a celebrity endorsement is genuine, each investment has its own risk and opportunities.
""When it comes to crypto, remember many of these are highly speculative assets.

Google says the platform violates its policies on prohibiting content like physical threats and incitement to violence.
move makes it difficult for users with Android phones to download the app.
Devin Nunes, the CEO of Truth Social, has previously called Google a ""monopoly"".
ruth Social launched on Apple's App Store in February, though the roll-out was beset by problems.
However, the app isn't available on Google Play, where the vast majority of apps are downloaded on Android phones. 
Last week Truth Social's CEO said the decision on whether the app would be available was ""up to the Google Play Store"".
But Google says it's down to Truth Social to comply with its rules. 
A Google spokesperson told the BBC: ""On August 19 we notified Truth Social of several violations of standard policies. 
""Having effective systems for moderating user-generated content is a condition of our terms of service for any app to go live on Google Play,"" they added.
Google says it has offered Truth Social advice on how to fix the problems. Truth Social did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.
ruth Social is often described as a ""free speech"" platform. 
However, for the app to be downloadable on the vast majority of the world's phones it needs to be approved by Apple and Google. 
Far from Truth Social being a place of unfettered free speech, the platform in fact has many rules on what you can and cannot say. 
In fact, Truth Social has a long list, in its Terms of Service, of things that can and cannot be posted.

technology	The shops that connect people with their home countries	"At family-owned food shop Popat Mithai & Farsan, owner Vijaya Popat and her all-female team are often so busy dealing with customers in multiple languages that there's barely time to sit down, let alone chat with a nosy journalist.
Mrs Popat set up the business in Leicester back in 2011 to sell Indian sweets and savouries, and it has grown from two members of staff to 15 today. And an online operation was launched in 2018.
Serving the South Asian diaspora in the East Midlands city and further afield, sales soared during the coronavirus pandemic, as customers sought more comfort food - the tastes that they or their forebears brought to the UK from countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
Mrs Popat's son Shyam was put forward to speak to the BBC. ""My mum is widely known in the community as being the person that runs the business,"" he says.
""And they all want to speak to her specifically to see if she can source particular things.""
He adds that it's not just first generation immigrants, or those who have just moved to the UK recently, that make up the core customer base. Instead it is also the second generation, who might be buying food for their families, and increasingly online.
""During the lockdowns the website was a total lifesaver, and now we're out of lockdown it has become a thriving arm of the business in itself,"" says Shyam Popat. ""Online sales now account for approximately one-quarter to one-third of the entire turnover of the business.""
In addition to importing products from South Asia, the shop also buys from Kenya.
world's diasporas give to trade between countries is difficult to quantify, but governments are increasingly aware of the economic importance of migrant populations and their descendants.
Kenya announced in September that it would be creating a new ministry for Kenyans living abroad, and US President Joe Biden has announced that he will tell next month's US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington that he wishes to ""amplify diaspora ties"".
But just how big are the world's diasporas? There are currently 281 million people who live in a country other than the one in which they were born, according to the 2022 World Migration Report from the United Nation's International Organization for Migration (IOM).
umber equates to 3.6% of the global population, or one in 30 people. And it doesn't include any children those people have that are born in their new country, nor does it include the descendants of former migrants.
For this reason, the IOM defines the terms ""migrants"" and ""diasporas"" (which comes from the Greek to scatter) separately. The later also including descendants of former migrants ""whose identity and sense of belonging, either real or symbolic, have been shaped by their migration experience and background"". 
quates to billions of people, but an exact number is very difficult to quantify given that it is determined by a person's cultural identity. Even the IOM said back in 2020 that ""currently there are no attempts to measure global diaspora populations per se"".
More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade.
What is certain, is that the entrepreneurial drive within migrant populations has long been recognised. A 2010 report by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said that immigrant entrepreneurs were better educated than their native counterparts, and more likely to create a new business.
And often those firms are involved in the importation of food, clothing or other goods from a migrant's former country, such as Indian-born Vijaya Popat and her thriving shop in Leicester. The store, and others like it, played their part in India's exports to the UK totalling $10.4bn last year.
Based in Paris, Olivier Habiyambere is helping to boost Kenyan exports to Europe. He is the founder of website Kenyan Diaspora Market, which imports food and clothing in bulk from the African country, and then sells it to customer across the European continent.
Mr Habiyambere, who was raised in Kenya, came up with the idea for the business when he moved to Paris to study and met others from Kenya and East Africa.
""Everybody wanted Kenyan products, but the issue was bringing the products from Kenya to here,"" he says. ""People could pick up the products when they went to Kenya, but it's not like they could do that every year.""
So he launched the business in April 2022 to offer Kenyans in Europe an easier way of buying products from home. Mr Habiyambere adds that business has grown steadily, helped by Kenyan communities spreading the word via WhatsApp groups.
While Kenyan Diaspora Market is focused on Kenyan migrants, Glasgow-based website Agora Greek Delicacies now has more non-Greek customers than those from within the UK's Greek communities. 
It was set up a decade ago by husband and wife Christina Lyropoulou and Michael Sofianos, who had gone to university in the UK. They now employ 14 people and supply imported Greek food and drink to restaurants, cafes, individuals, and other businesses.
""We started expanding to the British audience - so those travelling to Greece or had Greek friends,"" says Ms Lyropoulou. ""And our online shop saw an increase in sales of about 1000% in the first months of the lockdown.""
Prof Pragya Agarwal, a behavioural and data scientist at the University of Loughborough, regularly buys products originating from her native India for herself and her family in the UK.
""For me personally, it's about maintaining the connection with the motherland, the fatherland - whatever you call it,"" she says.
She laughs as she describes her love of Indian mangos, and admits she regularly would regularly order from a particular store online in a bid to get her mango fix, especially during the pandemic.
""It's what I used to eat growing up in India every summer - every day after every meal.""
Maria Elo, is an associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark who has a number of books and articles on diaspora and trade.
She says it's important to be aware of the framing that occurs whenever diaspora is discussed, with migrants often described in one of two ways. 
One narrative is that migration and diaspora are problematic. Prof Elo describes that as a ""deficit view"" with negative connotations. But she adds there is also a positive narrative, which involves ""a big promise for business and economy"".
She adds that research shows that diaspora entrepreneurs are agile, and encourage cross-over products. ""We all eat pizza today, although we're not all Italians and that is something that crossed over a long time ago."""	/news/business-63542786

technology	Rolls-Royce tests a jet engine running on hydrogen	"Jet engine running on hydrogen
In a windswept corner of a military site on Salisbury Plain a small aircraft jet engine is undergoing tests that could one day lead to huge changes within the aviation industry.
gine itself is almost completely conventional. It is a Rolls-Royce AE-2100A gas turbine, a design used widely on regional aeroplanes around the world.
What is wholly unusual about it is the fuel being used. This is the first time a modern aircraft engine has ever been run on hydrogen.
Devoid of bodywork, with its intricate wiring and pipework exposed, it sits securely fastened to a sturdy test rig, while engineers cluster around an array of screens in the control room, a safe distance away. 
re being carried out by Rolls-Royce, after development work in Derby and in partnership with the airline easyJet. 
mmediate aim is a simple one - to show that it is possible to run and control a jet engine using hydrogen fuel, rather than conventional aviation fuels.
In the longer term, the plan is for hydrogen power to play a major role in allowing the aviation industry to continue growing, while cutting climate change emissions dramatically.
""The reason we're looking at hydrogen is really the drive for Net Zero,"" explains Alan Newby, director of aerospace technology at Rolls-Royce.
""Normally we would run this thing on kerosene. Kerosene is a hydrocarbon and therefore produces carbon dioxide when it burns.
""The beauty of looking at a fuel like hydrogen is that it doesn't contain any carbon and, therefore, when it burns it produces no CO2"".
roject is being supported by easyJet, which has contributed several million pounds towards the initial trials.
mpany believes that hydrogen power offers the best route to reducing emissions from short haul aviation.
""We started a few years ago looking at what might power the aircraft of the future,"" explains David Morgan, easyJet's chief operating officer.
""We looked at battery technology, and it was quite clear that the battery technology was probably not going to do it for the large commercial aircraft that we fly.
""We've come to the conclusion that hydrogen is a very exciting proposition for us.""
ge of hydrogen over batteries is that it provides much more power per kilogram. Batteries are simply too heavy to power larger planes. 
Yet hydrogen aviation remains a very long way off. The tests carried out so far have simply shown that a jet engine using hydrogen can be started up and run at low speed.
But to go from there to building a wholly new engine, capable of powering a passenger aircraft safely will take a great deal more research - and significant investment.
rcraft themselves will also need to be redesigned. Hydrogen, even in liquid form, takes up about four times as much space as the kerosene required to fly the same distance.
make it into a liquid in the first place, it needs to be cooled to -253C. Then, before being burned, it must be turned back into a gas.
""There's a big change from the aircraft point of view,"" says Alan Newby at Rolls-Royce.
""They're going to have to have a tank containing the hydrogen. You've got to keep it at this really, really cold temperature. 
""Then there's the issue of how you feed it through to the engine as well.""
r key question is where the hydrogen itself comes from, because that will have a dramatic impact on the environmental benefits it can provide
fuel used in the tests is so-called green hydrogen produced at the European Marine Energy Centre in the Orkney Islands.
It is made by using an electric current to split water into its components, hydrogen and oxygen. The electricity required is produced using tidal and wind power. This makes it a very clean fuel.
But most of the hydrogen produced for industrial use today is obtained from a process which involves mixing high temperature steam with natural gas under high pressure.
However, this produces a considerable amount of carbon dioxide, which is then released into the atmosphere. It also requires a considerable amount of energy - which is often provided by burning fossil fuels.
One alternative is what's known as blue hydrogen. This is produced in the same way, but the carbon dioxide is captured and either stored or reused. 
In theory, this should make it a cleaner, low-carbon fuel. But that view was challenged in a paper from researchers at Cornell and Stanford universities last year.
uggested that in fact, using blue hydrogen could still be more harmful to the planet than burning fossil fuels.
More technology of business:
""At the moment there's a lot of hydrogen hype,"" says Matt Finch, UK policy director of campaign group Transport and Environment.
""A lot of people are saying 'we can use hydrogen, we need hydrogen'. You hear it for cars, for trucks, for ships, for planes, for home heating, for chemicals.
""At the moment the UK effectively produces zero green hydrogen. To fulfil all the needs everyone wants is absolutely impossible.""
Mr Finch believes this means supplies of green hydrogen will probably have to be rationed for decades to come, and he says aviation may not be a priority for governments.
All of this means it is likely to be decades before zero-emission hydrogen planes become an everyday reality. 
Even then, they are likely to be confined to short haul markets, at least to begin with. On long haul routes, synthetic sustainable fuels are widely expected to offer a more practical solution. 
Nevertheless, these first tests on Salisbury Plain may one day be seen as the first, tentative steps towards a technological revolution in the industry."	/news/business-63758937
technology	Astronomer in Twitter limbo over 'intimate' meteor	"An astronomer from Oxfordshire was locked out of her Twitter account for three months after sharing a video of a meteor which was flagged by the site's automated moderation tools.
Mary McIntyre was told that her six-second animated clip featured ""intimate content"", shared without the consent of the participant.
Her only option was to delete the tweet.
However, in doing so she would have had to agree that she had broken the rules.
Her initial 12-hour ban went on for three months - and she exhausted the online appeals process.
""It's just crazy... I  don't really want it on my record that I've been sharing pornographic material when I haven't,"" she said of her refusal to delete the tweet.
Her account was still visible, but Ms McIntyre couldn't access it. 
Following the BBC publishing this article, it has now been restored.
Since Twitter was purchased by Elon Musk, thousands of staff have either been laid off or have left their jobs, but even before that Ms McIntyre found it impossible to talk to anyone about it inside the firm.
""If I wasn't getting a human response before [Musk took over], I think I've got zero probability of getting one now,"" she said at the time.
Yoel Roth, Twitter's then head of trust and integrity, had tweeted that the firm's layoffs did not affect ""most"" of the 2,000 content moderators working ""on front-line review"". Mr Roth has himself since left.
BBC tweeted Twitter's support account and contacted Mr Musk via SpaceX because Twitter currently has no communications department. There has been no response.
Ms McIntyre said other astronomers had shared the video on her behalf without consequences. 
She was worried that if she agreed to Twitter's rules of re-instatement, her non-existent misdemeanour might be flagged up, as she has regular checks in order to work with school-aged children, explaining astronomy.
""I miss the interaction,"" she said of her locked account. ""I feel a bit cut off from the astronomy world.""
US meteorologist Ryan Vaughan faced a similar ban after sharing a video of combine harvesters working in a field at night. This too was flagged as an intimate moment.
Mr Vaughan eventually did choose to delete the tweet and falsely accept that he had broken Twitter's community rules, because he wanted his account back.
""It's not fair and it's wrong,"" he tweeted. ""This needs to be fixed.""
re are also reports of Twitter accounts being wrongly flagged as belonging to children aged below 13 and blocked - including one belonging to a charity for the families of people held hostage, and another of a BBC journalist.
mmentator Kate Bevan said it was an example of the limitations of the current artificial intelligence tools used by Twitter and other social networks to carry out moderation tasks.
""AI tools are OK for quick and dirty decisions, but it shows that content moderation at scale is really difficult - both for humans and for the AI tools that are supporting them,"" she said. 
""It's even worse when there are no humans available to review bad AI decisions. Apart from the unfairness, it means the AI model isn't getting feedback, so it will never learn to improve.""
It is not a problem that is unique to Twitter: in 2021 the owner of a small digital photo gallery had pictures of wildlife, landscapes and buildings blocked by Facebook, on the grounds that they contained ""overtly sexual"" content.

technology	How do visually impaired people play video games?	"Ben Breen was born without sight but videogames have been part of his life for as long as he can remember. 
He started off playing games on his PC without any of the technology that may have helped him understand them. 
Since then he has seen more developers add features to games which improve the experience of visually impaired people. 
But now he wants to see all big gaming studios consider people with sight loss when developing games. 
""I started out with games like Fighter Pilot on PC not really understanding how anything worked because I didn't know about screen readers at the time, or any of the tech,"" he said. 
""So I was just pressing buttons, seeing what happens, and literally nosediving a plane.""
He began playing audio games with basic graphics designed for people with low or no vision.
Once developers started adding some features specifically for blind people, Ben was able to play more mainstream games for people of all abilities.
Studios have recently been creating games with more embedded features for those with sight loss, such as The Last Of Us Part 1 for PS5 which was released in September.
""I still do play audio-only games occasionally,"" Ben said. ""But I prefer stuff when it's enjoyable for more people.""
Helpful features include creating short-cuts on the handset, and lock-on aim in fighting games.
Screen narration tells the user what is happening visually on the screen, while navigation assistance tools allow the player to determine their distance from objects and enemies.
Now an accessible games and immersive technologies research officer with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), Ben is sharing his experiences with the billion-dollar gaming industry.
He was among those at a recent symposium in Dunde who spoke to representatives of Google, EA Games and Microsoft about how videogames could be improved. 
was hosted by Abertay University - the first in the world to launch a computer games degree - with the RNIB. 
By working with the university, Ben hopes future developers will create all of their games with accessibility in mind from the start.
He said: ""As much as we've had games released on a couple of platforms that are fully playable, we need to see all the companies stepping up.
""Even just at a basic level, increased accessibility equals increased sales.""
Ben added: ""Sight loss is a spectrum and gaming can still happen, but more needs to be done in terms of making games accessible.
""Whatever games I can play, I will play.""
He said studios need to accept that accessibility is important and he wants to see people with sight loss consulted during the development of games.
""I've had people say to me that they wouldn't want to game if they woke up without sight, but they would,"" he said. 
""You'd want to continue, and the way you're going to be able to continue is if games actually start adding the features in.""
Abertay's Dr Robin Sloan, who has been teaching and researching game design for 15 years, said designing the interactive aspects of games with inclusivity in mind and testing them on people with low or no vision was essential.
""That can be things like using high contrast, larger fonts and less complexity in the scene,"" he said.
""Beyond that, you get much more challenging things like making decisions around something that's happening that's really visual.""
He said standardising design models and codes with accessible features could help smaller games companies improve their inclusivity.
use smaller companies often buy in the foundational code for their designs.
""If the model is already accessible, this can allow the developers to just focus on the game,"" he added.
A spokesperson from the Association for UK Interactive Entertainment, the trade body for the UK games industry, said accessibility was a key priority. 
She added: ""The UK games industry has a strong track record of working with charities like SpecialEffect to adapt games and devices such as the Microsoft adaptive controller. 
""Meanwhile organisations like Many Cats work with studios on a recruitment and culture level to encourage thinking about accessibility at every stage of the development process.
""The games industry equality, diversity and inclusion initiative #RaiseTheGame has worked with the Royal National Institute of Blind People to help provide a perspective on the sector as well as to promote fundraiser and awareness events such as Gaming for RNIB. 
""RNIB has consulted with our education initiative Digital Schoolhouse, reviewing materials and providing training on making content accessible for visually impaired learners.""

The BBC investigated one such marketplace, spoke undercover to those apparently selling weapons, and gathered evidence that suggests the adverts for weapons are fake. 
""Ukrops [a derogatory Russian slang term used to refer to Ukrainians] are selling Javelins on the darknet. The command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine resells equipment and weapons supplied by Nato.""

On the same day, another pro-Kremlin Telegram channel, with 700,000 followers, posted in Russian: ""Thanks to Biden and European friends of Ukraine, Javelins, machine guns and even tanks will pop up all over the world in the hands of terrorists and criminals."" 
Pictures attached to the post showed an advert allegedly selling the FGM-148 Javelin, a US-made anti-tank missile system, for $30,000 (£26,000) and promising to deliver the weapons to the Ukraine-Poland border or abroad.

We decided to investigate these accusations ourselves using laptops that could not be linked back to the BBC. With a specialised web browser, we accessed the dark web where the level of anonymity attracts criminal activity. 
We found several sellers on the same marketplace mentioned by Russian state media outlets. They said they were selling Nato weapons, and their geolocation was Kyiv. However, the name of Ukraine's capital was misspelled in Ukrainian.

One of the main sellers often mentioned in Russian media reports is known as ""Weapons Ukraine"".

However, the BBC found that many of the photos of the weapons were not as they appeared. 
red warning sign indicates the image is old or has been manipulated
We found the image of the M4 carbine posted on a Russian website in 2014. The image of another rifle advertised by the seller had also been taken in 2014 and posted on a gun enthusiast's site. 
Another seller called ""Big Discounts On Weapons"", claiming to sell US-made Javelins and drones recently provided to Ukraine by its Nato allies, was more inventive. 
r photoshopped several old pictures - including ones of damaged drones - to make them look as if they were taken directly by him, and added the name of the marketplace. 
We spoke to StopFake, a Ukrainian fact-checking organisation. It found that the drones attached to the advert matched those of two Switchblade 300 drones with the same serial numbers shot down in Syria in 2015 and 2016.  
Russian state media repeatedly claim that the people behind these advertisements are Ukrainian. So we decided to get in touch with so-called ""sellers"" and check for ourselves. 
r selling Javelins and Switchblade 300 drones asked us to contact them on a messaging app where they were registered under the username ""javelinusa"". 
We spoke to them undercover, asking how we could buy weapons.  
""Put money into your account, then we'll invite an administrator to this chat. We'll announce our terms and conditions. We'll place goods into a stash. When you receive them, you'll text us that you're happy with everything, and then the administrator will transfer your money to me,"" javelinusa texted us in Ukrainian. 
However, in the course of our online conversation we noticed that their Ukrainian was full of grammatical errors. When asked about it, the ""seller"" replied that they were from Poland. 
We asked a linguist to analyse our chat with the trader.    
""The person behind these messages is Russian-speaking,"" said Daria Lewicka, expert in Polish language and a Ukrainian-Russian-Polish interpreter. 
She says there is substantial evidence that the messages written in Ukrainian were translated from Russian with the help of an online translator. 
""I see a lot of 'Russianisms' in his Ukrainian language, but I don't see any 'Polonisms' at all. For example, he uses a phrase ""зуби не заговорюй"" [which can be translated as ""don't beat around the bush""]. This is a common Russian phrase and it has no equivalent in Polish.""
r also made several typos, which meant the online translator could not understand them, and left the original words. They were both Russian words written with Russian letters.  
Later, we managed to contact another seller from ""Weapons Ukraine"".  
In the online chat, the trader also made grammatical mistakes in tenses and word endings, suggesting he was not a native Ukrainian speaker and that he was translating his messages.   
guist also found inconsistencies in many reviews mostly posted in Polish on the site, suggesting they were posted with the aid of a translation service. 
""Real people don't talk like this,"" Ms Lewicka said.
Despite the inconsistencies, Russian state media site RT depicts the sellers' ads and reviews as evidence that ""potentially suggests that the Ukrainian arms smugglers may have already established contacts with [Polish] border guards and are able to cross in and out of Poland without complications"". 
""Javelins can shoot down planes. And Stingers [US-made air-defence systems] can fall into the hands of terrorists and become a safety risk to European airports,"" claimed a separate report by Russia's Channel One.  
Serhiy Kharchenko is a fact-checker from StopFake specialising in tackling Russian propaganda. He says this is how the Kremlin uses fake news to reduce trust in Ukraine and disrupt arms supplies to Kyiv. 
""Their goal is to sow panic in Europe, saying that these weapons can be used against European citizens.""
He says these stories were produced by Russia primarily to influence an international audience. 
BBC found stories about the weapons sales published in English, Japanese, Vietnamese and several other languages across a range of sites including a mainstream Turkish news outlet and fringe American blogs and conspiracy sites.
Cybercrime Threat Intelligence Company KELA investigated the marketplace. It believes the listings were publicised by pro-Russian propaganda sources, or possibly created by them.
KELA says it is suspicious that the marketplace has relatively minimal activity - a low number of trades taking place - and that it is reasonably unknown, even among those who visit dark web marketplaces.  
""Usually, you would find people who know a marketplace. But we didn't find any reviews or recommendations of this platform. We had a lot of trouble finding anything about this marketplace, any kind of feedback,"" says Irina Nesterovsky, KELA chief research officer.
She questions how Russian journalists found it so easily. 
Ms Nesterovsky says it is not clear if the adverts were created specifically by pro-Russian actors or if scammers active on the dark web created them independently, and then pro-Kremlin sources picked them up. 
But the timing and the similarity of claims made by Russian state media outlets suggest that it could be an organised disinformation campaign. 
Mr Kharchenko agrees and is concerned that the same marketplace could be used by Russian propagandists to produce other false stories.  
""Now Russians have been creating stories accusing Ukraine of selling weapons. But who knows - later they might use the same marketplace to spread fakes about so called 'sales' of other 'goods' and 'services'. If they have created this marketplace, why not to use it? All they want is to sow the seeds of doubt and denigrate Ukrainians."""	/news/world-62983444
technology	Dutch town Bodegraven-Reeuwijk loses Twitter paedophilia rumour case	"A Dutch town has lost a court case seeking action by Twitter to stop the spread of a conspiracy theory saying it once hosted a satanic paedophile ring.
unfounded reports that Bodegraven-Reeuwijk was the site of the crimes in the 1980s first circulated in 2020. 
Local authorities had wanted all posts relating to the alleged events removed by the social media site.
But a Dutch judge said Twitter had done enough to remove unlawful content about the story.
One of three men behind the rumours said he had been the victim of abuse and witnessed murders as a child. 
ries have subsequently made the town, of around 35,000 people, the focus for conspiracy theorists who visit the local graveyard to lay flowers and write messages at the graves of dead children.
Local officials have said these visits cause ""great unrest and anger"" among residents, especially the parents of children buried at the cemetery.
In giving its judgement, The Hague district court said it would not order Twitter to remove other tweets relating to the stories from other accounts, but did tell the company to respond immediately to specific removal requests from the town.
witter had argued it was impossible to create a good filter to find Bodegraven stories that would not affect legal content.
ree men accused of instigating the Bodegraven story are currently in jail after being convicted in other court cases for incitement and making death threats to people including Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and former health minister Hugo de Jonge."	/news/world-europe-63138324
technology	Tesla's Optimus and the problem with humanoids	"Fans of Tesla and Elon Musk were enthralled by the unveiling of Optimus, a prototype humanoid robot, in California last week. 
I also enjoyed the theatrics - but I'm not alone in wondering why, apart from the wow factor, Optimus had to be human-like.
And while the fans hate any perceived criticism, Mr Musk himself has said Optimus is nowhere near market-ready.
rgument made for humanoids is they are best equipped to work with human tools, in human environments. People may feel more comfortable interacting with something that looks like a bit like them. And of course, they look great.
But how practical are they?
""A lot of companies work in the area of humanoids because it's interesting for the public to see,"" Owen Nicholson, chief executive of Slamcore, which specialises in sensor-driven vision, says.
""But wheel-based robots and even drones are so much easier to control. The amount of work that goes into just getting a humanoid to stand upright is huge.""
Some of the falls experienced by competitors in the Darpa Robotics Challenge
robotics behind Optimus look sound - Tesla is not exactly a novice at all this - but, Mr Nicholson says, by its release, the machine will have evolved into something physically more practical.
""I'd put money on them having more wheel-based robots,"" he adds.
In my job, I have seen lots of robots - all shapes and sizes - designed to clean, care for the elderly, teach, perform surgery, work as receptionists and tour guides, play Scrabble and chess, sing and dance, mix cocktails, pack shopping, deliver groceries, have sex, perform search and rescue and build cars. 
You name it, somebody is probably trying to build a robot for it.
Some of them work better than others - and demonstrations rarely go to plan. 
But what the sci-fi films fail to show is all the wires, the pre-programming and the very brief battery life. As I discovered when trying to film them, early football-playing robots could last for only 10 minutes.
I have had excruciating ""conversations"" with conversational robots, watched many devices fail to complete the tasks they were designed for, and seen the panic in the eyes of the executives in the room when a developer brandishing a bunch of wires says: ""We just need to reboot.""
But robots have advanced considerably faster than humans in the past decade. The robots of 2022 are far more skilled than those I first saw, in 2008, whereas I have acquired little more than a few grey hairs.
me and time again though, the most impressive performers tend not to look like people. Precision-surgery robots, warehouse robots, window-cleaning robots - none of them is remotely humanoid.
Expectation may be part of the problem.
Humanoids might be expected to function like people, performing a variety of different tasks - mowing the lawn, making a sandwich, cuddling a baby. 
But Prof Helen Hastie, of the National Robotarium, in Edinburgh, says robots are a very long way off being able to multi-task.
""What's most important is that the robot is fit for the task it is designed for,"" she says.
Boston Dynamics' doglike quadruped Spot is ideally suited to rough terrains, such as bombed-out buildings - but a robot designed to, say, work in a kitchen may need no legs at all.
Robots designed to work with vulnerable people, for example in care homes, might be better suited to looking a bit more human - but not too much.
It is a phenomenon known as the uncanny valley - if something looks human-like but not believably so, it becomes unnerving and even frightening. 
As Prof Helen Hastie says: ""If it's too human-like, it will put off the human."" "	/news/technology-63130363
technology	Brazil bans sales of iPhones without USB power adapters	"Brazil says it is banning the sale of iPhones which do not include a power adapter. 
In a statement on Tuesday, Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Public Security said it has fined Apple 12.275 million reais (£2.04m).
Brazilian consumer agency Senacon said Apple's decision not to include power adapters with new iPhones discriminates against consumers by selling an ""incomplete product"".
Apple will appeal against the ban.
mpany told Reuters in a statement it would work with Brazilian authorities to ""resolve their concerns,"" but added it has previously won several court rulings in Brazil on the issue.
""We are confident that our customers are aware of the various options for charging and connecting their devices,"" Apple said.
fine and ban on sales of iPhones without USB power adapters was announced a day before Apple showcased its new iPhone 14, 14 Pro and Apple Watch Ultra.
São Paulo's consumer protection agency fined Apple £2m last year, saying the sale of iPhone 12 and every model since then, violates consumer law because they don't come with chargers.
Apple stopped including power adapters and headphones in iPhone boxes with the launch of iPhone 12 in 2020.
It said the move, which came after first ditching power adapters from new Apple Watch boxes, would help reduce Apple's carbon footprint, by making packaging smaller.
""Sometimes it's not what we make, but what we don't make that counts,"" said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice-president of environment, policy and social initiatives, at Apple's 2020 September keynote.
She added there were already more than two billion official Apple power adapters out in the world. 
Senacon, which launched its case against the move last year, said Apple's arguments for removing USB power adapters from iPhone boxes on sustainability grounds were ""not enough"". 
It said there was no evidence that removing chargers had environmental benefits.
According to Brazil's Justice Ministry, Senacon said the company could have considered alternatives to reducing its environmental impact that would not place the burden on consumers - such as adopting USB-C cables and chargers to reduce e-waste.
European Union provisionally agreed on plans to enforce a common USB-C charging cable for portable electronic devices earlier this year.
Senacon also said the sale of new iPhones without power adapters was an example of Apple effectively forcing consumers to buy a second product after purchasing a new iPhone.
It said a power adapter should form part of the product because it is required to operate the phone and is an ""incomplete product"" without it.
rganisation added the move has transferred responsibility to third-party providers, as well as consumers, because iPhones without power adapters have not fallen in price.
Apple has been approached for comment."	/news/technology-62833037
technology	Ethereum change cut cryptocurrency power demand	"A change in the way the cryptocurrency Ethereum works may have cut its power consumption by country-sized amounts.
mount of electricity saved is similar to that used by Ireland or even Austria, work published in the data-science journal Patterns suggests.
Bitcoin, the largest crypto, is thought to use more electricity than Finland.
It has even been suggested emissions from Bitcoin could exceed the global savings currently made by driving electric vehicles, the article notes.
Like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum relies on a blockchain, a giant, constantly updating database, logging every transaction.
Previously, this was maintained and verified by a system called Proof of Work, used by many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.
Companies and volunteers whose computers helped to run the network were rewarded with new cryptocurrency coins. 
more work they completed, the greater the chance of creating new coins.
uraged businesses to set up massive warehouses of computers running 24-7, often on energy derived from fossil fuels, the article suggests. 
But on 15 September, in an event known as The Merge, Ethereum switched to a system called Proof of Stake, where the chance of creating a new coin no longer depends on the amount of computing work completed.
mplexity of the switch was compared to rebuilding a skyscraper's foundations while it remained standing.
But it cut Ethereum's electrical energy consumption by at least 99.84%, the peer-reviewed ""perspective"" article suggests.
How cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin work
Ethereum blockchain also supports hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of other coins and crypto products such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
But the paper's author, Alex De Vries, a data-science and economics researcher at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, warns the computers may simply have switched to creating other cryptocurrencies.
In September 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy said legal limits on energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining should be considered.
Mr De Vries said: ""The Bitcoin community has been very anti-change - but the Ethereum community has shown that despite concerns and resistance, it is possible to make the necessary changes on a live blockchain, which means that the Bitcoin community may need a little bit of a nudge from the outside to actually make things happen.""
Gavin Brown an associate professor at the University of Liverpool, told BBC News: ""Sustainability is an essential problem to resolve in the crypto space. To achieve this, the prospect of new regulation is an important lever.""
But it was in the interests of for Bitcoin and Ethereum enthusiasts to clean up their own act to attract money from institutional investors such as banks or pension funds.
""Much of that money may presently want to invest in crypto but is unable to do so until or unless crypto becomes more sustainable,"" he said.
And Mr De Vries warned it would be premature for the Ethereum community to declare a ""complete victory"" over the environmental concerns facing crypto assets ""as the blockchain-based system remains relatively inefficient compared to more centralised alternatives""."	/news/technology-63872983
technology	Elon Musk says $8 monthly fee for Twitter blue tick	"Elon Musk has said Twitter will charge $8 (£7) monthly to Twitter users who want a blue tick by their name indicating a verified account.
As part of changes after a $44bn (£38bn) takeover of the social media site, Mr Musk said it was ""essential to defeat spam/scam"".
A blue tick symbol next to a username - normally for high-profile figures - is currently free.
move could make it harder to identify reliable sources, say critics.
Mr Musk, the world's richest person, added that paid users would have priority in replies and searches, and half as many advertisements.
""Power to the people! Blue for $8/month,"" the billionaire said on Twitter, criticising the old method of blue tick verification as a ""lords and peasants system"".
But Nu Wexler, former Twitter Head of Global Policy Communications, warned that introducing a fee for blue ticks could make it harder to spot disinformation.
""With disinformation as an issue that a lot of platforms are struggling with, verification is one of the ways that journalists, academic researchers and some users use to filter out disinformation or low quality information,"" Mr Wexler told the BBC's Today programme.
""If you're offering up blue checks for rent, it makes it harder to sift through disinformation and find high quality information.""
witter's former method of verifying users for a blue tick included a short online application form, and was reserved for those whose identities were targets for impersonation, such as celebrities, politicians and journalists.
mpany introduced the system in 2009, after it faced a lawsuit accusing it of not doing enough to prevent imposter accounts. According to reports in the Guardian newspaper, there were about 400,000 verified users on Twitter as of 2021.
But Mr Musk is still facing a hefty challenge as he works to overhaul Twitter's business, which has not posted a profit in years.
He has said he wants to reduce Twitter's reliance on advertising, even as some companies have grown concerned about advertising on the site under his leadership.
General Motors - a rival of Mr Musk's electric car company Tesla - said last week it was suspending advertising on the site.
Meanwhile, some other major brands have more quietly put a temporary halt to advertising on the platform as they wait to see how Mr Musk's changes play out, a media buyer for a leading advertising firm told the BBC.
On Monday, one of the world's biggest advertising companies, IPG, advised its clients to suspend Twitter adverts for a week, citing a need for more clarity on the Twitter's plans to ensure ""trust and safety"" on the platform. IPG is given billions of pounds per year, by some of the world's biggest brands, to handle their marketing budgets.
rge for blue tick privileges drew scepticism after original reports that said the charge could be $20 (£18) monthly. 
Many on the platform echoed the statement of author Stephen King, who wrote in response to reports of changes that instead Twitter ""should pay me"".
Mr Musk wrote to Mr King saying, ""We need to pay the bills somehow!"""	/news/business-63478854

government said the £108m project would benefit properties ""from Grasmere to Gilsland and Buttermere to Beckermet"" by 2026.
More than 99% of the county would be connected to gigabit technology once work was completed, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), Michelle Donelan, told the BBC.
It is part of a £5bn national rollout.
Ms Donelan said: ""Cumbria is going to be the most-connected region in the UK. Sixty-thousand [properties] is the government investment, commercial companies have been doing the easier bits.
""It's a rolling project. They'll be doing it as quickly as they can to get homes and business connected to gigabit, which is more reliable and can cope with multiple devices and support businesses.""
ract for the project in the county has been awarded to Belfast-based supplier Fibrus.
Installation work had started and the first gigabit connections were expected by the spring, the DCMS said.
Additionally, it has been announced a mountain rescue base at Wasdale Head in the Lake District will be one of three remote area's taking part in a government trial featuring Elon Musk's Starlink, which uses satellites to beam a broadband signal down to Earth.
Rievaulx Abbey, in North Yorkshire Moors National Park, and two sites within Snowdonia National Park will also feature in the scheme.
DCMS said recent tests showed that in many locations Starlink satellites could deliver internet speeds of up to 200 megabits per second - four times faster than the current UK average broadband speed of just over 50Mbps.

technology	Elon Musk to quit as Twitter CEO when replacement found	"Elon Musk has said he will resign as Twitter's chief executive officer when he finds someone ""foolish enough to take the job"".
re had promised to abide by the result of a Twitter poll which saw 57.5% of users vote ""yes"" to him quitting the role.
He says he will still run the software and servers teams after his replacement is found. 
Changes on the platform since his takeover have been much criticised.
Since Mr Musk bought the social media site in October, he has fired about half of its staff and attempted a rollout of Twitter's paid-for verification feature before putting it on pause. The feature was relaunched last week.  
Civil liberties groups have also criticised his approach to content moderation, accusing him of taking steps that will increase hate speech and misinformation.
On Friday, Mr Musk was condemned by the United Nations and European Union over Twitter's decision to suspend some journalists who cover the social media firm.
UN tweeted that media freedom was ""not a toy"", while the EU threatened Twitter with sanctions.
first time the multibillionaire has responded to the poll launched on Sunday asking if he should resign. More than 17.5 million users voted, with 42.5% voting no to Mr Musk stepping down.
Finding someone to take over the social media platform may be a challenge, according to Mr Musk. After laying off Twitter staff last month, the billionaire reportedly told remaining workers that the company he just bought could see ""net negative cash flow of several billion dollars"" in 2023 and ""bankruptcy is not out of the question"".
""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive,"" he tweeted following this week's poll.
Some people speculate Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey could also come back to run the company. He resigned as chief executive in November 2021. 
Other names mentioned as possible replacements include Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's former chief operating officer, Sriram Krishnan, engineer and close confidante to Mr Musk, and Jared Kushner, US former presidential adviser and son-in-law of Donald Trump. 
In the past Mr Musk has obeyed Twitter polls. He is fond of quoting the Latin phrase vox populi, vox dei which roughly means ""the voice of the people is the voice of God"".
But on Tuesday, he confirmed Twitter would only allow paid subscribers with a blue tick to vote on changes to policy in future. 
It came after one user claimed that so-called bots appeared to have voted heavily in the poll about Mr Musk's role at the firm. Mr Musk said he found the claim ""interesting"".
Elon Musk's tenure as Twitter chief executive may turn out to be short, but it certainly wasn't sweet.
At times it felt like we were watching a train come off its tracks. 
He seemed to enjoy the circus he created. Did he get bored, did his investors pull him back, or did he finally listen to those telling him that Tesla, the electric car firm to which much of his wealth is linked, needs urgent attention from its CEO - also him - as its value continues to nosedive?
Given how open Mr Musk appears to be on Twitter, perhaps one day he will tell us.
But this is not the end of the Musk/Twitter show. He will still own the firm (nobody is likely to buy it off him any time soon, especially not at the price he paid), and he will undoubtedly still be a prolific and influential tweeter in his own right. 
Plus, he's got to find someone willing to take his place (and work with him) - and that position might prove a difficult one to fill. 
witter's paid-for verification feature was rolled out for a second time last week after its launch was paused. The service costs $8 per month, or $11 for people using the Twitter app on Apple devices, and gives subscribers a ""blue tick"". 
Previously a blue tick was used as a badge of authenticity and was free.
For weeks, investors have called on Mr Musk to step down from running the social media platform, saying he has been distracted from properly running Tesla.
Shares in the the electric car company have plummeted more than 65% over the past year. 
Mr Musk sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla shares to help fund his purchase, which helped to push the shares down.
""Finally a good step in the right direction to end this painful nightmare situation for Tesla investors,"" said Dan Ives from investment firm Wedbush Securities after Mr Musk's tweet on Tuesday."	/news/business-64037261
technology	What parents need to know to keep their kids safe online	"""Parents think a child is safe because when they're online they're quiet, but they don't know what they're watching,"" says Nic Wetton, the head teacher of JH Godwin Primary School in Chester.
She warns their silence is often misleading. ""Children can be traumatised by horrific videos they see online,"" says the head teacher who has 180 pupils aged from four-and-a-half to eleven in her care.
Ms Wetton says she sees children as young as six playing 12-rated computer games online. ""We've had cases of children needing medication to sleep. This is immensely worrying"".
Some children coming in to school are inattentive in class because they've been up all night, playing on devices like tablets or phones. One recent craze was to see who in a WhatsApp group could stay up the longest - the winner sent a message at 04:00.
As well as watching inappropriate content online, or staying up too late, children who are online unsupervised can be vulnerable to paedophiles. 
ues are familiar to Rachel O'Connell. She has investigated online child abuse, working on statistical techniques to identify  abusers.
In the course of her research she went online posing as an eight-year-old child who hadn't made friends at school. Her understanding of the mindset of predators is extensive and chilling, for example, she says that friendless children are often a target: ""They look for that,"" she explains.
Ms O'Connell visits schools and finds many parents have no idea which apps their children can access. ""Putting naked selfies online seems to be a rite of passage now,"" she says. ""Parents feel they don't know how to 'digitally' parent, they can feel helpless. We need oversight."" 
One significant problem is that children can be targeted while browsing sites that are theoretically off limits for young people.
So, preventing children from getting access to any of these sites would help tackle the problem.
usiness founded by Ms O'Connell, TrustElevate, is based on the principle of Zero Data - establishing whether a child should be allowed to log onto a service but without giving away any personal details about that child. 
Ms O'Connell has been trialling Zero Data techniques with mobile phone operator, EE. She wants to create a family access app that will screen users for their age and seek parental approval. 
rustElevate software generates a token containing just the child's age range and no personal information, this information allows a service provider to check out a potential new user. 
While the service provider can block access, if the details don't tally with the permissions held on the system, the token cannot be exploited to push other services, or products, to the child. 
f technical tools are a help, but schools are fighting back as well.
At JH Godwin School, Ms Wetton runs online safety workshops, where parents are invited to bring a laptop along so they can download safety apps and parental controls.
r frustration, engagement from parents is not a given. She has arranged workshops where just one parent turned up out of 150 who have children at the school. 
More technology of business:
Ms Wetton has even tried a tactical approach, putting online safety talks ahead of popular events, such as the Christmas, or Easter bingo sessions. However, she has had heckles from people who felt they shouldn't be lectured on their evening out. 
So, the school is left to come up with practical measures to shield its children from malicious online contact.
For example, she suggests not wearing a school branded jumper while on TikTok. ""If children do that, then anyone watching knows where they are going to be at 0800 and 1600.""
She believes online safety apps should be frontloaded on to any device a child might use. 
""Surely, that's better than waiting for a mental health pandemic in the very young? Plus, computer games can be addictive. If we don't protect them, we get exhausted children coming here, and it's like trying to teach an empty vessel that just won't fill."" 
She wants to see tech companies made to feel responsible for safeguarding, through measures like age verification software. 
And TrustElevate's Ms O'Connell, says the government should be doing a lot more to regulate children's access to games and websites.
""There's no oversight into that at the moment, no oversight into the impact of it.""
A UK government Online Harms White Paper published in 2019, reported that 12-15 year olds spend over 20 hours a week online. And regulator, Ofcom, states that 79% of that group had experienced at least one potentially harmful experience online in the previous year. 
Online Safety Bill, currently before Parliament, will introduce a duty to protect children from harmful, or inappropriate material. 
Bill does not stipulate which technology tools should be used to do this, but Ofcom may respond to failures to protect children by recommending the use of age verification systems.
Speaking to BBC News, Chris Philp, Minister for Tech and the Digital Economy, lays out what he believes will be a much stricter operating environment for online platforms in the future. 
""If platforms want children to use their services, they will need to protect them from accessing content that is harmful or inappropriate. If their services are meant for adults, they will need to prevent underage access.""
He insists that schools and parents wrestling with online dangers will be assisted by rigorous government measures. ""Those who fail to comply, will face massive fines and risk their services being blocked from access in the UK."" 
At JH Godwin School tougher protection measures would be warmly welcomed. Ms Wetton describes the gulf between how big tech presents its role in society as positive and the unintended consequences in the real world.
""Live streaming services are supposed to bring 'like-minded people' together, but in reality it means predators using search terms such as 'girls dancing'.""
She knows the techniques paedophiles use, such as matching their ""pace"" to their intended victims. ""These people are patient and work on a child, so we must open their eyes [to potential dangers]."" "	/news/business-61577187
technology	The abortion privacy dangers in period trackers and apps	"After the Supreme Court's Roe v Wade ruling overturned citizens' constitutional right to abortion in the US, there has been concern about data protection, particularly in the 13 states which have already moved to make ending a pregnancy illegal.
But what sort of data might incriminate someone, how could the authorities get hold of it, and what are the tech firms doing?
Gina Neff, professor of technology and society at University of Oxford, tweeted the day after the ruling: ""Right now, and I mean this instant, delete every digital trace of any menstrual tracking.""
Her message has so far received more than 200,000 likes and been retweeted 54,000 times.
Period trackers, such as Flo, Clue, Stardust and Apple Health, are used to help women predict when their next period is likely to be, and are often used to either try to prevent pregnancy or to try to conceive.
re are fears that the apps could be used to punish those seeking a termination, if law enforcement got hold of the data.
Like a number of other high-profile apps, Natural Cycles, which is billed as a digital form of contraception, insisted last month that all the data it stored was ""safe and will be protected"".
However, on Monday it told the BBC it is working on ""creating a completely anonymous experience for users"".
""The goal is to make it so that no-one - not even Natural Cycles - can identify the user,"" it said.
unds like it is considering encryption. Speaking of which, how about messaging services - that confidential exchange between two close friends that feels so private at the time?
use of end-to-end encryption messaging services such as WhatsApp and Signal (Telegram is not by default encrypted, although it can be) to discuss sensitive issues is generally preferred by security experts and privacy campaigners.
firms which run them cannot see the content of the messages themselves, and do not receive or store them - only the sender's and recipient's devices are able to decode them.
However, this is only useful if those devices are themselves not taken away or unlocked by anybody else.
Generally in the US, the police need a warrant to search an electronic device such as a phone or laptop, just as they would to search a house. Broadly speaking, the protection here comes under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. 
However, there are some exceptions. Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation says US police have a right to search without a warrant if they ""have probable cause to believe there is incriminating evidence in the house, or on an electronic device that is under immediate threat of destruction"". 
Under the Fifth Amendment, which is the individual's right not to incriminate themselves, a person can refuse to unlock a device even if it is taken, but the reality is blurry, according to various lawyers.
""Courts have reached conflicting conclusions as to whether and when the compelled decryption of a password - or biometric identifier-protected device runs afoul of the Fifth Amendment,"" wrote the Congressional Research Service in a report in 2020.
And if the device itself is not seized - a subpoena from the authorities to the tech firms, asking for an individual's data, is a powerful tool. 
Giants like Google and Apple not only run back-up and cloud services for their customers using their own storage, but also collect their own separate user data, including internet activity and location.
Google says that even after something has been deleted by a user and is therefore not visible to them - such as a browser history - some of it may still be retained ""to comply with legal or regulatory requirements"".
If these firms receive an official demand, they can challenge it, but the pressure is on them to comply.
In 2021, the New York Times reported that in the first six months of 2020, Apple challenged only 4% of requests for customer account data. and generally complied with 80-85%.
According to Google's transparency report, it supplied ""some data"" in 82% of cases requesting information in the first six months of 2021. Of almost 51,000 cases, 20,701 were subpoenas and 25,077 search warrants.
Is this the time for tech firms to reconsider their data practices?
Last month, a number of senior members of the US Congress, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, signed an open letter to Google asking it to collect and store less data about its users, including location information, out of concern that it could be used to bring about abortion prosecutions.
""No law requires Google to collect and keep records of its customers' every movement,"" they wrote.
So far, the tech firms have not commented on whether they plan to make any changes to the way in which they collect and manage customer data in light of the ruling. 
BBC has asked for this information.
What many large US firms - including Facebook owner, Meta, as well as Disney and Amazon - have said is that they will fund expenses for employees who have to travel to another state for medical care which is not available where they are, including abortion.
re is some concern that people who live in a state where abortion is banned but travel out of state to have one, may face prosecution when they return. It is unclear whether this could be the case, but it is not routinely applied to other laws which vary from state to state, such as gambling.
Dr Stephanie Hare, author of the book Technology is not Neutral, says that while the companies' commitment is ""a welcomed first step"", it's not enough.
""That's only going to help a very small amount of people, assuming some of them want to share this information with their employer in the first place,"" she said. 
""What we need to know is what these firms are going to do to limit data collection on all users, and how they can prevent user data from being used against them in their healthcare choices.""
EFF has published a privacy guide which includes this advice:
As for researching abortion online, Prof Alan Woodward, from University of Surrey, believes it's unlikely that law enforcement will speculatively begin to seek this sort of personal data. 
""They're not likely to be going after people who are thinking about having an abortion,"" he said.
""But if they are gathering evidence after the event, if they have arrested someone - that evidence could then include browser history, emails and messages."""	/news/technology-61952794
technology	Google loses appeal over record EU anti-trust Android fine	"An EU court has largely upheld a record fine against Google for using the Android platform to cement its search engine's dominance.
€4.125bn (£3.5bn) penalty is the largest anti-trust fine ever handed down by the European Commission.
It said Google had breached its laws by forcing Android phone-makers to carry its search and web browser apps in order to access the Google Play Store in 2018.
Google has since changed its terms.
firm said it was ""disappointed"" by the verdict.
""Android has created more choice for everyone, not less, and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world,"" Google said in a statement.
Google acquired the mobile phone operating system developer, which today powers roughly 70% of the world's mobile phones, in 2005 for $50m (£43m).
European General Court reduced the European Commission's original fine slightly in Wednesday's final ruling on Google's appeal. It said this was to reflect ""the gravity and the duration"" of the infringement.
""The General Court largely confirms the Commission's decision that Google imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices and mobile network in order to consolidate the dominant position of its search engine,"" it said.
A European Commission spokesperson said it will ""carefully study the judgement and decide on possible next steps"".
European Consumer Organisation, which represents a network of consumer groups across the EU, welcomed the ruling.
Monique Goyens, its director general, said the ruling ""confirms that Europe's consumers must enjoy meaningful choice between search engines and browsers on their phones and tablets"". 
She said Google had deprived consumers of ""genuine choice"" over which search engines to use. 
""If they preferred, for example, to use more innovative and privacy-friendly services, Google's restrictions prevented them from doing so.""
urt's ruling shores up the European Commission's efforts to clamp down on Big Tech, after anti-trust fines against Intel and Qualcomm were quashed by the European General Court earlier this year.
Google says it was acting like any other business when it told other manufacturers using Android that in order to include the Play Store on their smartphones and tablets, they also had to pre-install Google's own search and web apps.
Without that store, the devices would have had limited access to other apps, making them a lot less desirable to buy. The EU says this was unlawful.
ragged on for four years now, but Google did change its terms after the original ruling, in 2018. The European court lowered the fine slightly to reflect this - but it's still the largest anti-trust penalty it has ever given out.
Google says Android offers more choice, not less, and that anyone is free to change their search and web browser apps - but the reality is that most people never stray from the option that came with their phone.
A number of different manufacturers use Android as the operating system for their devices.
Google's version of Android does not prevent device owners downloading alternative web browsers or using other search engines.
But at the time of the original 2018 judgement the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said that only 1% of users downloaded a rival search app, and 10% a different browser.
Google rejected the accusation.
""Rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition and Android has enabled all of them,"" chief executive Sundar Pichai blogged.
In that original ruling, the EU commission said that Google had abused its ""dominant position"" by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on manufacturers because:
Google was required to ""stop and to not re-engage in any of the three types of practices"" or do anything else that might have the same effect.
In denying Google's appeal, the court agreed with all but the last of these findings - concerning payments to manufacturers - which it annulled.
European Commission first began scrutinising Android in April 2015, after a complaint by FairSearch - a lobby group that originally included Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle among its members.
Clifford Chance, a law firm representing FairSearch, said the latest judgment was a ""vindication"" of its client's complaint.  
A partner of the firm, Dieter Paemen, said in a statement: ""The annulment of one of the infringements found and the reduction of the fine won't lighten up the mood in Mountain View - that's just a drop in the bucket for Google.
""This is a positive outcome for consumers who stand a better chance of real choices on their mobile devices.""
Now, Mr Paemen said, the Commission must turn to seriously enforcing the ""remedies"" in the decision. "	/news/technology-62888137
technology	Ukraine war: Iranian drone experts 'on the ground' in Crimea - US	"Iran has deployed military experts in Russian-occupied Crimea to help launch drone attacks on Ukraine, the White House says.
Iranians are trainers and tech support workers, a US spokesman said.
Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was struck by ""kamikaze"" drones on Monday, deployed by Russia but believed to be Iranian-made.
UK has announced sanctions on Iranian businesses and individuals responsible for supplying the drones.
""We assess that Iranian military personnel were on the ground in Crimea and assisted Russia in these operations,"" White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
A ""relatively small"" number of Iranians are providing technical support and Russians are piloting the drones in Ukraine, he said. 
""Tehran is now directly engaged on the ground, and through the provision of weapons that are impacting civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine,"" Mr Kirby said.
US will ""pursue all means"" to ""expose, deter and confront Iran's provision of these munitions against the Ukrainian people"", he added.
Ukraine identified the drones - or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - used on Monday as Iranian Shahed-136 weapons. 
re known as ""kamikaze"" drones because they are destroyed in the attack - named after the Japanese fighter pilots who flew suicide missions in World War Two.
Russia has used the drones and missiles to hit critical infrastructure around Ukraine in recent days, destroying almost a third of the country's power stations since Monday last week. 
As a result, restrictions on electricity use were introduced in Ukraine for the first time on Thursday. 
UK has announced sanctions on three Iranian generals and an arms firm over Russia's use of Iranian drones to attack Ukraine.
UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly accused those listed of ""warmongering"" and profiting off Moscow's ""abhorrent"" attacks.
Among those targeted is the chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, Major General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, as well as Shahed Aviation Industries, a drone manufacturer.
Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Moscow of placing explosives on a key dam in southern Ukraine.
If the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant is critically damaged, 80 towns and cities could be flooded and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant could be left without water for cooling, Mr Zelensky said. 
It could also deprive the whole of southern Ukraine, including Crimea, of its water supply. 
On Wednesday, the respected Institute for the Study of War think tank reported that Moscow may be planning an attack on the dam which it would blame on Ukraine, believing that the resulting flooding may give Russian forces cover as they retreat from parts of the Kherson region. The dam is 70km (45 miles) north-east of the city of Kherson.
Russia is evacuating civilians from the parts of Kherson region under its control, in expectation of a Ukrainian offensive to take the city. "	/news/world-europe-63329266
technology	North Korea drones: South's military apologises for pursuit failure	"South Korea's military has apologised for failing to shoot down five drones that North Korea flew across their mutual border on Monday.
Seoul fired warning shots and sent jets and attack helicopters to shoot down the aircraft, one of which flew close to the capital.
Despite a five-hour pursuit, the drones reportedly all returned to North Korea. 
South Korea's President has said that the incident showed the military's readiness was ""greatly lacking"".
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, which represents the major branches of its armed services, acknowledged in a statement on Tuesday that while the military can counter ""attack drones that pose a real threat"", it is limited in its ability to detect and strike smaller spy drones.
""Our military's lack of preparedness has caused a lot of concern to the people,"" said a senior official, Kang Shin-chul. He added that the military would ""actively employ detection devices to spot the enemy's drone from an early stage and aggressively deploy strike assets"".
BBC's Seoul correspondent, Jean Mackenzie, has said it is concerning because the drone that flew near Seoul had the potential to run surveillance operations and to photograph sensitive areas.
Speaking at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Yoon Suk-yeol said he would seek to speed up the creation of a military unit to monitor North Korea's military facilities in response to Monday's incident, which would be supplied with cutting-edge stealthy drones.
He also blamed his predecessor, Moon Jae-in, for his ""dangerous"" North Korea policy that included a 2018 inter-Korean military pact banning hostile activities in the border areas.
Monday's incursion was the first time in five years that North Korean drones had entered the South's airspace and comes amid increased tensions on the peninsula, with the North conducting a record number of missile tests this year.
Local media were reporting that there had been another possible drone sighting in South Korea on Tuesday, but the defence ministry has said that this was a flock of birds.
Earlier this month, the North claimed to have performed major tests needed to help it develop its first spy satellite, which could be used to monitor South Korea. It released an aerial photo of Seoul, which it said had been taken during the test.
Experts believe North Korea is working to refine and improve its weapons, while putting pressure on the United States to ease sanctions in any future negotiations."	/news/world-asia-64100974
technology	Online Safety Bill: Olly Stephens' parents hopeful for social media law	"rents of a murdered teenager say they are feeling ""positive"" there will be new laws to make it harder to share harmful content on social media
Stuart and Amanda Stephens attended a debate on the Online Safety Bill in the House of Commons.
mpaigned for tighter restrictions on tech firms after it transpired a fatal attack on their son Olly was planned on social media.
government has said it wants the bill to pass during this session.
rteen-year-old Olly Stephens was stabbed to death near his home in Reading by teenagers who plotted his killing across numerous social media platforms.
Stuart and Amanda Stephens have previously spoken about their increasing exasperation with the government for repeated delays to the bill.
roposed legislation is intended to end self-regulation for social media firms and force them to remove harmful content. 
watched the report stage of the bill in the House of Commons from the public gallery, along with other parents including Ian Russell, father of Molly who took her own life in 2017 after watching images of self-harm and suicide on Instagram and Pinterest.
gether, the parents have formed the Bereaved Families for Online Safety initiative, supported by the NSPCC to campaign for a safer internet for children.
A joint statement said the Online Safety Bill was a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to save families like ours from the horrific, unending pain of losing a child"".
Mr Stephens said afterwards that he had ""faith"" the bill would be passed.
He said: ""Children are curious, they can find anything, anywhere [on social media] - it's the responsibility of the companies to control that feed.
""Hopefully this will set the standard globally, other countries will adopt the same policies and we all stand together. We're feeling a lot more positive.""
Having seen the debate from the public gallery, Mrs Stephens said there had been ""a lot of empathy"" for parents in their position.
""They mentioned our names and our children's names and that means the world - that feeling of care and who has been affected by this,"" he said.
""I got the feeling the power will be taken away from the social media companies. They wont be able to continue as they are - not caring, not doing anything. Ofcom will have teeth.
""It's given me more of a feeling of hope that it is going to happen now"".
Speaking during the debate in the Commons, shadow culture minister Alex Davies-Jones said the bill was ""unnecessarily overly-complicated"" and paid tribute to the families who lost children to online harm.
""I sincerely hope this evening's debate will do justice to their incredible hard work and commitment in the most exceptionally difficult of circumstances,"" she added.
Culture secretary Michelle Donelan said the Online Safety Bill was a ""ground-breaking piece of legislation"".
""The sooner we pass this bill, the sooner we can start protecting children online. It will need to evolve as technology changes.""
She said a planned two-day committee stage ""will not delay or derail the bill"" from receiving royal assent during the current parliamentary session.

technology	WhatsApp: We won't lower security for any government	"f WhatsApp says it will not ""lower the security"" of its messenger service.
If asked by the government to weaken encryption, it would be ""very foolish"" to accept, Will Cathcart told the BBC.
Government plans to detect child sex-abuse images include the possible scanning of private messages.
NSPCC has criticised WhatsApp's position, saying that direct messaging is ""the front line"" of child sexual abuse. 
government says tech firms need to tackle child-abuse material online. Its proposals are part of the Online Safety Bill, which has been delayed until the autumn. 
""They shouldn't ignore the clear risk that end-to-end encryption could blind them to this content and hamper efforts to catch the perpetrators,"" said a government spokesperson.
""We continue to work with the tech sector to support the development of innovative technologies that protect public safety without compromising on privacy.""
End-to-end encryption (E2EE) provides the most robust level of security, because - by design - only the intended recipient holds the key to decrypt the message, which is essential for private communication.
gy underpins the online exchanges on apps including WhatsApp and Signal and - optionally - on Facebook messenger and Telegram.
Only the sender and receiver can read those messages - not law enforcement or the technology giants. 
undrum currently facing the technology community is the UK government's pledge to support the development of tools which could detect illegal pictures within or around an E2EE environment, while respecting user privacy. 
Experts have questioned whether it is possible to achieve - and most conclude client-side scanning is the only tangible option. But this destroys the fundamentals of E2EE, as messages would no longer be private.
""Client-side scanning cannot work in practice,"" Mr Cathcart said.
Because millions of people use WhatsApp to communicate across the world, it needs to maintain the same standards of privacy across every country, he added.
""If we had to lower security for the world, to accommodate the requirement in one country, that...would be very foolish for us to accept, making our product less desirable to 98% of our users because of the requirements from 2%,"" Mr Cathcart told BBC News.
EU Commission has said technology companies should ""detect, report, block and remove"" child sex abuse images from their platforms. 
""What's being proposed is that we - either directly or indirectly through software - read everyone's messages,"" Mr Cathcart said. ""I don't think people want that.""
UK and EU plans echo Apple's effort, last year, to scan photographs on people's iPhones for abusive content before it was uploaded to iCloud. But Apple rolled back the plans after privacy groups claimed the technology giant had created a security backdoor in its software.
Ella Jakubowska, policy adviser at campaign group European Digital Rights, said: ""Client-side scanning is almost like putting spyware on every person's phone. 
""It also creates a backdoor for malicious actors to have a way in to be able to see your messages.""
Dr Monica Horten, policy manager for the campaign organisation Open Rights Group, agreed: ""If Apple can't get it right, how can the government?
""Client-side scanning is a form of mass surveillance - it is a deep interference with privacy.""
Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey, told BBC News that scanning could be misused: ""Of course, if you say: 'Do you think children should be kept safe?' everyone's going to say 'yes'.
""But if you then say to someone: 'Right, I'm going to put something on your phone that's going to scan every single one of your images and compare it against the database,' then suddenly you start to realise the implications.""
Mr Cathcart said WhatsApp already detected hundreds of thousands of child sex-abuse images.
""There are techniques that are very effective and that have not been adopted by the industry and do not require us sacrificing everyone's security,"" he said. ""We report more than almost any other internet service in the world.""
But that claim has angered children's charities. 
""The reality is that as it stands right now, under this cloak of encryption, they are identifying only a fraction of the levels of abuse that the sister products, Facebook and Instagram, are able to detect,"" NSPCC head of child safety online policy, Andy Burrows said.
He called direct messaging ""the front line"" of child sexual abuse. 
""Two-thirds of child abuse that is currently identified and taken down is seen and removed in private messaging,"" Mr Burrows told BBC News.
""It's increasingly clear that it doesn't have to be children's safety and adult privacy that are pitted against each other. We want a discussion about what a balanced settlement can look like.""

technology	Molly Russell: Dad wants no further delay to online harm bill	"Watch: Molly Russell's father says social media corporate culture ""must change""
father of 14-year-old Molly Russell says ""there is no time for delay"" in legislating to stop children seeing harmful content online.
An inquest found social media material contributed ""more than minimally"" to Molly's suicide in 2017.
Despite being reassured the Online Safety Bill would not be watered down, Ian Russell said he remained concerned that it could be delayed further.
He also said online platforms must stop self-regulating their content.
Molly Russell took her life five years ago after an act of self-harm while suffering depression.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The current government has said that they want the UK to be the safest place in the world to be online and yet we're still here and we're not regulating the platforms. 
""I think it's really important, firstly, that something that is illegal in the offline world must be illegal and we must be better protected when it's found on the online world.
""And I think the hardest thing that the online safety bill is tackling is perhaps this content that's described as 'legal but harmful'.""
Mr Russell revealed the new culture secretary, Michelle Donelan, called him last week ""to reassure me that the government took this [Online Safety Bill] very seriously and it wasn't going be... watered down"".
Online Safety Bill aims to lay down rules in law about how platforms should deal with harmful content.
Andrew Walker, the senior coroner for north London, said Molly, from Harrow, north London, appeared as a healthy girl who was flourishing at school, having settled well into secondary school life and displaying an enthusiastic interest in the performing arts.
However, Molly had become depressed, something common in children of this age, the coroner said. The inquest was told her condition worsened into a depressive illness. 
""She died from an act of self-harm while suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content,"" the coroner said.
""She had access to images, video clips and text concerned with self-harm and suicide, or that were otherwise negative or depressing in nature.""
roner ruled she saw images that ""shouldn't have been available for a child to see"". 
Mr Russell also paid tribute to his daughter. 
He said: ""She was one of the most endearing, gorgeous, extraordinary people. She was so insightful, I couldn't wait to see what she was going to do.""
He revealed that although he was pleased with the coroner's conclusions, the inquest itself had affected his family.
""When the verdict came in, I think we were quite numb and we're still processing it,"" he said.
""It was exhausting for us as a family. It was two weeks in court, but five years since Molly died.
""When it's the death of your youngest child who has ended their own life, it's just an extraordinary overwhelming grief which is the strongest anyone can ever feel.
""So the inquest itself couldn't compete with those early days of of huge grief and just struggling to get by second by second sometimes. 
""But it really did reconnect us with those moments and remind us how much we miss Molly and how much we wish she hadn't seen that content and that she was still with us.""
He also urged families to create an environment where issues can be openly discussed.
He added: ""I think the most important thing as a family is to find a way to cross the generations so that the parents can keep a channel of communication going with their children. 
""That transition that happens from being a child to being an adult, those teenage years, are some of the hardest years we all live through. 
""It's really important to try and not push anything that's a wedge between the generations and try and keep talking about mental health, talking about suicide if you need to. 
""It's more safe to talk about suicide. If you have worries about a child, I've learned since Molly's death, don't keep them to yourself, be direct and talk directly to your child about it.
""My prime reason for doing this is to prevent other fathers, families and sisters going through this.""

technology	Google 'airbrushes' out emissions from flying, BBC reveals	"way Google calculates the climate impact of your flights has changed, the BBC has discovered.
Flights now appear to have much less impact on the environment than before.
's because the world's biggest search engine has taken a key driver of global warming out of its online carbon flight calculator.
""Google has airbrushed a huge chunk of the aviation industry's climate impacts from its pages"" says Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist of Greenpeace.
With Google hosting nine out of every 10 online searches, this could have wide repercussions for people's travel decisions. 
mpany said it made the change following consultations with its ""industry partners"".
It affects the carbon calculator embedded in the company's ""Google Flights"" search tool.
If you have ever tried to find a flight on Google, you will have come across Google Flights.
It appears towards the top of search results and allows you to scour the web for flights and fares.
It also offers to calculate the emissions generated by your journey.
Google says this feature is designed ""to help you make more sustainable travel choices"".
Yet in July, Google decided to exclude all the global warming impacts of flying except CO2.
Some experts say Google's calculations now represent just over half of the real impact on the climate of flights. 
""It now significantly understates the global impact of aviation on the climate"", says Professor David Lee of Manchester Metropolitan University, the author of the most comprehensive scientific assessment of the contribution of air travel to global warming.
Flying affects the climate in lots of ways in addition to the CO2 produced by burning aviation fuel.
ude the creation of long thin clouds high up in the atmosphere - known as contrails - which trap heat radiated by the Earth, leading to a net warming effect on our planet.
warming impacts mean that although aviation is only responsible for around 2% of global CO2 emissions, the sector is actually responsible for around 3.5% of the warming caused by human activity.  
And it is a sector that is only going to get bigger. 
Since 2000 emissions have risen by 50%, and the industry is expected to grow by more than 4% every year for the next two decades, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Google is open about its calculations for the tool - posting the methodology on a US software website called GitHub.
BBC was alerted to the fact that it had posted a note saying it was changing how it assesses the impact of aviation.
It is a curious document.
Google begins saying it has made the change following ""recent discussions with academic and industry partners"".
It acknowledges these factors are ""critical to include in the model"" and cites the emphasis given to them in the latest report by the UN's climate science body, the IPCC.
Google reiterated this point when approached by the BBC, saying it ""strongly believes"" that non-CO2 effects of aviation should be included in its calculations. 
Yet on Github Google says: ""the details of how and when to include these factors requires more input from our stakeholders"".
reason for this, Google said in reply to a request for comment, was that the company's priority was the ""accuracy of the individual flight estimates"" it provides to its consumers. 
It says it is working with academics to better understand how contrails and other warming impacts affect specific flights.
UK government takes a different approach. 
It recommends companies reflect the additional impacts of flying by multiplying the CO2 emissions a flight generates by a factor of 1.9 - effectively doubling their impact. 
In its guidance to companies, the UK's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy warns the value of this multiplier is ""subject to significant uncertainty"", but says ""there is currently no better way of taking these effects into account"".
ransport and Environment, a group campaigning to reduce the environmental impact of travel, agrees.
""Current scientific knowledge is sufficient to state that non-CO2 effects represent two thirds of the total climate impact of aviation"", it says. 
""The industry has hidden this problem for decades... Google should show customers the non-CO2 effects for each flight, as the European Parliament has proposed to do.""
Google's changes are likely to have far-reaching effects.
mpany's carbon calculation methodology is widely recognised as the industry standard in aviation.
It is used by Skyscanner, one of the biggest online travel agencies in the world with more than 100 million visitors a month.
A number of other major online travel businesses including Booking.com, Expedia, Tripadvisor and Visa have said they intend to use it too.
Google's chief sustainability officer, Kate Brandt, has said the company aims to ""build tools that enable travellers and business around the world to prioritise sustainability"".
Industry experts say the decision to change its methodology will have the opposite effect.
""I worry the impact of the equivalent of hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 will be ignored because it has become invisible to customers,"" says Kit Brennan, a founder of Thrust Carbon, a UK company specialising in helping businesses reduce the effect their travel has on the climate.
He fears consumers could come to believe that non-CO2 impacts on the climate are not relevant in the longer-term, despite the science that contradicts this view.
would mean up to 1.5% of the warming caused by human activity would be being ignored and the pressure on airlines to reduce their emissions would be cut accordingly.
Update 26 September 2022: The graphic ""How Google's calculations have changed"" was updated after Google provided the BBC with more information as to how it calculated emissions from flights before the change to its tool."	/news/science-environment-62664981
technology	Apple sued over Apple Pay payment system	"Apple has been hit with a lawsuit in the US over Apple Pay. 
giant is being accused of using its market power in the mobile phone industry to fend off competition from other payment card issuers. 
-action complaint was filed in a federal court in California by Affinity Credit Union, an Iowa-based chartered credit union.
Apple did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. 
According to the complaint, Apple ""coerces"" consumers who use its smartphones, smart watches and tablets into using its own wallet for contactless payments, unlike makers of Android-based devices that let consumers choose wallets, such as Google Pay and Samsung Pay.
mplaint alleges that Apple prevents consumers from using competing mobile wallets capable of offering competing tap and pay solutions.
Iowa's Affinity Credit Union said Apple's anti-competitive conduct forced the more than 4,000 banks and credit unions that use Apple Pay to pay at least $1 billion in excess fees annually for the privilege.
It also said Apple's conduct minimised the incentive for the California-based company to make Apple Pay work better and make it more resistant to security breaches.
""Apple's conduct harms not only issuers, but also consumers and competition as a whole,"" Affinity Credit Union said.
""If Apple faced competition, it could not sustain these substantial fees.""
wsuit seeks unspecified damages, and a halt to Apple's alleged anti-competitive conduct.
Apple already faces a possible heavy fine after European Union regulators on 2 May said it had abused its dominance in iOS devices and mobile wallets, by refusing to give payment rivals access to its technology.
According to the complaint, Apple charges issuers a 0.15% fee on credit transactions and a flat 0.5 cent fee on debit transactions using Apple Pay, while Android-based rivals charge nothing.
ff is represented by the law firms Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Sperling and Slater.
Last August, they helped obtain a $100 million settlement for smaller iOS developers which claimed Apple overcharged them on commissions.
In discussing the European Union's probe of Apple's mobile payment policies in May, the bloc's digital chief Margrethe Vestager said Apple claimed it couldn't provide access to NFC for security reasons.
In Europe, most payments in shops made with a mobile phone rely on a wireless technology called 'Near Field Communication' - NFC.  
functionality enables communication between a customer's mobile phone and the shop's payments terminal - allowing 'tap and go'. 
""Our investigation to date did not reveal any evidence that would point to such a higher security risk,"" Vestager said on the EU's website.
""On the contrary, evidence on our file indicates that Apple's conduct cannot be justified by security concerns.""
Allegations that Google overcharged millions of app users in the UK are also set to go to trial.
uit is being brought by a consumer affairs campaigner, Liz Coll, on behalf of almost 20 million British users of Google's Play Store.
Her aim is to compensate UK Android smartphone and tablet users for years of alleged overcharging by Google and infringement of competition law. 
She said: ""We are confident our claim is a good one. 
""Google Play Store's imposition of a headline 30% charge on our digital purchases is unlawful and unjustifiable, and we look forward to arguing the case for UK consumers at trial.""

Rosie Breen, of Basingstoke, was promoting a fizzy alcoholic drink saying it was ""only 63 calories a can"" but could ""actually get you drunk"". 
was investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and later removed. 
A TikTok spokesperson said alcohol promotion was ""globally prohibited"" on its platform. 
Ms Breen has since apologised to her 428,000 TikTok followers for the post, which she said was a ""reflection of her opinion"".
She also confirmed she would comply with TikTok rules in the future. 
In the video, Ms Breen could be seen dancing with a can of drink in each hand and pointing to captions.
uded: ""I'm on my weight loss journey & they're only 63 calories a can"" and ""they actually get you drunk"".
After a viewer complained, the ASA banned the video for making health claims about an alcoholic product, encouraging excessive drinking and featuring someone under 25 years old.
A spokesperson for the authority said: ""We told Whisp Drinks and Rosie Breen not to make non-permitted low calorie nutrition claims about alcoholic drinks and to ensure future marketing communications for alcoholic drinks did not encourage excessive drinking or show people who were, or appeared to be, under 25 years of age in a significant role.""

technology	Vanuatu: Hackers strand Pacific island government for over a week	"Vanuatu's government has been knocked offline for more than 11 days after a suspected cyber-attack on servers in the country.
k has disabled the websites of the Pacific island's parliament, police and prime minister's office.
It has also taken down the email system, intranet and online databases of schools, hospitals and other emergency services as well as all government services and departments. 
utdown has left the nation's population - about 315,000 people living across several islands - scrambling to carry out basic tasks like paying tax, invoicing bills and getting licences and travel visas.
Essentially anyone with a gov.vu email or domain has been affected, locals told the BBC.
""Anyone who tried to do anything with the government knew the system was down,"" said Ginny Stein, an Australian journalist and communications consultant who spent years living in Port Vila, and left on Monday.
""My experience of trying to check out of the country... well they just couldn't operate. They were really struggling to get basic things done.""
She described major delays to any applications to government as officials have resorted to manual systems and in many cases even shut up shop.
""You'd walk into the offices and they were closed or they were turning you away saying 'come back next week maybe, but we don't know',"" she said.
Still, government staff have done their best to keep things going - with some using their own personal emails and internet hotspots for essential work.
Instead of electronic transfers, people have been paid with cheques. One civil servant relayed the experience of walking from department to department to get the relevant checks and sign-offs on an application. Others have been taking notes manually.
According to civil servants who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, it appears the government's servers were taken out on Friday 4 November. 
Emails bouncing back from government addresses were the first sign something was wrong, residents said.
""If you take out the government internet… it affects everything. You want to do shipping? You've got to get stuff through approvals through customs. It affect airlines. It affects the health system - there isn't one bit of it that's unaffected,"" said Ms Stein.
No one from the government or the Prime Minister's office has yet returned the BBC's calls.
But AFP news agency and the Vanuatu Daily Post carried a government statement saying its online system had been ""compromised"" for two days. 
re appears to be a financial motivation. Australian newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald reported the attackers had demanded a ransom, which the Vanuatu government refused to pay. 
No detail has been disclosed about the value of that extortion bid, or who the hackers are.
It's also unclear how the attack occurred and what protections Vanuatu had in place. Experts have noted the whole system was likely centralised and hosted on the government's own servers, a fundamental security flaw.
ready pledged to upgrade its system. In the meantime it's asked neighbouring Australia - traditionally its largest aid partner - to help rebuild its network. 
As of Wednesday, the government domain was still down. A spokesman told the Herald the government's website ""should be back next week"".
Why might Vanuatu have been targeted?
k has come less than a month after a new government was elected - a potential time of vulnerability. ""But the new government has responded quickly and not agreed to the ransom request,"" said Dr Meg Keen, director of the Pacific Islands Programme at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute.
""We don't yet know who is behind this attack, but a government spokesman has suggested it was an outside attack, likely from the Asia region."" 
Some have speculated that the hack may have originated in Indonesia. Vanuatu has long supported the independence movement in the Indonesian province of West Papua, where much of the population is Melanesian. The Indonesian military is accused of gross human rights abuses in the province.
Others note Vanuatu's position in the Pacific region - as a key nation that has relations with the US, China, Australia and New Zealand.
r has seen Pacific Island nations courted by both Washington and Beijing. Island leaders were invited to the White House in September, while China's foreign minister carried out a whistle-stop tour around the Pacific in June seeking a regional deal.
In recent years, Vanuatu has become one of the Pacific islands closest to Beijing. Chinese investment has built its parliament house, sporting stadium and convention centre. Beijing has an embassy in Port Vila, while Washington's representation is a three-hour flight away in Papua New Guinea.
However, Australia - allied with the US - has for over four decades been Vanuatu's largest aid donor and closest security partner.
Internet provision is a critical utility. Last year, the Australian government funded its telecoms giant Telstra's purchase of Digicel Pacific, a Pacific telecoms company, in a move widely seen as a political block to China's influence in the region. 
re had been talk that Digicel might sell its Pacific arm to Chinese state-owned operator China Mobile. Australia also secured an internet cable for the neighbouring Solomon Islands in 2018.
Dr Keen said Vanuatu, like other countries, aimed to secure its government information from external attacks. She noted a ""global vulnerability"" to such attacks - including in Australia, where hacks on a health insurer and telecommunications firm in recent weeks have exposed data of nearly half the population.
But Vanuatu has far fewer resources. Its economy is largely reliant on farming and tourism. The low-lying nation has been ranked among the most vulnerable to climate change.
""The attack is an added strain on public systems,"" Dr Keen said.
Ms Stein, who had worked in government departments in Vanuatu, noted the country's internet system had appeared fragile - with variable internet coverage and limited server capacity.
""It's a really miserable thing to do to a small island nation that just doesn't have the resources to deal with this,"" she said."	/news/world-asia-63632129

He said he had particularly missed getting to church services and found YouTube a chance for alternative ""fellowship"".
Mr Cull said the social media platform had allowed him to form bonds with people across the world.

technology	Why the folding phone revolution has a way to go	"me last year I had just become the proud new owner of a folding phone - the Samsung Galaxy Flip3.
For the uninitiated, this is a handset about the size of an average smartphone, which folds in half. 
I told everybody who would listen that it was the phone I'd been waiting for since the Motorola Razr clam shell of 2004 - finally I'd have a device that would fit in my pocket again.
rteen months later, the dream is over. A couple of days ago the ""fold"" line suddenly got dramatically larger and turned silver, the lower half of the screen went green, the top half became unresponsive, and then an ominous black cloud began to spread around the screen. 
It is now what you might call an ex-phone.
I'm not the only one - there are dozens of people online sharing similar tales of woe. One recent contributor on Reddit wrote that their brand new device broke within five hours. 
Folding phones were unveiled to great fanfare in 2019. There was much industry speculation that this would be the device that would revitalise a stagnating smartphone industry, create a new buzz around handsets once again and persuade people to upgrade, as figures suggested they were holding on to their phones for longer, unenthused by homogenous black rectangles. 
Huawei and Samsung led the foldable charge and remain the market leaders. Other rivals are mainly in the Chinese market - budget brands such as Oppo, Xiaomi and Vivo. Apple remains notably absent from the scene.
I remember sitting in a structure the size of an aircraft hangar in Barcelona that year, with audible gasps as Huawei showed off its version, the Mate X - with a launch price of about £2,000.
I persuaded an incredibly nervous member of the Chinese tech giant's team to let me hold one, just for a few seconds, for a photo.
""Do NOT move the fold,"" he begged.
me year both firms delayed the launch of their new gadgets, Samsung at the last moment, when early reviewers reported broken screens.
But durability tests since then have showed improvement. Earlier this month Samsung unveiled the next generation of its foldables - the Fold4 - and promised tougher screens and improved water resistance. 
According to Samsung, the current generation should survive 200,000 folds. I can't prove it, and I am a heavy phone user, but I'm not convinced I opened mine that often in the 13 months I had it.
As for the ""folding revolution"" - well Samsung says it sold almost 10 million folding handsets in 2021 and there is certainly a fanbase for the devices online. However that same year, Apple sold more than 49 million iPhones in just three months, according to consumer data company Statista. So folding handsets are still a very small chunk of the multi-billion dollar smartphone industry.
""I haven't seen loads of broken foldables,"" Ben Wood of analysts CCS Insight tells me, ""but at a time when [our research shows] people are keeping their phones in the UK for four years or more, people are looking to have phones that last longer.""
g-time industry watcher is confident Samsung's new phones will have more longevity and, he says, manufacturers have to do something different if they are to compete with the ""freight train"" of a product that is Apple's iPhone.
""I really admire Samsung for saying we have to be bold, we have to do something different.
""Do we all need a foldable phone? Absolutely not. It's definitely for people who want something that looks different. The Flip in particular has a strong female bias.""
, which folds horizontally into a more compact, square device is certainly more sympathetic to being carried inside smaller pockets - or indeed lack of pockets altogether - that are often an unwanted feature of women's clothes.
I had no issues with my folding phone while it worked, and it was often a conversation starter because it was so unusual. I only ever met one other fellow Flip3 owner, a man on a train who asked me where I got the case for mine, because he kept dropping his (the shiny exterior is very slippery - mine also suffered some knocks).
""I've only ever seen those on the telly!"" said one lady who stopped me in a cafe to have a look. I asked her whether she wanted one, and she just laughed.
You can of course repair them - at a cost. The price of an inside screen repair is £309, according to the Samsung website - that's £90 more than the cost of a new screen on its standard device the S21. A new Flip3 handset is currently advertised at £899 if bought outright. Samsung also offers an insurance package which brings down repair costs.
But given the environmental impact of making smartphones - there are about 60 elements in a handset - not to mention soaring costs of living, longevity is more crucial than ever. Android and Apple software have been tweaked to keep older devices running for longer - Apple controversially even slowed down older iPhones in order (it said) to prolong the battery life.
In the current climate, a folding phone may feel like a risky approach to a device that millions rely on every day. I've gone back to a budget Android while I figure out my next move -  but I'm not sure I've fully closed the door on foldables."	/news/technology-62727710
technology	Suffolk dad demands PowerPoints ahead of pocket money rise	"A father who makes his sons give a PowerPoint presentation when they want more pocket money says it helps them to grow in confidence.
Phil Quickenden, who lives near Woodbridge, Suffolk, came up with the idea after learning his son Joshua, 15, was not participating in class.
He believed two years of lockdown had had an impact on his eldest child's speaking skills.
He said being able to articulate and influence others was essential.
Mr Quickenden's youngest son, Sam, 10, also started giving a presentation to his parents, to explain why he should have a new video game or money for items outside of his monthly allowance/pocket money.
""It was a great way for them to test their skills, build up their confidence and fill some of that gap from lockdown when they missed some of those [socialisation] opportunities,"" said Mr Quickenden. 
As a result, he said his eldest son Joshua had grown in confidence, both in the classroom and with friends.
Sam had ""always been confident in terms of his peers, but has developed that"", said Mr Quickenden. 
""He's much more articulate and happy to engage, so it's had a positive impact,"" he added. 
rvant, who makes ""a lot"" of presentations for work, said schools should do more to develop skills in public speaking. 
A lot of his younger staff, who were technically capable of using Powerpoint, lacked the skill to be engaging, according to Mr Quickenden. 
""They can technically put together some slides, but it's something different to stand up in front of people and get your point across clearly and articulately,"" he said.
""But crucially it's about confidence - being able to stand up in front of a groups and say your piece. I think it's really important.""
Mr Quickenden said the needs of the workplace had changed significantly over the last 15 years, and particularly during Covid.
""I think as technology builds and takes over, those human interactions become more and more important,"" he said.
""Being able to... engage with somebody is something a computer will never be able to do.""

technology	Israel’s balancing act over Ukraine grows trickier after drone strikes	"Israel has repeated its long-standing refusal to sell air defence weapons to Ukraine despite a fresh appeal from Kyiv after this week's ""kamikaze"" drone strikes.
weapons unleashed by Russia were reportedly Shahed-136 drones supplied by Iran - causing Kyiv to make a fresh demand for help saying Tehran's ""complicity"" should be a ""red line"" for Israel. 
Israel and Iran are avowed enemies, but the Israelis have so far refrained from providing Ukraine with weapons in a bid to maintain relations with Moscow.
On Wednesday, Israel's Defence Minister Benny Gantz said their position had not changed. 
""Our policy toward Ukraine is clear - we are on the side of the West, we provided humanitarian aid, took care of refugees and the wounded,"" he told Israel's Kan radio.  
""For obvious reasons, we did not want to involve ourselves in combat systems. This was the policy until now. I am careful about this matter.""
Speaking later to EU diplomats, Mr Gantz said: ""We will not provide weapon systems.""
At least eight people were killed in Monday's explosive drone attacks in Ukraine.
US believes the drones - or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - were transferred from Iran to Russia in violation of a United Nations resolution linked to the Iran nuclear deal, which bars transfers of certain military technologies. Iran denies supplying the drones to Moscow.
After the attacks Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the country would request air defence systems from Israel ""without delay"". 
""Now that Iran has effectively become an accomplice in the crime of aggression against Ukraine, I think that if there is anyone in Israel who is still unsure about whether or not to help Ukraine, this hesitation should now dissipate,"" he said. 
""The same drones that are destroying Ukraine today are also aimed at Israel,"" he added.
Monday's UAV strikes followed a growing number of Russian missile attacks against Ukrainian cities. 
ue of air defences rose to the top of the agenda at meetings in Brussels last week of Nato defence ministers, who said countering Russian strikes would require a patchwork of systems.
Nato countries have been supplying Ukraine with defensive weapons since the start of the war, while the US and Europe recently pledged to send more advanced systems.
week, Ukraine told Israel it wanted to obtain weapons, including Iron Dome anti-rocket batteries, Barak (or ""Lightning"") 8 systems to defend against ship-launched missiles, Patriot surface-to-air missiles, and the new ""Iron Beam"" anti-rocket laser device.
During a speech to the Israeli parliament in March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pressured lawmakers to help, saying: ""Everybody knows that your missile defence systems are the best.""
Israel's best known air defences are its Iron Dome batteries, jointly developed with the US, which are primarily used to shoot down short-range rockets fired by Palestinian militants. During recent conflicts with militants in Gaza the system has intercepted around 90% of projectiles that crossed into Israeli territory and were headed for populated areas, according to the military. 
But analysts say it would have limited effectiveness in Ukraine, whose land mass is around 30 times that of Israel, and which Russia targets with much longer-range weapons, including cruise missiles. 
Israel's reluctance to be drawn into weapons sales to Ukraine - even amid Iran's reported arming of Russia - stems from the impact it believes the decision could have in the Middle East. 
Israel effectively treats Russia like a neighbouring power with whom it ""walks on eggshells"", according to the Israeli military analyst Alex Fishman. 
Russia has controlled much of the airspace over Israel's northern neighbour Syria since it entered the civil war in 2015 to prop up President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Israel frequently launches air strikes into Syria targeting Iranian proxy fighters and Iranian weapons transfers to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. 
""The Russians are sitting on our borders, in the Golan mountains, in Syria and along the Mediterranean shores, the navies are close all the time. Israel [can't] be in an open conflict with the Russians,"" Mr Fishman told the BBC. 
Israel's military informs Russia ahead of impending air strikes in Syria, involving a hotline officially known as ""the Russian-Israeli joint work group on prevention of dangerous incidents in Syria"".  
Preserving this - what is known in Israel as military ""freedom of action"" in Syria - has been a priority for Israel's security establishment. Its concern, among others, is that aggravating Moscow would lead to further Iranian entrenchment in Syria, and advanced weapons getting to Hezbollah. 
When an Israeli government minister at the weekend called for Israel to help arm Ukraine, the leadership got a flavour of how Moscow might respond. 
""It will destroy the relations between [Russia and Israel],"" said Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin.
Israeli officials did not comment on a media report on Wednesday that claimed Israel had not carried out strikes in Syria for over a month. The report led some to question whether its co-ordination with Moscow had deteriorated.  
Israel was also pressured again by President Zelensky, who last month spoke of his ""shock"" that ""Israel did not provide us with anything. Nothing. Zero.""
Mr Fishman, the military analyst, said Israel's historical ties with both Russia and Ukraine were as much of a consideration as the diplomatic and military constraints. 
""The first priority for Israeli foreign policy is the Jewish community,"" he said.  
Israel has seen an influx of more than a million Jews from the former Soviet Union since its collapse in 1989.
f Ukraine triggered a mass migration of at least one in eight of Russia's remaining Jewish population - by August 20,500 of Russia's estimated total of 165,000 Jews had emigrated to Israel.
Ukraine also has one of the biggest Jewish communities in Europe. An estimated 15,000 Ukrainian refugees are living in Israel, about a third of whom have qualified for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return through having at least one Jewish grandparent.
But the Jewish Agency, which facilitates migration of Jews around the world to Israel, has been under pressure in Moscow. 
In July, Russia's justice ministry accused it of violating privacy laws and said it should be shut down, triggering a diplomatic row between Israel and Russia. 
""If we sell the Ukrainians such a [weapons] system, the first step is the Russians will get rid of the Jewish agency,"" said Mr Fishman. "	/news/world-middle-east-63318659

technology	Amazon could be blamed for fake Louboutin shoe ads - EU	"Amazon could be held responsible for advertising 'fake' red-soled shoes which potentially breach designer Christian Louboutin's EU trademark.
Similar red-soled high heels are advertised on Amazon by third party vendors without Louboutin's consent.
Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) said Amazon may be accountable for any trademark infringement.
Louboutin said the platform's selling model was ""misleading the public"". Amazon says it will study the decision.
reliminary ruling by the Luxembourg-based court clears the way for Amazon to potentially be held liable for adverts for any counterfeit products sold on its site.
re has been a long-running dispute between Amazon and shoemaker Louboutin, whose high heels typically sell for at least £600.
Louboutin brought two cases against the company, in courts in Belgium and Luxembourg, in 2019 - alleging Amazon regularly displayed adverts for red-soled shoes on its marketplace without Louboutin's consent.
wo courts sought the guidance of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
In its ruling on Thursday, the CJEU said Amazon could potentially be considered responsible for alleged intellectual property breaches found in the advertisements of counterfeit shoes featuring the famous red sole.
Users of the platform may be under the impression that it is Amazon - and not the third-party seller - who markets the product ""in its name and on its behalf"", the CJEU press office told the BBC.
Court of Justice of the European Union said it was now up to two national courts, in Belgium and Luxembourg, to decide whether this was the case.
form also offers ""additional services to these third-party sellers"", in particular ""the storage and shipping of their products"" the CJEU noted.
Louboutin maintains that Amazon has illegally used the trademarked red sole ""for products identical"" to its own, and ""insists, in particular, on the fact that the disputed ads are an integral part of Amazon's commercial communication"".
rry Van Innis, Louboutin's lawyer, said the CJEU had followed the designer's arguments ""in every detail"".
""Amazon can be held accountable for the breaches as if the platform was itself the seller,"" Mr Van Innis told news agency Reuters, after the court ruling.
""Amazon will be forced to change their model and stop misleading the public by mixing up their own and third-party offers.""
Mr Van Innis said Louboutin was not currently seeking financial compensation: ""We're not talking money at this stage. We want the breaches to stop,"" he said.
feeds into part of the wider debate on trademark infringement on online marketplaces and the difficulty for users in identifying the true seller.
Intellectual property lawyer Fabian Klein, from law firm Pinsent Masons, told the BBC that platform providers should review the layout of their site to ensure that it was clearly identifiable to the public where the offers originated from.
Mr Klein said, ""If a platform is just a market place, without its own offerings - like eBay - nothing will change.""
""But for platforms that mix own offerings and third-party offerings, they should consider - from a trade mark perspective - whether they want to create a different look and feel, or other clear differentiations."""	/news/technology-64065290

technology	How to check if your Instagram posts are being hidden	"Instagram has launched a new tool to let you know if your posts are barred from being recommended to other users.
Previously, people were not told if intervention by a platform meant posts did not appear in other people's feeds - a process known as ""shadow banning"".
Instagram does not use that term. It says the new tool will inform users if there are restrictions on their account because they broke certain rules.
Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, said the decision was about ""transparency"".
""Sometimes your account can end up in a state where it's not eligible for your photos and videos to show up in [our] recommendations,"" he said. 
""If you have posted things that violate our 'recommendability' guidelines or recommendation guidelines... you can end up in a state where your content won't be recommended,"" Mr Mosseri explains.
Instagram users will be able to edit or delete posts which have fallen foul of the platform's rules. They will also be able to appeal to Instagram if they feel any content has been flagged in error.
People can check the status of their account in the Instagram app by selecting their profile, opening the menu, then selecting: settings, account, and account status.
Dr Carolina Are, a content moderation researcher at the Centre For Digital Citizens at Northumbria University, said Instagram has historically had a major issue with people having posts 'hidden' without their knowledge.
""The platform did not notify us about shadow banning,"" she said. ""For ages, Instagram denied that it was ever a thing.""
Dr Are is also a content creator on Instagram, where she often posts videos as a pole dance instructor - and says she has experienced so-called shadow banning herself.
""I personally received an apology [from Instagram] for the shadow ban of pole-dancing in 2019,"" she said. 
""They said the hashtags were blocked 'in error'... this is essentially shadow banning.""
Shadow banning can be a problem because if people are not told they have fallen foul of the rules, it means they're unable to appeal the decision or fix any mistake.
It can sometime lead to amusing consequences, with one Reddit user previously telling the BBC he didn't know he'd been shadow banned - and accidentally spent a year talking to himself.
re are some benefits to the practice, however. It allows big tech companies to block harmful content from spreading, limiting disinformation.
But Dr Are says her research has found it has had a disproportionate impact on marginalised communities.
""I think creators are very, very worried about shadow banning,"" she said. ""So it's only fair that Instagram is moving to do something about it.""
She said the problem is exacerbated by a lack of real people involved in the moderation process, which is often automated.
In her role as a researcher, Dr Are has spoken to people whose accounts were removed from Instagram due to violating its policies.
She claims to have spoken to some content creators who lost their accounts and tried to appeal, who said they weren't able to speak to a person involved in moderation.
""I still think it's a bit of a cosmetic and performative change,"" she said. ""As good as this is, without investing in human moderation, we are just going nowhere."""	/news/technology-63907699
technology	Twitter and Meta take down pro-US propaganda campaign	"witter and Meta have removed from their platforms an online propaganda campaign aimed at promoting US interests abroad, researchers say.
first major covert pro-US propaganda operation taken down by the tech giants, says a report by social media analytics firm Graphika and the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO). 
removed dozens of accounts used in the campaign in July and August.
It is not clear who is behind the propaganda operation. 
researchers say Twitter has identified the US and the UK as the ""presumptive countries of origin"", while Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the US was ""the country of origin"".
However, the researchers were clear that even though the companies named these countries, it did not prove they were behind the campaign.
""We do not have the necessary information to attribute this activity to a single country or organisation,"" the SIO told the BBC.
""What is clear, is that the activity is meant to further Western interests, including those of the US and allies.""
BBC has approached the US State Department, the UK government, Twitter and Meta for comment.
uspended accounts, some of which were set up almost five years ago, were targeting audiences in the Middle East and Central Asia in multiple languages, according to Graphika and the SIO. 
unts promoted narratives in support of the US and its allies, while opposing countries like Russia, China and Iran, the researchers said.
found the campaign mirrored some of the tactics commonly used in propaganda campaigns against the West. 
ude creating fake personas using artificially generated images and running campaigns across multiple platforms. 
researchers also found that in addition to Twitter and Meta-owned platforms, the suspended accounts were also active on a number of other social media websites globally.
Similar to previously exposed online propaganda campaigns targeting the West, some of the fake accounts in the pro-US campaign posed as independent media outlets. 
In some cases, they attempted to pass off material taken from legitimate outlets, like BBC News Russian, as their own.
researchers also found that the accounts tailored their messaging depending on the region. 
For example, in one campaign targeting Central Asia, accounts focused on praising US aid to the region and criticising Russia for engaging in ""imperialist wars"" in Africa and Syria, and for the deaths of civilians in Ukraine. 
In contrast, some of the accounts targeting Iran criticised Iranian authorities and their policies and posted about issues like women's rights.
Yet, the overall effectiveness of the campaign was limited, said Graphika's Jack Stubbs.
majority of posts and tweets reviewed ""received no more than a handful of likes or retweets"".

technology	Ukraine war: Russia dive-bombs Kyiv with 'kamikaze' drones	"Watch: People flee Kyiv building after explosion
Russia has hit Ukraine with a wave of attacks, dive-bombing the capital, Kyiv, with what appear to be Iranian-made ""kamikaze"" drones. 
Critical infrastructure was hit in the Kyiv, Dnipro and Sumy regions, with electricity cut in hundreds of towns and villages, the government says.
At least eight people were killed, four in Kyiv and four in Sumy.
Calls have mounted for sanctions on Iran, which continues to deny supplying drones to the Russian military. 
A week ago, the Ukrainian capital was hit by Russian missiles at rush hour, part of nationwide attacks which left 19 dead.
In the latest attack, starting at around 06:30 (03:30 GMT), 28 drones targeted the capital but only five hit targets, according to the Mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko.
reverberated to the rattle of gunfire as anti-aircraft batteries frantically tried to shoot them down. Video on social media appeared to show one interception. 
In the Shevchenkivskyi district, rescuers searched for survivors in the ruins of a block of flats that partially collapsed after one attack. The street was cordoned off as dozens of firefighters and emergency staff worked at the scene. Among the four people killed in the district was a pregnant woman.
Across the street from the ruined building, the offices of Ukraine's energy company were also hit. The facility was probably the intended target of the strike.
Mayor Klitschko described the attacks as a ""genocide of the Ukrainian people"", saying, ""The Russians need a Ukraine without Ukrainians."" 
uthorities, he added, were expecting air defence systems to be delivered soon to protect the capital from further drone attacks.  
""The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us,"" said President Volodymyr Zelensky, describing the attacks as ""terrorising the civilian population"".
Despite an appeal from the mayor for people to seek shelter, the city's streets were far from deserted. Between two sets of strikes, plenty of people could be seen going about their business. 
A Reuters news agency journalist reported seeing fragments of a drone used in the attack that bore the words ""For Belgorod"".
Russian border city of Belgorod has been hit several times since Russia invaded Ukraine. Moscow blames Kyiv for the attacks.
In the other attacks: 
w buzzing of the slow-moving drones is becoming familiar across Ukraine.
Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak accused Iran of being ""responsible for the murders of Ukrainians"".
Some EU foreign ministers, including those from France and Germany, are calling for new sanctions against Iran for supplying drones to Russia. 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc would investigate Tehran's participation in the conflict. 
Despite the mounting evidence of Iranian drones being used, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani insisted his country was not a ""party in the war"", adding: ""We have not supplied any weapons to the sides of the Ukraine war.""
Russia said it had hit Ukrainian military command facilities and energy systems ""in the course of 24 hours"" with long-range air- and sea-based weapons on Sunday.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week's strikes were in retaliation for the bombing of a key bridge linking Russia to occupied Crimea, which he blamed on Ukraine. 
It was the first time during the war that the centre of Kyiv had been directly targeted.
Earlier this week, Mr Putin said there was no need for more large-scale strikes on Ukraine. Most designated targets had been hit, he said, adding that it was not his aim to destroy the country. 
Russia has increased the use of combat drones in Ukraine as it seeks to avoid using long-range precision missions.

technology	Alex Belfield: Women harassed online accuse BBC of failing to help	"Female BBC employees who were harassed online by former radio presenter Alex Belfield have accused the corporation of failing to help them.
BBC is conducting an internal review ""to establish what lessons can be learned"", but the women want an independent investigation or review.
Belfield, from Nottingham, was jailed in September for stalking four men, including presenter Jeremy Vine.
jury found him not guilty of stalking the four other complainants.
However, the judge made restraining orders in relation to all eight complainants, saying in regard to the women: ""Each of them suffered a campaign of harassment by email and social media communications. Each of them suffered serious mental health problems arising from Mr Belfield's conduct.""
mplainants include BBC Radio Leeds presenter Liz Green, who worked with Belfield when he was a presenter at the station.
""We want an independent investigation, without a doubt, because we were left hung out to dry really, for a decade, and whenever I asked for help it never came,"" she said.
""I asked repeatedly for help. I was receiving emails, YouTube videos and tweets which were defamatory and damaging. I wanted it to stop and I was told there was nothing that could be done.
""My mental health has been destroyed. I've been suicidal. My confidence in what I do and who I am is eroded,  and I feel let down by my employer."" 
r complainants seeking an independent investigation are Rozina Breen, who was Belfield's boss at BBC Radio Leeds, Helen Thomas, who had been Ms Breen's boss, and Stephanie Hirst, who joined BBC Radio Leeds as a presenter after Belfield left. Only Ms Green and Ms Thomas still work for the BBC.
Ms Breen left the BBC in May and is now CEO and editor-in-chief for The Bureau of Investigative Journalism.
""Although the [not guilty] verdicts of the four Leeds women were devastating, the judge's sentencing statement was a turning point - it essentially validated what we had all lived through for over a decade,"" she said.
""We were BBC employees doing our jobs, targeted because we were in those jobs. At one point in court I was asked by the prosecuting KC what it had been like and I replied that it felt like 'having a noose around my neck throughout my BBC career'.
""I do believe there were catastrophic failings with regards to us in terms of duty of care and our health and safety and, as such, have asked for an independent review.""
Belfield started a YouTube channel after he left the BBC and used this to harass his victims, as well as posting messages on social media and sending emails.
judge, Mr Justice Saini, said that while Belfield did not physically approach or watch his victims his methods were ""in many ways much harder to deal with"".
However, Ms Breen said the BBC had not taken the effects of the harassment seriously.
""For the first seven years or so of his trolling, from 2011, we were asked to not look at offensive material, to delete it and/or forward it on, and in one case my boss [Helen Thomas] says she was told to ""man up"" by a male senior leader,"" said Ms Breen.
""At no time did the BBC refute publicly what was being said about us - defamatory, vile and abusive comments, reputationally damaging and mentally exhausting and, at times, debilitating.
""I have written to the BBC saying that there are lessons to learn clearly and that the toxic nature of online hate will only get worse for staff. It's not enough to leave us to sink or swim, as we had to in this case.""
During the trial Belfield read out what are known as ""agreed facts"", which are facts agreed as evidence by the prosecution and defence.
According to these agreed facts, there was an internal BBC investigation in relation to correspondence Ms Green received from Belfield. However, it was decided the monitoring should not continue, because the emails were ""inoffensive"", ""non-threatening"", and Belfield was deemed to pose ""no risk to BBC staff"".
Ms Green believes the BBC's inaction might have influenced the jury and led to their not guilty verdicts.
""I can only speculate that because it went on for so long, and the BBC did not act to protect us, they [the jurors] thought it cannot have been as bad as it was,"" she said.
""The judge clearly recognised what we had endured, and we got restraining orders.""
Also mentioned in the agreed facts was an internal BBC email which said Belfield was deemed to present ""no personal danger"" to another complainant - BBC Radio Northampton presenter Bernard Spedding - or any other BBC staff.
However, the trial heard that Mr Spedding almost killed himself as a result of Belfield's harassment.
""He was seconds away from taking his own life as a result of your conduct,"" the judge told Belfield in his sentencing remarks.
""You made this highly successful and confident radio presenter lose all joy in life and turned him into a shell.""
One of Ms Green's main concerns is that the BBC has no stalking policy.
""I really do want that to happen,"" she said. ""Digital stalking, which is what happened here, is increasingly prevalent and very damaging, and I feel there needs to be a strategy in place to protect the individual being stalked.""
review will be led by Peter Johnston, the BBC's deputy director of editorial standards.
According to an internal email, the aim is ""to provide recommendations to the BBC on how it can best support colleagues facing online stalking or significant social media harassment"".
A statement from the BBC press office said: ""We know this has been very difficult for those involved and we continue to provide support to current and former staff.
""We also want to learn from this to ensure we offer the best possible support to all colleagues, who may sadly experience the threat and risks of online stalking in the future.""

technology	Young children exploited on OnlyFans, says US agent	"A senior US investigator says it is still easy to find child abuse images that have originated on OnlyFans.
form told the BBC it had acted to tackle illegal content and it was impossible for them to verify claims without evidence.
But an investigator said images of young children apparently being exploited could be traced to the site.
A BBC News investigation last year revealed children had sold and appeared in videos on the British website.
Leaked documents also showed moderators were allowed to give multiple warnings to accounts posting illegal content before deciding to close them.
Now, the company's bosses told BBC Newsnight they had taken firm action following the investigation.
Amrapali Gan was made chief executive of OnlyFans last year. She says the company is the safest social media site in the world.
""We actively work with law enforcement. If anyone makes the mistake thinking they can upload illegal content, we will report them,"" she says. ""We're truly the safest and most inclusive social media platform.""
However, Newsnight has found further evidence that the site is failing to prevent illegal content from appearing on its site.
A US investigator says that in just an hour they were able to find ten child abuse images on other platforms that had originated on OnlyFans. They believe the photos have been created within the last six months and include watermarks from the website. 
Some images show pre-pubescent children being directed to produce abusive images, according to the agent, who specialises in investigating paedophile rings online.
""The youngest was around five years old,"" the investigator told the BBC, adding that others were about 12 years of age. ""Whatever their [OnlyFans'] current methodology, there's still cracks that it's still slipping through"", they added.
In a statement, OnlyFans said: ""When the BBC raised this anonymous claim, we asked them for evidence to enable us to investigate."" 
It added: ""The BBC refused to provide any details or evidence preventing OnlyFans from investigating this claim.""
BBC has agreed not to identify the agent who redacted account usernames to protect their investigation.
NSPCC said a small number of reports made within the last year to its counselling service, Childline, also suggested OnlyFans continued to host images of child abuse. It said one mother claimed that images of her 10-year-old daughter had been uploaded to the site.
""Children are not only consuming content on OnlyFans, but also are able to produce content"", says Hannah Ruschen from the NSPCC.
OnlyFans Uncovered
OnlyFans is the British website that's been credited with changing sex work forever. The BBC has been invited inside its offices to meet its stars and bosses.

A US charity also recently discovered that language banned by the site was still widely in use, including a term referencing young girls.
OnlyFans said a ""glitch"" enabled some text to be ported from other websites and it had now removed the term highlighted by the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative.
mpany does not believe there is a significant amount of illegal content on its site and said it reviews every piece of content posted on its platform, including video, photos and text.
""We've invested significantly in improving our age and identity verification tools"", said Keily Blair, chief strategy officer for OnlyFans.
""One of the issues that was raised was being able to pass off the account that you've opened to somebody else, that's not now possible.""
Ms Blair said OnlyFans does more to address underage use than anyone other social media site. ""The [rest of] the industry needs to do better around online safety"", she added.
Founded by Essex businessman and former chief executive, Tim Stokely, in 2016, OnlyFans has since grown significantly. Its users spent more than £4bn on purchasing photos and videos shared on the site, last year.
Ms Gan said 80% of the company's staff work on content moderation and it would continue to invest in this area. She also said the website's decision, last year, to ban pornography - which was quickly reversed - was a ""learning experience"".
OnlyFans is not alone in taking steps to address online safety. The government's long-delayed online safety bill proposes heavy fines for websites failing to protect children. 
Last year, it also provided Ofcom with limited powers to penalise companies which are allowing harmful content on video-sharing platforms. But Ofcom's role does not involve assessing individual videos and no companies have been sanctioned to date.
NSPCC said neither the current regulation nor the planned legislation go far enough. ""We want to see senior manager liability when Ofcom identifies failure to comply with the children's safety duties, rather than just failure to comply with information requests"", added Ms Ruschen.

technology	WhatsApp groups help get food to those who need it	"""Hey everyone, there's a food delivery today at 3pm."" ""Thanks for the curry, it was amazing!"" ""I made pickles this week."" ""Should we all have an outing somewhere soon?""
re the kind of messages that fly back and forth, pretty much constantly, on Rachel Diamond's phone.
Ms Diamond is the founder of My Yard, a charity. For each of the communities she is plugged into, she runs a WhatsApp group, such as the one she set up in 2018 for dozens of people who live on the Grange Farm Estate in Harrow, north-west London. 
""It not only feeds people, it brings the community together,"" explains Ms Diamond.
Many residents on the estate are among the millions of people in the UK who are currently experiencing food insecurity.
f living crisis has sent demand for food aid soaring. You'll have heard of food banks but food aid takes many different forms. Some are less visible than others and, around the country, many people are now quietly organising the sharing and redistribution of food themselves. 
Often, it starts with a WhatsApp group for friends and neighbours.
When she first started working with the Grange Farm Estate community, Ms Diamond found that using a messaging app allowed her to organise deliveries of food donated by supermarkets and local businesses at the residents' convenience.
""It was a stigma-free way of people accessing food and getting to know each other,"" she says. ""For me, it's really, really special.""
Now she has about 20 groups that are swapping messages about food.
It has helped her keep in touch with those who have dietary requirements or particular preferences. Some of the elderly people find that the price of Spam has gone up a lot lately, so she gets dented tins unwanted by shops.
Everyone is different, she stresses, asking me to imagine freezing a supermarket in time and having a look inside every shopper's basket: ""I bet you'd never find two baskets with the same things in. That is people's lives.""
She aims to supply a diverse variety of food that suits everyone. But due to inflation, the overall need is growing. ""It's devastating,"" says Ms Diamond, referring to the cost of living crisis.
On one recent delivery, a van arrived packed with pallets of food including fresh fruit and vegetables, breads and yoghurt, among other items. Everything went in about ten minutes, she says. It used to take noticeably longer.
While Ms Diamond has been running WhatsApp groups for communities for years, new ones are springing up all the time elsewhere.
Last November, Camille Desprez, founder of Food Next Door, launched a group for the residents of her block of flats in Brixton so that they could share surplus food with one another and cut down on waste.
""[It's] working super well. We are able to save food almost every week,"" she says.
Ms Desprez has since developed the idea into the Food Next Door project, which has more than 100 members and which is establishing WhatsApp groups across more than a dozen neighbourhoods in London and Paris.
One benefit, she adds, is that people can save money on food, noting that among those currently taking part are some refugees.
More technology of business:
Zero Waste initiatives that help people in poverty are a ""positive side-effect"" of the movement, says Zero Waste consultant Rachelle Strauss.
""People are genuinely very frightened and very scared about their future,"" she adds, noting the seriousness of the current situation.
While WhatsApp, being so widely used, has its benefits, it also has downsides, says Prof Reem Talhouk at Northumbria University. The messaging app sometimes goes down for hours at a time. This could be significant for anyone depending on the app for aid or their livelihood.
Alternative apps include Telegram and Signal. Volunteers for the Foodshare Allotment at Nottingham Trent University stay in touch via Microsoft Teams chat. Some food from their allotment goes to food banks, community kitchens and local families.
And plenty of people share food without much need for the latest technology - such as Ursula Juta, senior project officer at the Norfolk Rivers Trust, who puts a basket full of surplus veg from her allotment on her garden wall. People in her village can enjoy the produce for free.
Another issue with WhatsApp and other social media platforms raised by Prof Talhouk is that they can sometimes be used for misinformation, scamming and harassment.
""That's always something that we need to consider,"" she says.
And yet the potential power of messaging apps is hard to overstate. Another food aid provider who uses WhatsApp is Emily Connally, managing director of Cherwell Collective, a non-profit in Oxford.
""We can mobilise 200 people with one text,"" she says, noting how she doesn't get as immediate a response on Facebook as she does via her WhatsApp group. This matters because she sometimes receives a donation of food that is near to its use by date, meaning it must be distributed very quickly.
Pret a Manger recently donated a surplus of 165 sandwiches. A message went out to the WhatsApp group and people had collected all the sandwiches within an hour, says Dr Connally. 
Hundreds of locals rely on the food aid that she and her colleagues provide. ""We've seen a pretty dramatic increase and I think it will get much, much worse,"" she says, referring to rising food prices.
Cherwell Collective was founded during the pandemic. Prof Talhouk suggests that local community groups that respond to crises might need support, for example from local authorities, to continue their work long-term.
Back at My Yard, Rachel Diamond stresses that the impact of the groups she runs is not restricted to food aid. People help each other out with other problems, too. They confront loneliness and strengthen social bonds.
""I find it absolutely fascinating,"" she says, ""watching people grow in their friendships - and their hope""."	/news/business-63461678
